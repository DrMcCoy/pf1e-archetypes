					<p>Summoners are proficient with all simple weapons and light armor. A summoner can cast summoner spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, a summoner wearing medium or heavy armor, or using a shield, incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component. A summoner still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells granted by other classes.</p>

					<p>A summoner casts arcane spells drawn from the summoner spell list. (The unchained summoner&#146;s spell list is different from that presented in the Advanced Player&#146;s Guide.) He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time.</p>
					<p>To learn or cast a spell, a summoner must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a summoner&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the summoner&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>A summoner can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level each day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Summoner. In addition, he gains bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells on page 17 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>A summoner&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A summoner begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the summoner&#146;s choice. At each new summoner level, he gains one or more new spells as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Summoner Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a summoner knows is not affected by his Charisma score. The numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.)</p>
					<p>Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third summoner level thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), a summoner can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the summoner &#147;loses&#148; the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level summoner spell the summoner can cast. A summoner can swap out only a single spell at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known.</p>
					<p>A summoner doesn&#146;t need to prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the level.</p>

					<p>A summoner learns a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots (due to metamagic feats, for example) consume spell slots as normal.</p>

				<name type="string">Eidolon</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A summoner begins play with the ability to summon to his side a powerful outsider called an eidolon. The eidolon forms a link with the summoner, who forever after summons an aspect of the same creature. Each eidolon has a subtype, chosen when the eidolon is first summoned, that determines its origin and many of its abilities. An eidolon must be within one alignment step of the summoner who calls it (so a neutral good summoner can call a neutral, lawful good, or chaotic good eidolon) and can speak all of his languages. An eidolon is treated as a summoned creature, except it is not sent back to its home plane until reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to or greater than its Constitution score. In addition, due to its tie to its summoner, an eidolon can touch and attack creatures warded by protection from evil and similar effects that prevent contact with summoned creatures.</p>
					<p>A summoner can summon his eidolon in a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform. When summoned in this way, the eidolon&#146;s hit points are unchanged from the last time it was summoned. The only exception to this is if the eidolon was slain, in which case it returns with half its normal hit points. The eidolon does not heal naturally. The eidolon remains until dismissed by the summoner (a standard action). If the eidolon is sent back to its home plane due to death, it cannot be summoned again until the following day. The eidolon cannot be sent back to its home plane by means of dispel magic, but spells such as dismissal and banishment function normally. If the summoner is unconscious, asleep, or killed, his eidolon is immediately banished.</p>
					<p>The eidolon takes a form shaped by the summoner&#146;s desires. The eidolon&#146;s Hit Dice, saving throws, skills, feats, and abilities are tied to the summoner&#146;s class level and increase as the summoner gains levels. In addition, each eidolon gains a pool of evolution points based on the summoner&#146;s class level that can be used to give the eidolon different abilities and powers. Whenever the summoner gains a level, he must decide how these points are spent, and they are set until he gains another level of summoner.</p>
					<p>The eidolon&#146;s physical appearance is up to the summoner, but it always appears as some sort of fantastical creature appropriate to its subtype. This control is not fine enough to make the eidolon appear like a specific creature. The eidolon also bears a glowing rune that is identical to a rune that appears on the summoner&#146;s forehead as long as the eidolon is summoned. While this rune can be hidden through mundane means, it cannot be concealed through magic that changes appearance, such as alter self or polymorph (although invisibility does conceal it as long as the spell lasts).</p>

				<name type="string">Life Link</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a summoner forms a close bond with his eidolon. Whenever the eidolon takes enough damage to send it back to its home plane, as a reaction to the damage, the summoner can sacrifice any number of hit points he has without using an action. Each hit point sacrificed in this way prevents 1 point of damage dealt to the eidolon. This can prevent the eidolon from being sent back to its home plane.</p>
					<p>In addition, the eidolon and the summoner must remain within 100 feet of one another for the eidolon to remain at full strength. If the eidolon is beyond 100 feet but closer than 1,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 50%. If the eidolon is more than 1,000 feet away but closer than 10,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 75%. If the eidolon is more than 10,000 feet away, it is immediately returned to its home plane. Current hit points lost in this way are not restored when the eidolon gets closer to its summoner, but its maximum hit point total does climb to the levels indicated and eventually returns to normal.</p>

				<name type="string">Summon Monster I</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a summoner can cast summon monster I as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Drawing on this ability uses up the same power that the summoner uses to call his eidolon. As a result, he can use this ability only when his eidolon is not summoned. He can cast this spell as a standard action, and the creatures remain for 1 minute per level (instead of 1 round per level). At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the power of this ability increases by 1 spell level, allowing him to summon more powerful creatures (to a maximum of summon monster IX at 17th level). At 19th level, this ability can be used as gate or summon monster IX. If used as gate, the summoner must pay any required material components. A summoner cannot have more than one summon monster or gate spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon monster or gate from this spell-like ability immediately ends. These summon spells are considered to be part of the summoner&#146;s spell list for the purposes of spell trigger and spell completion items. In addition, the summoner can expend uses of this ability to fulfill the construction requirements of any magic item he creates, so long as he can use this ability to cast the required spell.</p>

While merged in this way, the summoner is protected from harm and cannot be the target of spells or effects. All effects and spells currently targeting the summoner are suspended until the summoner emerges from the eidolon (although durations continue to expire).</p>

His Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores change to match the base scores of his eidolon. He can choose to have any gear that he carries become absorbed by his new form, as with spells from the polymorph subschool. Items with continuous effects continue to function while absorbed in this way. The summoner loses his natural attacks and all racial traits (except bonus feats, skills, and languages) in favor of the abilities granted by his eidolon&#146;s evolutions. The summoner retains all of his class features. The summoner can keep this form for a number of minutes per day equal to his summoner level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The summoner can end this effect as a free action.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>-</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>There are those who take a different path when pursuing the arcane arts, reaching across the boundaries of the world to the far-f lung planes to call forth all manner of creatures to do their bidding. Known as summoners, these arcane practitioners form close bonds with particular outsiders, known as eidolons, which increase in power along with their callers. In the end, summoners and their eidolons become linked, sharing shards of the same souls.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>Most of the summoner&#146;s class features are the same as those of the class&#146;s original design&#151;the biggest change comes to the eidolon. The unchained summoner selects a subtype for his eidolon (such as angel, demon, or protean), which determines a number of its evolutions and helps to shape the eidolon&#146;s general attitude and appearance. In addition, some of the evolutions are now tied to one or more subtypes and base forms, to make eidolons that better match the expected appearances and abilities of such creatures. Finally, the summoner spell list has been greatly revised, removing a number of imbalances.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>2d6 x 10 gp (average 70 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Summoner (Unchained)'s class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Summoners are proficient with all simple weapons and light armor. A summoner can cast summoner spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, a summoner wearing medium or heavy armor, or using a shield, incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component. A summoner still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells granted by other classes.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A summoner casts arcane spells drawn from the summoner spell list. (The unchained summoner&#146;s spell list is different from that presented in the Advanced Player&#146;s Guide.) He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a summoner must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a summoner&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the summoner&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>A summoner can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level each day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Summoner. In addition, he gains bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells on page 17 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A summoner&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A summoner begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the summoner&#146;s choice. At each new summoner level, he gains one or more new spells as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Summoner Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a summoner knows is not affected by his Charisma score. The numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.)</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third summoner level thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), a summoner can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the summoner &#147;loses&#148; the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level summoner spell the summoner can cast. A summoner can swap out only a single spell at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known.</p>
			<p>A summoner doesn&#146;t need to prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>A summoner learns a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots (due to metamagic feats, for example) consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Eidolon: </b>A summoner begins play with the ability to summon to his side a powerful outsider called an eidolon. The eidolon forms a link with the summoner, who forever after summons an aspect of the same creature. Each eidolon has a subtype, chosen when the eidolon is first summoned, that determines its origin and many of its abilities. An eidolon must be within one alignment step of the summoner who calls it (so a neutral good summoner can call a neutral, lawful good, or chaotic good eidolon) and can speak all of his languages. An eidolon is treated as a summoned creature, except it is not sent back to its home plane until reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to or greater than its Constitution score. In addition, due to its tie to its summoner, an eidolon can touch and attack creatures warded by protection from evil and similar effects that prevent contact with summoned creatures.</p>
			<p>A summoner can summon his eidolon in a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform. When summoned in this way, the eidolon&#146;s hit points are unchanged from the last time it was summoned. The only exception to this is if the eidolon was slain, in which case it returns with half its normal hit points. The eidolon does not heal naturally. The eidolon remains until dismissed by the summoner (a standard action). If the eidolon is sent back to its home plane due to death, it cannot be summoned again until the following day. The eidolon cannot be sent back to its home plane by means of dispel magic, but spells such as dismissal and banishment function normally. If the summoner is unconscious, asleep, or killed, his eidolon is immediately banished.</p>
			<p>The eidolon takes a form shaped by the summoner&#146;s desires. The eidolon&#146;s Hit Dice, saving throws, skills, feats, and abilities are tied to the summoner&#146;s class level and increase as the summoner gains levels. In addition, each eidolon gains a pool of evolution points based on the summoner&#146;s class level that can be used to give the eidolon different abilities and powers. Whenever the summoner gains a level, he must decide how these points are spent, and they are set until he gains another level of summoner.</p>
			<p>The eidolon&#146;s physical appearance is up to the summoner, but it always appears as some sort of fantastical creature appropriate to its subtype. This control is not fine enough to make the eidolon appear like a specific creature. The eidolon also bears a glowing rune that is identical to a rune that appears on the summoner&#146;s forehead as long as the eidolon is summoned. While this rune can be hidden through mundane means, it cannot be concealed through magic that changes appearance, such as alter self or polymorph (although invisibility does conceal it as long as the spell lasts).</p>
			<p><b>Life Link (Su): </b>At 1st level, a summoner forms a close bond with his eidolon. Whenever the eidolon takes enough damage to send it back to its home plane, as a reaction to the damage, the summoner can sacrifice any number of hit points he has without using an action. Each hit point sacrificed in this way prevents 1 point of damage dealt to the eidolon. This can prevent the eidolon from being sent back to its home plane.</p>
			<p>In addition, the eidolon and the summoner must remain within 100 feet of one another for the eidolon to remain at full strength. If the eidolon is beyond 100 feet but closer than 1,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 50%. If the eidolon is more than 1,000 feet away but closer than 10,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 75%. If the eidolon is more than 10,000 feet away, it is immediately returned to its home plane. Current hit points lost in this way are not restored when the eidolon gets closer to its summoner, but its maximum hit point total does climb to the levels indicated and eventually returns to normal.</p>
			<p><b>Summon Monster I (Sp): </b>At 1st level, a summoner can cast summon monster I as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Drawing on this ability uses up the same power that the summoner uses to call his eidolon. As a result, he can use this ability only when his eidolon is not summoned. He can cast this spell as a standard action, and the creatures remain for 1 minute per level (instead of 1 round per level). At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the power of this ability increases by 1 spell level, allowing him to summon more powerful creatures (to a maximum of summon monster IX at 17th level). At 19th level, this ability can be used as gate or summon monster IX. If used as gate, the summoner must pay any required material components. A summoner cannot have more than one summon monster or gate spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon monster or gate from this spell-like ability immediately ends. These summon spells are considered to be part of the summoner&#146;s spell list for the purposes of spell trigger and spell completion items. In addition, the summoner can expend uses of this ability to fulfill the construction requirements of any magic item he creates, so long as he can use this ability to cast the required spell.</p>
			<p><b>Bond Senses (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a summoner can, as a standard action, share the senses of his eidolon, hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and touching everything the eidolon does. He can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to his summoner level. There is no maximum range to this effect, but the eidolon and the summoner must be on the same plane. The summoner can end this effect as a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Shield Ally (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a summoner is within his eidolon&#146;s reach, the summoner gains a +2 shield bonus to his Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on his saving throws. This bonus does not apply if the eidolon is grappled, helpless, paralyzed, stunned, or unconscious.</p>
			<p><b>Maker&#146;s Call (Su): </b>At 6th level, as a standard action, a summoner can call his eidolon to his side. This functions as dimension door, using the summoner&#146;s caster level. When this ability is used, the eidolon appears adjacent to the summoner (or as close as possible if all adjacent spaces are occupied). If the eidolon is out of range, the ability is wasted. The summoner can use this ability once per day at 6th level, plus one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 6th.</p>
			<p><b>Transposition (Su): </b>At 8th level, a summoner can use his maker&#146;s call ability to swap locations with his eidolon. If the eidolon occupies more squares than the summoner, the summoner can appear in any square occupied by the eidolon. The eidolon must occupy the square that was occupied by the summoner if able, or as close as possible if it is not able.</p>
			<p><b>Aspect (Su): </b>At 10th level, a summoner can divert up to 2 points from his eidolon&#146;s evolution pool to add evolutions to himself. He cannot select any evolution that the eidolon could not possess, and he must be able to meet the requirements as well (except for subtype requirements, so long as his eidolon meets the subtype requirement). He cannot select the ability increase evolution through this ability. Any points spent in this way are taken from the eidolon&#146;s evolution pool (reducing the total number available to the eidolon). The summoner can change the evolutions granted by these points anytime he can change the eidolon&#146;s evolutions.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Shield Ally (Su): </b>At 12th level, whenever an ally is within reach of the summoner&#146;s eidolon, the ally gains a +2 shield bonus to its Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on its saving throws. If this ally is the summoner, these bonuses increase to +4. This bonus does not apply if the eidolon is grappled, helpless, paralyzed, stunned, or unconscious.</p>
			<p><b>Life Bond (Su): </b>At 14th level, the summoner&#146;s life becomes linked to his eidolon&#146;s. As long as the eidolon has 1 or more hit points, the summoner is protected from harm. Damage in excess of that which would reduce the summoner to 0 hit points is instead transferred to the eidolon. This damage is transferred 1 point at a time, meaning that as soon as the eidolon is reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to its Constitution score, all excess damage remains with the summoner. Effects that cause death but don&#146;t deal damage are unaffected by this ability. This ability does not affect spells such as baleful polymorph, flesh to stone, imprisonment, or other spells that don&#146;t deal damage.</p>
			<p><b>Merge Forms (Su): </b>At 16th level, as a full-round action, a summoner can touch his eidolon and the two can merge forms. This transformation includes all of the summoner&#146;s gear. While merged in this way, the summoner is protected from harm and cannot be the target of spells or effects. All effects and spells currently targeting the summoner are suspended until the summoner emerges from the eidolon (although durations continue to expire).</p>
			<p>The summoner can cast spells while inside the eidolon by taking control of the eidolon for the duration of the casting. Any material components used for these spells are taken from the summoner&#146;s gear, even though they are otherwise inaccessible. The summoner can direct all of the eidolon&#146;s actions while merged, can perceive through its senses, and can speak through its voice.</p>
			<p>The summoner can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his summoner level. He can end this effect at any time as a swift action. The summoner emerges in a square adjacent to the eidolon if able. If the eidolon is returned to its home plane while the summoner is merged with it, the summoner is immediately ejected, takes 4d6 points of damage, and is stunned for 1 round.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Aspect (Su): </b>At 18th level, a summoner can divert more of his eidolon&#146;s evolutions to himself. This ability functions as the aspect ability, but the maximum number of evolution points the summoner can divert increases to 6. In addition, the eidolon loses 1 point from its evolution pool for every 2 points (or fraction thereof ) diverted to the summoner instead of losing 1 point from the evolution pool for each point diverted.</p>
			<p><b>Twin Eidolon (Su) </b>: At 20th level, a summoner and his eidolon share a true connection. As a standard action, the summoner can assume the shape of his eidolon, copying all of its evolutions, form, and abilities. His Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores change to match the base scores of his eidolon. He can choose to have any gear that he carries become absorbed by his new form, as with spells from the polymorph subschool. Items with continuous effects continue to function while absorbed in this way. The summoner loses his natural attacks and all racial traits (except bonus feats, skills, and languages) in favor of the abilities granted by his eidolon&#146;s evolutions. The summoner retains all of his class features. The summoner can keep this form for a number of minutes per day equal to his summoner level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The summoner can end this effect as a free action.</p>

This control is not fine enough to make the eidolon appear like a specific creature. The eidolon also bears a glowing rune that is identical to a rune that appears on the summoner&#146;s forehead as long as the eidolon is summoned. While this rune can be hidden through mundane means, it cannot be concealed through magic that changes appearance, such as alter self or polymorph (although invisibility does conceal it as long as the spell lasts).</p>

					<p>At 1st level, a summoner forms a close bond with his eidolon. Whenever the eidolon takes enough damage to send it back to its home plane, as a reaction to the damage, the summoner can sacrifice any number of hit points he has without using an action. Each hit point sacrificed in this way prevents 1 point of damage dealt to the eidolon. This can prevent the eidolon from being sent back to its home plane.</p>
					<p>In addition, the eidolon and the summoner must remain within 100 feet of one another for the eidolon to remain at full strength. If the eidolon is beyond 100 feet but closer than 1,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 50%. If the eidolon is more than 1,000 feet away but closer than 10,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 75%. If the eidolon is more than 10,000 feet away, it is immediately returned to its home plane. Current hit points lost in this way are not restored when the eidolon gets closer to its summoner, but its maximum hit point total does climb to the levels indicated and eventually returns to normal.</p>

					<p>At 1st level, a summoner can cast summon monster I as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Drawing on this ability uses up the same power that the summoner uses to call his eidolon. As a result, he can use this ability only when his eidolon is not summoned. He can cast this spell as a standard action, and the creatures remain for 1 minute per level (instead of 1 round per level). At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the power of this ability increases by 1 spell level, allowing him to summon more powerful creatures (to a maximum of summon monster IX at 17th level). At 19th level, this ability can be used as gate or summon monster IX. If used as gate, the summoner must pay any required material components. A summoner cannot have more than one summon monster or gate spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon monster or gate from this spell-like ability immediately ends. These summon spells are considered to be part of the summoner&#146;s spell list for the purposes of spell trigger and spell completion items.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Reflecting the connected nature of Imbrex, a twinned summoner and his eidolon appear identical save for any obvious differences, such as evolutions or equipment.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>There are those who take a different path when pursuing the arcane arts, reaching across the boundaries of the world to the far-f lung planes to call forth all manner of creatures to do their bidding. Known as summoners, these arcane practitioners form close bonds with particular outsiders, known as eidolons, which increase in power along with their callers. In the end, summoners and their eidolons become linked, sharing shards of the same souls.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>Most of the summoner&#146;s class features are the same as those of the class&#146;s original design&#151;the biggest change comes to the eidolon. The unchained summoner selects a subtype for his eidolon (such as angel, demon, or protean), which determines a number of its evolutions and helps to shape the eidolon&#146;s general attitude and appearance. In addition, some of the evolutions are now tied to one or more subtypes and base forms, to make eidolons that better match the expected appearances and abilities of such creatures. Finally, the summoner spell list has been greatly revised, removing a number of imbalances.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>2d6 x 10 gp (average 70 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Summoner (Unchained)'s class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Summoners are proficient with all simple weapons and light armor. A summoner can cast summoner spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, a summoner wearing medium or heavy armor, or using a shield, incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component. A summoner still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells granted by other classes.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A summoner casts arcane spells drawn from the summoner spell list. (The unchained summoner&#146;s spell list is different from that presented in the Advanced Player&#146;s Guide.) He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a summoner must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a summoner&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the summoner&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>A summoner can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level each day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Summoner. In addition, he gains bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells on page 17 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A summoner&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A summoner begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the summoner&#146;s choice. At each new summoner level, he gains one or more new spells as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Summoner Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a summoner knows is not affected by his Charisma score. The numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.)</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third summoner level thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), a summoner can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the summoner &#147;loses&#148; the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level summoner spell the summoner can cast. A summoner can swap out only a single spell at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known.</p>
			<p>A summoner doesn&#146;t need to prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>A summoner learns a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots (due to metamagic feats, for example) consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Eidolon: </b>A summoner begins play with the ability to summon to his side a powerful outsider called an eidolon. The eidolon forms a link with the summoner, who forever after summons an aspect of the same creature. Each eidolon has a subtype, chosen when the eidolon is first summoned, that determines its origin and many of its abilities. An eidolon must be within one alignment step of the summoner who calls it (so a neutral good summoner can call a neutral, lawful good, or chaotic good eidolon) and can speak all of his languages. An eidolon is treated as a summoned creature, except it is not sent back to its home plane until reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to or greater than its Constitution score. In addition, due to its tie to its summoner, an eidolon can touch and attack creatures warded by protection from evil and similar effects that prevent contact with summoned creatures.</p>
			<p>A summoner can summon his eidolon in a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform. When summoned in this way, the eidolon&#146;s hit points are unchanged from the last time it was summoned. The only exception to this is if the eidolon was slain, in which case it returns with half its normal hit points. The eidolon does not heal naturally. The eidolon remains until dismissed by the summoner (a standard action). If the eidolon is sent back to its home plane due to death, it cannot be summoned again until the following day. The eidolon cannot be sent back to its home plane by means of dispel magic, but spells such as dismissal and banishment function normally. If the summoner is unconscious, asleep, or killed, his eidolon is immediately banished.</p>
			<p>The eidolon takes a form shaped by the summoner&#146;s desires. The eidolon&#146;s Hit Dice, saving throws, skills, feats, and abilities are tied to the summoner&#146;s class level and increase as the summoner gains levels. In addition, each eidolon gains a pool of evolution points based on the summoner&#146;s class level that can be used to give the eidolon different abilities and powers. Whenever the summoner gains a level, he must decide how these points are spent, and they are set until he gains another level of summoner.</p>
			<p>The eidolon&#146;s physical appearance is up to the summoner, but it always appears as some sort of fantastical creature appropriate to its subtype. This control is not fine enough to make the eidolon appear like a specific creature. The eidolon also bears a glowing rune that is identical to a rune that appears on the summoner&#146;s forehead as long as the eidolon is summoned. While this rune can be hidden through mundane means, it cannot be concealed through magic that changes appearance, such as alter self or polymorph (although invisibility does conceal it as long as the spell lasts).</p>
			<p><b>Life Link (Su): </b>At 1st level, a summoner forms a close bond with his eidolon. Whenever the eidolon takes enough damage to send it back to its home plane, as a reaction to the damage, the summoner can sacrifice any number of hit points he has without using an action. Each hit point sacrificed in this way prevents 1 point of damage dealt to the eidolon. This can prevent the eidolon from being sent back to its home plane.</p>
			<p>In addition, the eidolon and the summoner must remain within 100 feet of one another for the eidolon to remain at full strength. If the eidolon is beyond 100 feet but closer than 1,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 50%. If the eidolon is more than 1,000 feet away but closer than 10,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 75%. If the eidolon is more than 10,000 feet away, it is immediately returned to its home plane. Current hit points lost in this way are not restored when the eidolon gets closer to its summoner, but its maximum hit point total does climb to the levels indicated and eventually returns to normal.</p>
			<p><b>Summon Monster I (Sp): </b>At 1st level, a summoner can cast summon monster I as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Drawing on this ability uses up the same power that the summoner uses to call his eidolon. As a result, he can use this ability only when his eidolon is not summoned. He can cast this spell as a standard action, and the creatures remain for 1 minute per level (instead of 1 round per level). At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the power of this ability increases by 1 spell level, allowing him to summon more powerful creatures (to a maximum of summon monster IX at 17th level). At 19th level, this ability can be used as gate or summon monster IX. If used as gate, the summoner must pay any required material components. A summoner cannot have more than one summon monster or gate spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon monster or gate from this spell-like ability immediately ends. These summon spells are considered to be part of the summoner&#146;s spell list for the purposes of spell trigger and spell completion items. In addition, the summoner can expend uses of this ability to fulfill the construction requirements of any magic item he creates, so long as he can use this ability to cast the required spell.</p>
			<p><b>Twinned Eidolon: </b>The twinned summoner&#146;s eidolon is restricted to the biped base form. An unchained summoner&#146;s eidolon is instead restricted to the twinned eidolon subtype (see below). If the summoner&#146;s natural size is smaller than Medium, the twinned summoner&#146;s eidolon must be Small. This ability may require a different base form or subtype to match the twinned summoner&#146;s natural form, at the GM&#146;s discretion, if the twinned summoner is not a bipedal creature.</p>
			<p><b>Bond Senses (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a summoner can, as a standard action, share the senses of his eidolon, hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and touching everything the eidolon does. He can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to his summoner level. There is no maximum range to this effect, but the eidolon and the summoner must be on the same plane. The summoner can end this effect as a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Teamwork Feats (Ex): </b>At 4th level and at 12th level, a twinned summoner gains a bonus teamwork feat. He must meet the prerequisites of the selected teamwork feat. The twinned summoner automatically grants all of his teamwork feats to his eidolon. The eidolon doesn&#146;t need to meet the prerequisites of these teamwork feats.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces shield ally and greater shield ally.</p>
			<p><b>Twinned Transposition (Su): </b>At 6th level, as a standard action, a twinned summoner can swap locations with his eidolon as if each were using dimension door, using the twinned summoner&#146;s caster level. If the eidolon is out of range, the ability is wasted. If either the twinned summoner or his eidolon occupies more squares than the other, each must occupy one or more squares that were occupied by the other if possible, or as close as possible if not. The twinned summoner can use this ability once per day at 6th level, plus one additional time per day for every 4 levels beyond 6th. At 8th level, he can use this ability as a swift action.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces maker&#146;s call and transposition.</p>
			<p><b>Aspect (Su): </b>At 10th level, a summoner can divert up to 2 points from his eidolon&#146;s evolution pool to add evolutions to himself. He cannot select any evolution that the eidolon could not possess, and he must be able to meet the requirements as well (except for subtype requirements, so long as his eidolon meets the subtype requirement). He cannot select the ability increase evolution through this ability. Any points spent in this way are taken from the eidolon&#146;s evolution pool (reducing the total number available to the eidolon). The summoner can change the evolutions granted by these points anytime he can change the eidolon&#146;s evolutions.</p>
			<p><b>Life Bond (Su): </b>At 14th level, the summoner&#146;s life becomes linked to his eidolon&#146;s. As long as the eidolon has 1 or more hit points, the summoner is protected from harm. Damage in excess of that which would reduce the summoner to 0 hit points is instead transferred to the eidolon. This damage is transferred 1 point at a time, meaning that as soon as the eidolon is reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to its Constitution score, all excess damage remains with the summoner. Effects that cause death but don&#146;t deal damage are unaffected by this ability. This ability does not affect spells such as baleful polymorph, flesh to stone, imprisonment, or other spells that don&#146;t deal damage.</p>
			<p><b>Twin Summoner (Su): </b>At 16th level, a twinned summoner can touch his eidolon as a standard action, enhancing its similarity to the summoner. The eidolon loses any natural weapons or size increases gained from evolutions, and its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores change to match the base scores of the summoner. The eidolon can cast any of the summoner&#146;s spells known using the summoner&#146;s caster level and spell slots. It doesn&#146;t gain the benefit of any of the summoner&#146;s items, feats, or other effects that affect spellcasting. The eidolon can keep this form for a number of minutes per day equal to the summoner&#146;s class level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The summoner can end this effect as a free action.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the merge forms class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Aspect (Su): </b>At 18th level, a summoner can divert more of his eidolon&#146;s evolutions to himself. This ability functions as the aspect ability, but the maximum number of evolution points the summoner can divert increases to 6. In addition, the eidolon loses 1 point from its evolution pool for every 2 points (or fraction thereof ) diverted to the summoner instead of losing 1 point from the evolution pool for each point diverted.</p>
			<p><b>Twin Eidolon (Su) </b>: At 20th level, a summoner and his eidolon share a true connection. As a standard action, the summoner can assume the shape of his eidolon, copying all of its evolutions, form, and abilities. His Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores change to match the base scores of his eidolon. He can choose to have any gear that he carries become absorbed by his new form, as with spells from the polymorph subschool. Items with continuous effects continue to function while absorbed in this way. The summoner loses his natural attacks and all racial traits (except bonus feats, skills, and languages) in favor of the abilities granted by his eidolon&#146;s evolutions. The summoner retains all of his class features. The summoner can keep this form for a number of minutes per day equal to his summoner level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The summoner can end this effect as a free action.</p>

					<p>At 1st level, a summoner can cast summon monster I as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Drawing on this ability uses up the same power that the summoner uses to call his eidolon. As a result, he can use this ability only when his eidolon is not summoned. He can cast this spell as a standard action, and the creatures remain for 1 minute per level (instead of 1 round per level). At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the power of this ability increases by 1 spell level, allowing him to summon more powerful creatures (to a maximum of summon monster IX at 17th level). At 19th level, this ability can be used as gate or summon monster IX. If used as gate, the summoner must pay any required material components. A summoner cannot have more than one summon monster or gate spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon monster or gate from this spell-like ability immediately ends. These summon spells are considered to be part of the summoner&#146;s spell list for the purposes of spell trigger and spell completion items. In addition, the summoner can expend uses of this ability to fulfill the construction requirements of any magic item he creates, so long as he can use this ability to cast the required spell.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, a storm caller and his eidolon can temporarily form an electrical current between them. The storm caller can expend a use of his summon storm&#146;s fury ability as a standard action to create an instantaneous line of lightning between him and his eidolon, provided that the eidolon is within 60 feet of him. The lightning arc deals the same amount of damage to all creatures in the line and has the same save DC as a bolt of lightning from the summon storm&#146;s fury ability (unlike call lightning, this damage is dealt only once). The storm caller and his eidolon are not affected by this lightning.</p>
					<p>At 12th level, the storm caller gains the benefit of his eidolon&#146;s resistance (electricity) or immunity (electricity) evolution whenever he is within 30 feet of the eidolon.</p>

If he does so, his eidolon is unable to take the flight evolution as long as the storm caller has that evolution.</p>
					<p>At 8th level, the storm caller&#146;s eidolon can have the flight evolution even if the storm caller has that evolution.</p>
					<p>At 10th level, the storm caller automatically gains the flight evolution without reducing the number of evolution points available to the eidolon. He can use the aspect ability (and at 18th level, the greater aspect ability) to gain additional evolutions.</p>

He cannot select any evolution that the eidolon could not possess, and he must be able to meet the requirements as well (except for subtype requirements, so long as his eidolon meets the subtype requirement). He cannot select the ability increase evolution through this ability. Any points spent in this way are taken from the eidolon&#146;s evolution pool (reducing the total number available to the eidolon).

					<p>At 14th level, the summoner&#146;s life becomes linked to his eidolon&#146;s. As long as the eidolon has 1 or more hit points, the summoner is protected from harm. Damage in excess of that which would reduce the summoner to 0 hit points is instead transferred to the eidolon. This damage is transferred 1 point at a time, meaning that as soon as the eidolon is reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to its Constitution score, all excess damage remains with the summoner. Effects that cause death but don&#146;t deal damage are unaffected by this ability. This ability does not affect spells such as baleful polymorph, flesh to stone, imprisonment, or other spells that don&#146;t deal damage.</p>

					<p>At 16th level, as a full-round action, a summoner can touch his eidolon and the two can merge forms. This transformation includes all of the summoner&#146;s gear. While merged in this way, the summoner is protected from harm and cannot be the target of spells or effects. All effects and spells currently targeting the summoner are suspended until the summoner emerges from the eidolon (although durations continue to expire).</p>
					<p>The summoner can cast spells while inside the eidolon by taking control of the eidolon for the duration of the casting. Any material components used for these spells are taken from the summoner&#146;s gear, even though they are otherwise inaccessible. The summoner can direct all of the eidolon&#146;s actions while merged, can perceive through its senses, and can speak through its voice.</p>
					<p>The summoner can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his summoner level. He can end this effect at any time as a swift action. The summoner emerges in a square adjacent to the eidolon if able. If the eidolon is returned to its home plane while the summoner is merged with it, the summoner is immediately ejected, takes 4d6 points of damage, and is stunned for 1 round.</p>

This ability functions as the aspect ability, but the maximum number of evolution points the summoner can divert increases to 6.

					<p>At 20th level, a summoner and his eidolon share a true connection. As a standard action, the summoner can assume the shape of his eidolon, copying all of its evolutions, form, and abilities. His Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores change to match the base scores of his eidolon. He can choose to have any gear that he carries become absorbed by his new form, as with spells from the polymorph subschool. Items with continuous effects continue to function while absorbed in this way. The summoner loses his natural attacks and all racial traits (except bonus feats, skills, and languages) in favor of the abilities granted by his eidolon&#146;s evolutions. The summoner retains all of his class features. The summoner can keep this form for a number of minutes per day equal to his summoner level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The summoner can end this effect as a free action.</p>

					<p>A storm caller can summon creatures infused with the power of the storm to help him. This functions as the summoner&#146;s summon monster I&#150;IX abilities, except the storm caller can summon only the following creatures at the indicated spell levels: I&#151;eagle; II&#151;small air elemental, small lightning elementalB2; III&#151;dire bat; IV&#151;medium air elemental, medium lightning elementalB2, pteranodon; V&#151;large air elemental, large lightning elementalB2; VI&#151;huge air elemental, huge lightning elementalB2; VII&#151;roc; VIII&#151;elder air elemental, elder lightning elementalB2; IX&#151;advanced elder air elemental, advanced elder lightning elementalB2. Any creatures summoned with this ability gain immunity to electricity.</p>
					<p>Alternatively, whenever his eidolon is not summoned, a storm caller can expend a daily use of this ability to summon a magical storm as a standard action. This functions as call lightning with a caster level equal to his summoner level, except as noted below.</p>
					<p>Each bolt of lightning deals 1d6 points of electricity damage. This damage increases by 1d6 at 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, to a maximum of 10d6 at 19th level. The prevailing weather has no effect on the damage of the lightning bolts. The Reflex save DC is equal to 10 + half the storm caller&#146;s summoner level + his Charisma modifier. If the storm caller uses this ability again before he has used all of his available bolts of lightning (to summon another magical storm, to summon a monster, or to use the gate spell), any unused bolts are expended with no effect.</p>
					<p>The storm caller adds call lightning to his summoner spell list as a 3rd-level spell and call lightning storm to automatically add them to his list of spells known.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Many summoners beckon monsters from the Elemental Planes, but few are as specialized as storm callers, who channel the elemental energies of the Plane of Air. Storm callers are most commonly encountered in areas where thunderstorms appear frequently, including supernaturally stormy places like the Sodden Lands.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>There are those who take a different path when pursuing the arcane arts, reaching across the boundaries of the world to the far-f lung planes to call forth all manner of creatures to do their bidding. Known as summoners, these arcane practitioners form close bonds with particular outsiders, known as eidolons, which increase in power along with their callers. In the end, summoners and their eidolons become linked, sharing shards of the same souls.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>Most of the summoner&#146;s class features are the same as those of the class&#146;s original design&#151;the biggest change comes to the eidolon. The unchained summoner selects a subtype for his eidolon (such as angel, demon, or protean), which determines a number of its evolutions and helps to shape the eidolon&#146;s general attitude and appearance. In addition, some of the evolutions are now tied to one or more subtypes and base forms, to make eidolons that better match the expected appearances and abilities of such creatures. Finally, the summoner spell list has been greatly revised, removing a number of imbalances.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>2d6 x 10 gp (average 70 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Summoner (Unchained)'s class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Summoners are proficient with all simple weapons and light armor. A summoner can cast summoner spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, a summoner wearing medium or heavy armor, or using a shield, incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component. A summoner still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells granted by other classes.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A summoner casts arcane spells drawn from the summoner spell list. (The unchained summoner&#146;s spell list is different from that presented in the Advanced Player&#146;s Guide.) He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a summoner must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a summoner&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the summoner&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>A summoner can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level each day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Summoner. In addition, he gains bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells on page 17 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A summoner&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A summoner begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the summoner&#146;s choice. At each new summoner level, he gains one or more new spells as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Summoner Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a summoner knows is not affected by his Charisma score. The numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.)</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third summoner level thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), a summoner can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the summoner &#147;loses&#148; the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level summoner spell the summoner can cast. A summoner can swap out only a single spell at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known.</p>
			<p>A summoner doesn&#146;t need to prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>A summoner learns a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots (due to metamagic feats, for example) consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Eidolon: </b>A summoner begins play with the ability to summon to his side a powerful outsider called an eidolon. The eidolon forms a link with the summoner, who forever after summons an aspect of the same creature. Each eidolon has a subtype, chosen when the eidolon is first summoned, that determines its origin and many of its abilities. An eidolon must be within one alignment step of the summoner who calls it (so a neutral good summoner can call a neutral, lawful good, or chaotic good eidolon) and can speak all of his languages. An eidolon is treated as a summoned creature, except it is not sent back to its home plane until reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to or greater than its Constitution score. In addition, due to its tie to its summoner, an eidolon can touch and attack creatures warded by protection from evil and similar effects that prevent contact with summoned creatures.</p>
			<p>A summoner can summon his eidolon in a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform. When summoned in this way, the eidolon&#146;s hit points are unchanged from the last time it was summoned. The only exception to this is if the eidolon was slain, in which case it returns with half its normal hit points. The eidolon does not heal naturally. The eidolon remains until dismissed by the summoner (a standard action). If the eidolon is sent back to its home plane due to death, it cannot be summoned again until the following day. The eidolon cannot be sent back to its home plane by means of dispel magic, but spells such as dismissal and banishment function normally. If the summoner is unconscious, asleep, or killed, his eidolon is immediately banished.</p>
			<p>The eidolon takes a form shaped by the summoner&#146;s desires. The eidolon&#146;s Hit Dice, saving throws, skills, feats, and abilities are tied to the summoner&#146;s class level and increase as the summoner gains levels. In addition, each eidolon gains a pool of evolution points based on the summoner&#146;s class level that can be used to give the eidolon different abilities and powers. Whenever the summoner gains a level, he must decide how these points are spent, and they are set until he gains another level of summoner.</p>
			<p>The eidolon&#146;s physical appearance is up to the summoner, but it always appears as some sort of fantastical creature appropriate to its subtype. This control is not fine enough to make the eidolon appear like a specific creature. The eidolon also bears a glowing rune that is identical to a rune that appears on the summoner&#146;s forehead as long as the eidolon is summoned. While this rune can be hidden through mundane means, it cannot be concealed through magic that changes appearance, such as alter self or polymorph (although invisibility does conceal it as long as the spell lasts).</p>
			<p><b>Life Link (Su): </b>At 1st level, a summoner forms a close bond with his eidolon. Whenever the eidolon takes enough damage to send it back to its home plane, as a reaction to the damage, the summoner can sacrifice any number of hit points he has without using an action. Each hit point sacrificed in this way prevents 1 point of damage dealt to the eidolon. This can prevent the eidolon from being sent back to its home plane.</p>
			<p>In addition, the eidolon and the summoner must remain within 100 feet of one another for the eidolon to remain at full strength. If the eidolon is beyond 100 feet but closer than 1,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 50%. If the eidolon is more than 1,000 feet away but closer than 10,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 75%. If the eidolon is more than 10,000 feet away, it is immediately returned to its home plane. Current hit points lost in this way are not restored when the eidolon gets closer to its summoner, but its maximum hit point total does climb to the levels indicated and eventually returns to normal.</p>
			<p><b>Summon Monster I (Sp): </b>At 1st level, a summoner can cast summon monster I as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Drawing on this ability uses up the same power that the summoner uses to call his eidolon. As a result, he can use this ability only when his eidolon is not summoned. He can cast this spell as a standard action, and the creatures remain for 1 minute per level (instead of 1 round per level). At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the power of this ability increases by 1 spell level, allowing him to summon more powerful creatures (to a maximum of summon monster IX at 17th level). At 19th level, this ability can be used as gate or summon monster IX. If used as gate, the summoner must pay any required material components. A summoner cannot have more than one summon monster or gate spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon monster or gate from this spell-like ability immediately ends. These summon spells are considered to be part of the summoner&#146;s spell list for the purposes of spell trigger and spell completion items. In addition, the summoner can expend uses of this ability to fulfill the construction requirements of any magic item he creates, so long as he can use this ability to cast the required spell.</p>
			<p><b>Stormy Eidolon: </b>A storm caller must select an eidolon subtype that gains resistance or immunity to electricity at 1st level, such as the elemental eidolon (Pathfinder Unchained 33) or genie eidolon (see page 27).If the eidolon has neither of these evolutions, it becomes nauseated until it regains one of them.</p>
			<p>This ability alters eidolon.</p>
			<p><b>Summon Storm&#146;s Fury (Sp): </b>A storm caller can summon creatures infused with the power of the storm to help him. This functions as the summoner&#146;s summon monster I&#150;IX abilities, except the storm caller can summon only the following creatures at the indicated spell levels: I&#151;eagle; II&#151;small air elemental, small lightning elementalB2; III&#151;dire bat; IV&#151;medium air elemental, medium lightning elementalB2, pteranodon; V&#151;large air elemental, large lightning elementalB2; VI&#151;huge air elemental, huge lightning elementalB2; VII&#151;roc; VIII&#151;elder air elemental, elder lightning elementalB2; IX&#151;advanced elder air elemental, advanced elder lightning elementalB2. Any creatures summoned with this ability gain immunity to electricity.</p>
			<p>Alternatively, whenever his eidolon is not summoned, a storm caller can expend a daily use of this ability to summon a magical storm as a standard action. This functions as call lightning with a caster level equal to his summoner level, except as noted below.</p>
			<p>Each bolt of lightning deals 1d6 points of electricity damage. This damage increases by 1d6 at 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, to a maximum of 10d6 at 19th level. The prevailing weather has no effect on the damage of the lightning bolts. The Reflex save DC is equal to 10 + half the storm caller&#146;s summoner level + his Charisma modifier. If the storm caller uses this ability again before he has used all of his available bolts of lightning (to summon another magical storm, to summon a monster, or to use the gate spell), any unused bolts are expended with no effect.</p>
			<p>The storm caller adds call lightning to his summoner spell list as a 3rd-level spell and call lightning storm to automatically add them to his list of spells known.</p>
			<p>This alters the summoner&#146;s summon monster I&#150;IX abilities.</p>
			<p><b>Bond Senses (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a summoner can, as a standard action, share the senses of his eidolon, hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and touching everything the eidolon does. He can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to his summoner level. There is no maximum range to this effect, but the eidolon and the summoner must be on the same plane. The summoner can end this effect as a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Electrical Polarity (Su): </b>At 4th level, a storm caller and his eidolon can temporarily form an electrical current between them. The storm caller can expend a use of his summon storm&#146;s fury ability as a standard action to create an instantaneous line of lightning between him and his eidolon, provided that the eidolon is within 60 feet of him. The lightning arc deals the same amount of damage to all creatures in the line and has the same save DC as a bolt of lightning from the summon storm&#146;s fury ability (unlike call lightning, this damage is dealt only once). The storm caller and his eidolon are not affected by this lightning.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, the storm caller gains the benefit of his eidolon&#146;s resistance (electricity) or immunity (electricity) evolution whenever he is within 30 feet of the eidolon.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces shield ally and greater shield ally.</p>
			<p><b>Storm&#146;s Wings (Su): </b>At 6th level, a storm caller can borrow some of his eidolon&#146;s elemental might. He can gain the flight evolution (Pathfinder Unchained 37) as though he were using the summoner&#146;s aspect ability, deducting 2 evolution points from the eidolon&#146;s evolution pool. If he does so, his eidolon is unable to take the flight evolution as long as the storm caller has that evolution.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the storm caller&#146;s eidolon can have the flight evolution even if the storm caller has that evolution.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, the storm caller automatically gains the flight evolution without reducing the number of evolution points available to the eidolon. He can use the aspect ability (and at 18th level, the greater aspect ability) to gain additional evolutions.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces maker&#146;s call and transposition.</p>
			<p><b>Aspect (Su): </b>At 10th level, a summoner can divert up to 2 points from his eidolon&#146;s evolution pool to add evolutions to himself. He cannot select any evolution that the eidolon could not possess, and he must be able to meet the requirements as well (except for subtype requirements, so long as his eidolon meets the subtype requirement). He cannot select the ability increase evolution through this ability. Any points spent in this way are taken from the eidolon&#146;s evolution pool (reducing the total number available to the eidolon). The summoner can change the evolutions granted by these points anytime he can change the eidolon&#146;s evolutions.</p>
			<p><b>Life Bond (Su): </b>At 14th level, the summoner&#146;s life becomes linked to his eidolon&#146;s. As long as the eidolon has 1 or more hit points, the summoner is protected from harm. Damage in excess of that which would reduce the summoner to 0 hit points is instead transferred to the eidolon. This damage is transferred 1 point at a time, meaning that as soon as the eidolon is reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to its Constitution score, all excess damage remains with the summoner. Effects that cause death but don&#146;t deal damage are unaffected by this ability. This ability does not affect spells such as baleful polymorph, flesh to stone, imprisonment, or other spells that don&#146;t deal damage.</p>
			<p><b>Merge Forms (Su): </b>At 16th level, as a full-round action, a summoner can touch his eidolon and the two can merge forms. This transformation includes all of the summoner&#146;s gear. While merged in this way, the summoner is protected from harm and cannot be the target of spells or effects. All effects and spells currently targeting the summoner are suspended until the summoner emerges from the eidolon (although durations continue to expire).</p>
			<p>The summoner can cast spells while inside the eidolon by taking control of the eidolon for the duration of the casting. Any material components used for these spells are taken from the summoner&#146;s gear, even though they are otherwise inaccessible. The summoner can direct all of the eidolon&#146;s actions while merged, can perceive through its senses, and can speak through its voice.</p>
			<p>The summoner can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his summoner level. He can end this effect at any time as a swift action. The summoner emerges in a square adjacent to the eidolon if able. If the eidolon is returned to its home plane while the summoner is merged with it, the summoner is immediately ejected, takes 4d6 points of damage, and is stunned for 1 round.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Aspect (Su): </b>At 18th level, a summoner can divert more of his eidolon&#146;s evolutions to himself. This ability functions as the aspect ability, but the maximum number of evolution points the summoner can divert increases to 6. In addition, the eidolon loses 1 point from its evolution pool for every 2 points (or fraction thereof ) diverted to the summoner instead of losing 1 point from the evolution pool for each point diverted.</p>
			<p><b>Twin Eidolon (Su) </b>: At 20th level, a summoner and his eidolon share a true connection. As a standard action, the summoner can assume the shape of his eidolon, copying all of its evolutions, form, and abilities. His Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores change to match the base scores of his eidolon. He can choose to have any gear that he carries become absorbed by his new form, as with spells from the polymorph subschool. Items with continuous effects continue to function while absorbed in this way. The summoner loses his natural attacks and all racial traits (except bonus feats, skills, and languages) in favor of the abilities granted by his eidolon&#146;s evolutions. The summoner retains all of his class features. The summoner can keep this form for a number of minutes per day equal to his summoner level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The summoner can end this effect as a free action.</p>

While merged in this way, the summoner is protected from harm and cannot be the target of spells or effects. All effects and spells currently targeting the summoner are suspended until the summoner emerges from the eidolon (although durations continue to expire).</p>
					<p>The summoner can cast spells while inside the eidolon by taking control of the eidolon for the duration of the casting. Any material components used for these spells are taken from the summoner&#146;s gear, even though they are otherwise inaccessible. The summoner can direct all of the eidolon&#146;s actions while merged, can perceive through its senses, and can speak through its voice.</p>
					<p>The summoner can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his summoner level. He can end this effect at any time as a swift action. The summoner emerges in a square adjacent to the eidolon if able. If the eidolon is returned to its home plane while the summoner is merged with it, the summoner is immediately ejected, takes 4d6 points of damage, and is stunned for 1 round.</p>

					<p>At 18th level, a summoner can divert more of his eidolon&#146;s evolutions to himself. This ability functions as the aspect ability, but the maximum number of evolution points the summoner can divert increases to 6. In addition, the eidolon loses 1 point from its evolution pool for every 2 points (or fraction thereof ) diverted to the summoner instead of losing 1 point from the evolution pool for each point diverted.</p>

					<p>At 20th level, a summoner and his eidolon share a true connection. As a standard action, the summoner can assume the shape of his eidolon, copying all of its evolutions, form, and abilities. His Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores change to match the base scores of his eidolon. He can choose to have any gear that he carries become absorbed by his new form, as with spells from the polymorph subschool. Items with continuous effects continue to function while absorbed in this way. The summoner loses his natural attacks and all racial traits (except bonus feats, skills, and languages) in favor of the abilities granted by his eidolon&#146;s evolutions. The summoner retains all of his class features. The summoner can keep this form for a number of minutes per day equal to his summoner level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The summoner can end this effect as a free action.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A soulbound summoner&#146;s metaphysical connection with his eidolon has profound effects on both of them. The eidolon&#146;s alignment always matches that of the soulbound summoner, regardless of its subtype. In addition, at 1st level, the summoner must choose an oracle curse, using his summoner level as his oracle level for determining the curse&#146;s effects. Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. A summoner that gains spells for his list of spells known as a result of his curse must be able to cast spells of the appropriate level in order to cast the learned spell.</p>
					<p>The glowing rune that the soulbound summoner shares with his eidolon always appears on a place symbolic of his pactbond curse. For example, a summoner who chooses the clouded vision curse might have his summoner&#146;s rune manifest on one of his eyes, while a summoner who chooses the tongues curse might have his summoner&#146;s rune appear on his lips. A soulbound summoner&#146;s eidolon is summoned from his own psyche rather than a different plane, so spells such as banishment and dismissal do not work when cast on the eidolon.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Not everyone who becomes a summoner is an intentional dabbler in the arcane arts. Soulbound summoners, as a rule, never set out to bind their soul to a dangerous and enigmatic power. Rather, they have found themselves unintentional masters of eidolons through incredible circumstances. Most common are those who forged their pacts with an outsider out of a mutual desire for self-preservation. Other soulbound summoners never contacted a true outsider at all, instead manifesting an eidolon from their minds in response to mental or magical trauma. The events that create such a summoner result in the eidolon fusing entirely to the summoner&#146;s psyche. These accidental summoners lack the practiced skill at reaching across planes that most summoners have, but their intense bond with their eidolon grants both summoner and outsider unusual power.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>There are those who take a different path when pursuing the arcane arts, reaching across the boundaries of the world to the far-f lung planes to call forth all manner of creatures to do their bidding. Known as summoners, these arcane practitioners form close bonds with particular outsiders, known as eidolons, which increase in power along with their callers. In the end, summoners and their eidolons become linked, sharing shards of the same souls.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>Most of the summoner&#146;s class features are the same as those of the class&#146;s original design&#151;the biggest change comes to the eidolon. The unchained summoner selects a subtype for his eidolon (such as angel, demon, or protean), which determines a number of its evolutions and helps to shape the eidolon&#146;s general attitude and appearance. In addition, some of the evolutions are now tied to one or more subtypes and base forms, to make eidolons that better match the expected appearances and abilities of such creatures. Finally, the summoner spell list has been greatly revised, removing a number of imbalances.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>2d6 x 10 gp (average 70 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Summoner (Unchained)'s class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Summoners are proficient with all simple weapons and light armor. A summoner can cast summoner spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, a summoner wearing medium or heavy armor, or using a shield, incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component. A summoner still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells granted by other classes.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A summoner casts arcane spells drawn from the summoner spell list. (The unchained summoner&#146;s spell list is different from that presented in the Advanced Player&#146;s Guide.) He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a summoner must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a summoner&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the summoner&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>A summoner can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level each day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Summoner. In addition, he gains bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells on page 17 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A summoner&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A summoner begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the summoner&#146;s choice. At each new summoner level, he gains one or more new spells as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Summoner Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a summoner knows is not affected by his Charisma score. The numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.)</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third summoner level thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), a summoner can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the summoner &#147;loses&#148; the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level summoner spell the summoner can cast. A summoner can swap out only a single spell at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known.</p>
			<p>A summoner doesn&#146;t need to prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>A summoner learns a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots (due to metamagic feats, for example) consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Eidolon: </b>A summoner begins play with the ability to summon to his side a powerful outsider called an eidolon. The eidolon forms a link with the summoner, who forever after summons an aspect of the same creature. Each eidolon has a subtype, chosen when the eidolon is first summoned, that determines its origin and many of its abilities. An eidolon must be within one alignment step of the summoner who calls it (so a neutral good summoner can call a neutral, lawful good, or chaotic good eidolon) and can speak all of his languages. An eidolon is treated as a summoned creature, except it is not sent back to its home plane until reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to or greater than its Constitution score. In addition, due to its tie to its summoner, an eidolon can touch and attack creatures warded by protection from evil and similar effects that prevent contact with summoned creatures.</p>
			<p>A summoner can summon his eidolon in a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform. When summoned in this way, the eidolon&#146;s hit points are unchanged from the last time it was summoned. The only exception to this is if the eidolon was slain, in which case it returns with half its normal hit points. The eidolon does not heal naturally. The eidolon remains until dismissed by the summoner (a standard action). If the eidolon is sent back to its home plane due to death, it cannot be summoned again until the following day. The eidolon cannot be sent back to its home plane by means of dispel magic, but spells such as dismissal and banishment function normally. If the summoner is unconscious, asleep, or killed, his eidolon is immediately banished.</p>
			<p>The eidolon takes a form shaped by the summoner&#146;s desires. The eidolon&#146;s Hit Dice, saving throws, skills, feats, and abilities are tied to the summoner&#146;s class level and increase as the summoner gains levels. In addition, each eidolon gains a pool of evolution points based on the summoner&#146;s class level that can be used to give the eidolon different abilities and powers. Whenever the summoner gains a level, he must decide how these points are spent, and they are set until he gains another level of summoner.</p>
			<p>The eidolon&#146;s physical appearance is up to the summoner, but it always appears as some sort of fantastical creature appropriate to its subtype. This control is not fine enough to make the eidolon appear like a specific creature. The eidolon also bears a glowing rune that is identical to a rune that appears on the summoner&#146;s forehead as long as the eidolon is summoned. While this rune can be hidden through mundane means, it cannot be concealed through magic that changes appearance, such as alter self or polymorph (although invisibility does conceal it as long as the spell lasts).</p>
			<p><b>Pactbond Curse (Ex): </b>A soulbound summoner&#146;s metaphysical connection with his eidolon has profound effects on both of them. The eidolon&#146;s alignment always matches that of the soulbound summoner, regardless of its subtype. In addition, at 1st level, the summoner must choose an oracle curse, using his summoner level as his oracle level for determining the curse&#146;s effects. Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. A summoner that gains spells for his list of spells known as a result of his curse must be able to cast spells of the appropriate level in order to cast the learned spell.</p>
			<p>The glowing rune that the soulbound summoner shares with his eidolon always appears on a place symbolic of his pactbond curse. For example, a summoner who chooses the clouded vision curse might have his summoner&#146;s rune manifest on one of his eyes, while a summoner who chooses the tongues curse might have his summoner&#146;s rune appear on his lips. A soulbound summoner&#146;s eidolon is summoned from his own psyche rather than a different plane, so spells such as banishment and dismissal do not work when cast on the eidolon.</p>
			<p>This alters the eidolon class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Life Link (Su): </b>At 1st level, a summoner forms a close bond with his eidolon. Whenever the eidolon takes enough damage to send it back to its home plane, as a reaction to the damage, the summoner can sacrifice any number of hit points he has without using an action. Each hit point sacrificed in this way prevents 1 point of damage dealt to the eidolon. This can prevent the eidolon from being sent back to its home plane.</p>
			<p>In addition, the eidolon and the summoner must remain within 100 feet of one another for the eidolon to remain at full strength. If the eidolon is beyond 100 feet but closer than 1,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 50%. If the eidolon is more than 1,000 feet away but closer than 10,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 75%. If the eidolon is more than 10,000 feet away, it is immediately returned to its home plane. Current hit points lost in this way are not restored when the eidolon gets closer to its summoner, but its maximum hit point total does climb to the levels indicated and eventually returns to normal.</p>
			<p><b>Soulbound Life Link (Su): </b>The essence of a soulbound summoner&#146;s eidolon resides within the summoner&#146;s mind and soul instead of a home plane, and he can use this connection to restore his eidolon with his own vitality. The summoner can use his life link ability to sacrifice any number of his hit points without using an action. Each hit point sacrificed in this way heals the eidolon for 1 point of damage. The soulbound summoner can use this ability even after the eidolon has been killed and sent back to its summoner&#146;s mind; if the eidolon is healed enough that its hit point total is above 0, it can be summoned again as normal.</p>
			<p>This alters life link.</p>
			<p><b>Weakened Summoning: </b>A soulbound summoner&#146;s eidolon is usually the result of unintended magic, trauma, or a singular pact, instead of rigorous arcane study. Soulbound summoners do not gain the ability to cast the summon monster or gate spells as a spell-like ability.</p>
			<p><b>Bond Senses (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a summoner can, as a standard action, share the senses of his eidolon, hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and touching everything the eidolon does. He can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to his summoner level. There is no maximum range to this effect, but the eidolon and the summoner must be on the same plane. The summoner can end this effect as a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Soulbound Evolution: </b>A soulbound summoner&#146;s eidolon gains power from its unusually strong bond with its summoner. At 3rd level, and again at 5th, 7th, and 9th level, the eidolon adds 1 point to its evolution pool. At 11th level, and again at 15th, 17th, and 19th level, the eidolon adds 2 points to its evolution pool. At 7th level, the eidolon can select evolutions even if it does not meet the subtype requirements for that evolution.</p>
			<p>At 13th level, the eidolon can draw from its summoner&#146;s power to cast spells. The spell must be a spell that the summoner knows, and the summoner must expend two spell slots of the same spell level or higher to allow the eidolon to cast the spell. Expending spell slots in this way does not take an action. The eidolon uses the summoner&#146;s caster level, feats, and casting statistics for all spellcasting purposes. The eidolon must be able to meet all other requirements for casting the spell, such as being able to speak for spells requiring verbal components and providing any material components or focuses for spells that require them. The eidolon must be able to move its body to cast spells with somatic components, but it does not need to have the limbs (arms) evolution.</p>
			<p><b>Shield Ally (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a summoner is within his eidolon&#146;s reach, the summoner gains a +2 shield bonus to his Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on his saving throws. This bonus does not apply if the eidolon is grappled, helpless, paralyzed, stunned, or unconscious.</p>
			<p><b>Maker&#146;s Call (Su): </b>At 6th level, as a standard action, a summoner can call his eidolon to his side. This functions as dimension door, using the summoner&#146;s caster level. When this ability is used, the eidolon appears adjacent to the summoner (or as close as possible if all adjacent spaces are occupied). If the eidolon is out of range, the ability is wasted. The summoner can use this ability once per day at 6th level, plus one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 6th.</p>
			<p><b>Transposition (Su): </b>At 8th level, a summoner can use his maker&#146;s call ability to swap locations with his eidolon. If the eidolon occupies more squares than the summoner, the summoner can appear in any square occupied by the eidolon. The eidolon must occupy the square that was occupied by the summoner if able, or as close as possible if it is not able.</p>
			<p><b>Aspect (Su): </b>At 10th level, a summoner can divert up to 2 points from his eidolon&#146;s evolution pool to add evolutions to himself. He cannot select any evolution that the eidolon could not possess, and he must be able to meet the requirements as well (except for subtype requirements, so long as his eidolon meets the subtype requirement). He cannot select the ability increase evolution through this ability. Any points spent in this way are taken from the eidolon&#146;s evolution pool (reducing the total number available to the eidolon). The summoner can change the evolutions granted by these points anytime he can change the eidolon&#146;s evolutions.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Shield Ally (Su): </b>At 12th level, whenever an ally is within reach of the summoner&#146;s eidolon, the ally gains a +2 shield bonus to its Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on its saving throws. If this ally is the summoner, these bonuses increase to +4. This bonus does not apply if the eidolon is grappled, helpless, paralyzed, stunned, or unconscious.</p>
			<p><b>Life Bond (Su): </b>At 14th level, the summoner&#146;s life becomes linked to his eidolon&#146;s. As long as the eidolon has 1 or more hit points, the summoner is protected from harm. Damage in excess of that which would reduce the summoner to 0 hit points is instead transferred to the eidolon. This damage is transferred 1 point at a time, meaning that as soon as the eidolon is reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to its Constitution score, all excess damage remains with the summoner. Effects that cause death but don&#146;t deal damage are unaffected by this ability. This ability does not affect spells such as baleful polymorph, flesh to stone, imprisonment, or other spells that don&#146;t deal damage.</p>
			<p><b>Merge Forms (Su): </b>At 16th level, as a full-round action, a summoner can touch his eidolon and the two can merge forms. This transformation includes all of the summoner&#146;s gear. While merged in this way, the summoner is protected from harm and cannot be the target of spells or effects. All effects and spells currently targeting the summoner are suspended until the summoner emerges from the eidolon (although durations continue to expire).</p>
			<p>The summoner can cast spells while inside the eidolon by taking control of the eidolon for the duration of the casting. Any material components used for these spells are taken from the summoner&#146;s gear, even though they are otherwise inaccessible. The summoner can direct all of the eidolon&#146;s actions while merged, can perceive through its senses, and can speak through its voice.</p>
			<p>The summoner can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his summoner level. He can end this effect at any time as a swift action. The summoner emerges in a square adjacent to the eidolon if able. If the eidolon is returned to its home plane while the summoner is merged with it, the summoner is immediately ejected, takes 4d6 points of damage, and is stunned for 1 round.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Aspect (Su): </b>At 18th level, a summoner can divert more of his eidolon&#146;s evolutions to himself. This ability functions as the aspect ability, but the maximum number of evolution points the summoner can divert increases to 6. In addition, the eidolon loses 1 point from its evolution pool for every 2 points (or fraction thereof ) diverted to the summoner instead of losing 1 point from the evolution pool for each point diverted.</p>
			<p><b>Twin Eidolon (Su) </b>: At 20th level, a summoner and his eidolon share a true connection. As a standard action, the summoner can assume the shape of his eidolon, copying all of its evolutions, form, and abilities. His Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores change to match the base scores of his eidolon. He can choose to have any gear that he carries become absorbed by his new form, as with spells from the polymorph subschool. Items with continuous effects continue to function while absorbed in this way. The summoner loses his natural attacks and all racial traits (except bonus feats, skills, and languages) in favor of the abilities granted by his eidolon&#146;s evolutions. The summoner retains all of his class features. The summoner can keep this form for a number of minutes per day equal to his summoner level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The summoner can end this effect as a free action.</p>

					<p>Summoners are proficient with all simple weapons and light armor. A summoner can cast summoner spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, a summoner wearing medium or heavy armor, or using a shield, incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component. A summoner still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells granted by other classes.</p>

					<p>A summoner casts arcane spells drawn from the summoner spell list. (The unchained summoner&#146;s spell list is different from that presented in the Advanced Player&#146;s Guide.) He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time.</p>
					<p>To learn or cast a spell, a summoner must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a summoner&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the summoner&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>A summoner can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level each day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Summoner. In addition, he gains bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells on page 17 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>A summoner&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A summoner begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the summoner&#146;s choice. At each new summoner level, he gains one or more new spells as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Summoner Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a summoner knows is not affected by his Charisma score. The numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.)</p>
					<p>Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third summoner level thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), a summoner can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the summoner &#147;loses&#148; the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level summoner spell the summoner can cast. A summoner can swap out only a single spell at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known.</p>
					<p>A summoner doesn&#146;t need to prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the level.</p>

				<name type="string">Eidolon</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A summoner begins play with the ability to summon to his side a powerful outsider called an eidolon. The eidolon forms a link with the summoner, who forever after summons an aspect of the same creature. Each eidolon has a subtype, chosen when the eidolon is first summoned, that determines its origin and many of its abilities. An eidolon must be within one alignment step of the summoner who calls it (so a neutral good summoner can call a neutral, lawful good, or chaotic good eidolon) and can speak all of his languages. An eidolon is treated as a summoned creature, except it is not sent back to its home plane until reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to or greater than its Constitution score. In addition, due to its tie to its summoner, an eidolon can touch and attack creatures warded by protection from evil and similar effects that prevent contact with summoned creatures.</p>
					<p>A summoner can summon his eidolon in a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform. When summoned in this way, the eidolon&#146;s hit points are unchanged from the last time it was summoned. The only exception to this is if the eidolon was slain, in which case it returns with half its normal hit points. The eidolon does not heal naturally. The eidolon remains until dismissed by the summoner (a standard action). If the eidolon is sent back to its home plane due to death, it cannot be summoned again until the following day. The eidolon cannot be sent back to its home plane by means of dispel magic, but spells such as dismissal and banishment function normally. If the summoner is unconscious, asleep, or killed, his eidolon is immediately banished.</p>
					<p>The eidolon takes a form shaped by the summoner&#146;s desires. The eidolon&#146;s Hit Dice, saving throws, skills, feats, and abilities are tied to the summoner&#146;s class level and increase as the summoner gains levels. In addition, each eidolon gains a pool of evolution points based on the summoner&#146;s class level that can be used to give the eidolon different abilities and powers. Whenever the summoner gains a level, he must decide how these points are spent, and they are set until he gains another level of summoner.</p>
					<p>The eidolon&#146;s physical appearance is up to the summoner, but it always appears as some sort of fantastical creature appropriate to its subtype. This control is not fine enough to make the eidolon appear like a specific creature. The eidolon also bears a glowing rune that is identical to a rune that appears on the summoner&#146;s forehead as long as the eidolon is summoned. While this rune can be hidden through mundane means, it cannot be concealed through magic that changes appearance, such as alter self or polymorph (although invisibility does conceal it as long as the spell lasts).</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a summoner forms a close bond with his eidolon. Whenever the eidolon takes enough damage to send it back to its home plane, as a reaction to the damage, the summoner can sacrifice any number of hit points he has without using an action. Each hit point sacrificed in this way prevents 1 point of damage dealt to the eidolon. This can prevent the eidolon from being sent back to its home plane.</p>
					<p>In addition, the eidolon and the summoner must remain within 100 feet of one another for the eidolon to remain at full strength. If the eidolon is beyond 100 feet but closer than 1,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 50%. If the eidolon is more than 1,000 feet away but closer than 10,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 75%. If the eidolon is more than 10,000 feet away, it is immediately returned to its home plane. Current hit points lost in this way are not restored when the eidolon gets closer to its summoner, but its maximum hit point total does climb to the levels indicated and eventually returns to normal.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A leshy caller summons creatures from the First World and forges a bond with a leshy eidolon.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>There are those who take a different path when pursuing the arcane arts, reaching across the boundaries of the world to the far-f lung planes to call forth all manner of creatures to do their bidding. Known as summoners, these arcane practitioners form close bonds with particular outsiders, known as eidolons, which increase in power along with their callers. In the end, summoners and their eidolons become linked, sharing shards of the same souls.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>Most of the summoner&#146;s class features are the same as those of the class&#146;s original design&#151;the biggest change comes to the eidolon. The unchained summoner selects a subtype for his eidolon (such as angel, demon, or protean), which determines a number of its evolutions and helps to shape the eidolon&#146;s general attitude and appearance. In addition, some of the evolutions are now tied to one or more subtypes and base forms, to make eidolons that better match the expected appearances and abilities of such creatures. Finally, the summoner spell list has been greatly revised, removing a number of imbalances.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>2d6 x 10 gp (average 70 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Summoner (Unchained)'s class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Summoners are proficient with all simple weapons and light armor. A summoner can cast summoner spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, a summoner wearing medium or heavy armor, or using a shield, incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component. A summoner still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells granted by other classes.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A summoner casts arcane spells drawn from the summoner spell list. (The unchained summoner&#146;s spell list is different from that presented in the Advanced Player&#146;s Guide.) He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a summoner must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a summoner&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the summoner&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>A summoner can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level each day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Summoner. In addition, he gains bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells on page 17 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A summoner&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A summoner begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the summoner&#146;s choice. At each new summoner level, he gains one or more new spells as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Summoner Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a summoner knows is not affected by his Charisma score. The numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.)</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third summoner level thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), a summoner can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the summoner &#147;loses&#148; the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level summoner spell the summoner can cast. A summoner can swap out only a single spell at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known.</p>
			<p>A summoner doesn&#146;t need to prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>A summoner learns a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots (due to metamagic feats, for example) consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Eidolon: </b>A summoner begins play with the ability to summon to his side a powerful outsider called an eidolon. The eidolon forms a link with the summoner, who forever after summons an aspect of the same creature. Each eidolon has a subtype, chosen when the eidolon is first summoned, that determines its origin and many of its abilities. An eidolon must be within one alignment step of the summoner who calls it (so a neutral good summoner can call a neutral, lawful good, or chaotic good eidolon) and can speak all of his languages. An eidolon is treated as a summoned creature, except it is not sent back to its home plane until reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to or greater than its Constitution score. In addition, due to its tie to its summoner, an eidolon can touch and attack creatures warded by protection from evil and similar effects that prevent contact with summoned creatures.</p>
			<p>A summoner can summon his eidolon in a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform. When summoned in this way, the eidolon&#146;s hit points are unchanged from the last time it was summoned. The only exception to this is if the eidolon was slain, in which case it returns with half its normal hit points. The eidolon does not heal naturally. The eidolon remains until dismissed by the summoner (a standard action). If the eidolon is sent back to its home plane due to death, it cannot be summoned again until the following day. The eidolon cannot be sent back to its home plane by means of dispel magic, but spells such as dismissal and banishment function normally. If the summoner is unconscious, asleep, or killed, his eidolon is immediately banished.</p>
			<p>The eidolon takes a form shaped by the summoner&#146;s desires. The eidolon&#146;s Hit Dice, saving throws, skills, feats, and abilities are tied to the summoner&#146;s class level and increase as the summoner gains levels. In addition, each eidolon gains a pool of evolution points based on the summoner&#146;s class level that can be used to give the eidolon different abilities and powers. Whenever the summoner gains a level, he must decide how these points are spent, and they are set until he gains another level of summoner.</p>
			<p>The eidolon&#146;s physical appearance is up to the summoner, but it always appears as some sort of fantastical creature appropriate to its subtype. This control is not fine enough to make the eidolon appear like a specific creature. The eidolon also bears a glowing rune that is identical to a rune that appears on the summoner&#146;s forehead as long as the eidolon is summoned. While this rune can be hidden through mundane means, it cannot be concealed through magic that changes appearance, such as alter self or polymorph (although invisibility does conceal it as long as the spell lasts).</p>
			<p><b>Leshy Eidolon: </b>When a leshy caller summons her eidolon, the eidolon&#146;s body is created from extraplanar plant material and imbued with the intelligence of a leshy spirit. Its statistics are changed from those of a standard eidolon as follows. An unchained summoner uses the plant eidolon subtype instead of one of the subtypes listed in Pathfinder RPG Pathfinder Unchained.</p>
			<p><i>Type: </i>The eidolon is still an outsider, and its statistics don&#146;t change, but it also counts as a plant. As it isn&#146;t truly a plant, it doesn&#146;t gain the plant immunities.</p>
			<p><i>Base Form: </i>The leshy caller chooses one of the base forms listed below for her eidolon. When the eidolon is summoned in an environment matching one of these base forms, the leshy caller can change the eidolon&#146;s base form to the matching form by sacrificing one daily use of her summon nature&#146;s ally ability as a free action.</p>
			<p>Plant eidolon base forms are as follows.</p>
			<p><i>Cactus (Desert): </i>Size Medium; Speed 30 ft.; AC +2 natural armor; Saves Fort (good), Ref (good), Will (bad); Attack sting (1d4); Ability Scores Str 14, Dex 14, Con 13, Int 7, Wis 10, Cha 11; Free Evolutions limbs (arms), limbs (legs), sting.</p>
			<p><i>Conifer (Forest, Mountain): </i>Size Medium; Speed 30 ft.; AC +2 natural armor; Saves Fort (good), Ref (bad), Will (good); Attack 2 claws (1d4); Ability Scores Str 14, Dex 12, Con 15, Int 7, Wis 10, Cha 11; Free Evolutions claws, limbs (arms), limbs (legs).</p>
			<p><i>Fungus (Swamp, Underground): </i>Size Medium; Speed 30 ft.; AC +2 natural armor; Saves Fort (good), Ref (good), Will (bad); Attack bite (1d6); Ability Scores Str 14, Dex 14, Con 13, Int 7, Wis 10, Cha 11; Free Evolutions bite, limbs (arms), limbs (legs).</p>
			<p><i>Leaf (Forest, Jungle, Swamp): </i>Size Medium; Speed 30 ft.; AC +2 natural armor; Saves Fort (good), Ref (good), Will (bad); Attack slam (1d8); Ability Scores Str 16, Dex 12, Con 13, Int 7, Wis 10, Cha 11; Free Evolutions limbs (arms), limbs (legs), slam.</p>
			<p><i>Seaweed (Aquatic): </i>Size Medium; Speed 20 ft., swim 40 ft.; AC +2 natural armor; Saves Fort (good), Ref (good), Will (bad); Attack slam (1d8); Ability Scores Str 12, Dex 14, Con 15, Int 7, Wis 10, Cha 11; Free Evolutions limbs (arms), slam, swim (2).</p>
			<p>This alters the summoner&#146;s eidolon.</p>
			<p><b>Life Link (Su): </b>At 1st level, a summoner forms a close bond with his eidolon. Whenever the eidolon takes enough damage to send it back to its home plane, as a reaction to the damage, the summoner can sacrifice any number of hit points he has without using an action. Each hit point sacrificed in this way prevents 1 point of damage dealt to the eidolon. This can prevent the eidolon from being sent back to its home plane.</p>
			<p>In addition, the eidolon and the summoner must remain within 100 feet of one another for the eidolon to remain at full strength. If the eidolon is beyond 100 feet but closer than 1,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 50%. If the eidolon is more than 1,000 feet away but closer than 10,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 75%. If the eidolon is more than 10,000 feet away, it is immediately returned to its home plane. Current hit points lost in this way are not restored when the eidolon gets closer to its summoner, but its maximum hit point total does climb to the levels indicated and eventually returns to normal.</p>
			<p><b>Summon Nature&#146;s Ally (Sp): </b>A leshy caller can cast summon nature&#146;s ally as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. At levels where a regular summoner would gain access to a new level of summon monster as a spell-like ability, the leshy caller instead gains the equivalent summon nature&#146;s ally spell; at 19th level, she can cast summon nature&#146;s ally IX or gate. When a leshy caller gains a summon nature&#146;s ally spell as a spell-like ability, she adds it to her class spell list (though she must still select it as a spell known if she wants to gain the ability to cast it as a normal spell). She adds leaf leshys, gourd leshys, fungus leshys, seaweed leshys, and lotus leshys to her list of creatures for summon nature&#146;s ally I, II, III, IV, and V, respectively.</p>
			<p>This alters summon monster.</p>
			<p><b>Bond Senses (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a summoner can, as a standard action, share the senses of his eidolon, hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and touching everything the eidolon does. He can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to his summoner level. There is no maximum range to this effect, but the eidolon and the summoner must be on the same plane. The summoner can end this effect as a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Shield Ally (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a summoner is within his eidolon&#146;s reach, the summoner gains a +2 shield bonus to his Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on his saving throws. This bonus does not apply if the eidolon is grappled, helpless, paralyzed, stunned, or unconscious.</p>
			<p><b>Maker&#146;s Call (Su): </b>At 6th level, as a standard action, a summoner can call his eidolon to his side. This functions as dimension door, using the summoner&#146;s caster level. When this ability is used, the eidolon appears adjacent to the summoner (or as close as possible if all adjacent spaces are occupied). If the eidolon is out of range, the ability is wasted. The summoner can use this ability once per day at 6th level, plus one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 6th.</p>
			<p><b>Transposition (Su): </b>At 8th level, a summoner can use his maker&#146;s call ability to swap locations with his eidolon. If the eidolon occupies more squares than the summoner, the summoner can appear in any square occupied by the eidolon. The eidolon must occupy the square that was occupied by the summoner if able, or as close as possible if it is not able.</p>
			<p><b>Aspect (Su): </b>At 10th level, a summoner can divert up to 2 points from his eidolon&#146;s evolution pool to add evolutions to himself. He cannot select any evolution that the eidolon could not possess, and he must be able to meet the requirements as well (except for subtype requirements, so long as his eidolon meets the subtype requirement). He cannot select the ability increase evolution through this ability. Any points spent in this way are taken from the eidolon&#146;s evolution pool (reducing the total number available to the eidolon). The summoner can change the evolutions granted by these points anytime he can change the eidolon&#146;s evolutions.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Shield Ally (Su): </b>At 12th level, whenever an ally is within reach of the summoner&#146;s eidolon, the ally gains a +2 shield bonus to its Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on its saving throws. If this ally is the summoner, these bonuses increase to +4. This bonus does not apply if the eidolon is grappled, helpless, paralyzed, stunned, or unconscious.</p>
			<p><b>Life Bond (Su): </b>At 14th level, the summoner&#146;s life becomes linked to his eidolon&#146;s. As long as the eidolon has 1 or more hit points, the summoner is protected from harm. Damage in excess of that which would reduce the summoner to 0 hit points is instead transferred to the eidolon. This damage is transferred 1 point at a time, meaning that as soon as the eidolon is reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to its Constitution score, all excess damage remains with the summoner. Effects that cause death but don&#146;t deal damage are unaffected by this ability. This ability does not affect spells such as baleful polymorph, flesh to stone, imprisonment, or other spells that don&#146;t deal damage.</p>
			<p><b>Merge Forms (Su): </b>At 16th level, as a full-round action, a summoner can touch his eidolon and the two can merge forms. This transformation includes all of the summoner&#146;s gear. While merged in this way, the summoner is protected from harm and cannot be the target of spells or effects. All effects and spells currently targeting the summoner are suspended until the summoner emerges from the eidolon (although durations continue to expire).</p>
			<p>The summoner can cast spells while inside the eidolon by taking control of the eidolon for the duration of the casting. Any material components used for these spells are taken from the summoner&#146;s gear, even though they are otherwise inaccessible. The summoner can direct all of the eidolon&#146;s actions while merged, can perceive through its senses, and can speak through its voice.</p>
			<p>The summoner can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his summoner level. He can end this effect at any time as a swift action. The summoner emerges in a square adjacent to the eidolon if able. If the eidolon is returned to its home plane while the summoner is merged with it, the summoner is immediately ejected, takes 4d6 points of damage, and is stunned for 1 round.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Aspect (Su): </b>At 18th level, a summoner can divert more of his eidolon&#146;s evolutions to himself. This ability functions as the aspect ability, but the maximum number of evolution points the summoner can divert increases to 6. In addition, the eidolon loses 1 point from its evolution pool for every 2 points (or fraction thereof ) diverted to the summoner instead of losing 1 point from the evolution pool for each point diverted.</p>
			<p><b>Twin Eidolon (Su) </b>: At 20th level, a summoner and his eidolon share a true connection. As a standard action, the summoner can assume the shape of his eidolon, copying all of its evolutions, form, and abilities. His Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores change to match the base scores of his eidolon. He can choose to have any gear that he carries become absorbed by his new form, as with spells from the polymorph subschool. Items with continuous effects continue to function while absorbed in this way. The summoner loses his natural attacks and all racial traits (except bonus feats, skills, and languages) in favor of the abilities granted by his eidolon&#146;s evolutions. The summoner retains all of his class features. The summoner can keep this form for a number of minutes per day equal to his summoner level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The summoner can end this effect as a free action.</p>

					<p>Summoners are proficient with all simple weapons and light armor. A summoner can cast summoner spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, a summoner wearing medium or heavy armor, or using a shield, incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component. A summoner still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells granted by other classes.</p>

					<p>A summoner casts arcane spells drawn from the summoner spell list. (The unchained summoner&#146;s spell list is different from that presented in the Advanced Player&#146;s Guide.) He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time.</p>
					<p>To learn or cast a spell, a summoner must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a summoner&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the summoner&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>A summoner can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level each day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Summoner. In addition, he gains bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells on page 17 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>A summoner&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A summoner begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the summoner&#146;s choice. At each new summoner level, he gains one or more new spells as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Summoner Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a summoner knows is not affected by his Charisma score. The numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.)</p>
					<p>Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third summoner level thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), a summoner can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the summoner &#147;loses&#148; the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level summoner spell the summoner can cast. A summoner can swap out only a single spell at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known.</p>
					<p>A summoner doesn&#146;t need to prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the level.</p>

				<name type="string">Eidolon</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A summoner begins play with the ability to summon to his side a powerful outsider called an eidolon. The eidolon forms a link with the summoner, who forever after summons an aspect of the same creature. Each eidolon has a subtype, chosen when the eidolon is first summoned, that determines its origin and many of its abilities. An eidolon must be within one alignment step of the summoner who calls it (so a neutral good summoner can call a neutral, lawful good, or chaotic good eidolon) and can speak all of his languages. An eidolon is treated as a summoned creature, except it is not sent back to its home plane until reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to or greater than its Constitution score. In addition, due to its tie to its summoner, an eidolon can touch and attack creatures warded by protection from evil and similar effects that prevent contact with summoned creatures.</p>
					<p>A summoner can summon his eidolon in a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform. When summoned in this way, the eidolon&#146;s hit points are unchanged from the last time it was summoned. The only exception to this is if the eidolon was slain, in which case it returns with half its normal hit points. The eidolon does not heal naturally. The eidolon remains until dismissed by the summoner (a standard action). If the eidolon is sent back to its home plane due to death, it cannot be summoned again until the following day. The eidolon cannot be sent back to its home plane by means of dispel magic, but spells such as dismissal and banishment function normally. If the summoner is unconscious, asleep, or killed, his eidolon is immediately banished.</p>
					<p>The eidolon takes a form shaped by the summoner&#146;s desires. The eidolon&#146;s Hit Dice, saving throws, skills, feats, and abilities are tied to the summoner&#146;s class level and increase as the summoner gains levels. In addition, each eidolon gains a pool of evolution points based on the summoner&#146;s class level that can be used to give the eidolon different abilities and powers. Whenever the summoner gains a level, he must decide how these points are spent, and they are set until he gains another level of summoner.</p>
					<p>The eidolon&#146;s physical appearance is up to the summoner, but it always appears as some sort of fantastical creature appropriate to its subtype. This control is not fine enough to make the eidolon appear like a specific creature. The eidolon also bears a glowing rune that is identical to a rune that appears on the summoner&#146;s forehead as long as the eidolon is summoned. While this rune can be hidden through mundane means, it cannot be concealed through magic that changes appearance, such as alter self or polymorph (although invisibility does conceal it as long as the spell lasts).</p>

				<name type="string">Life Link</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a summoner forms a close bond with his eidolon. Whenever the eidolon takes enough damage to send it back to its home plane, as a reaction to the damage, the summoner can sacrifice any number of hit points he has without using an action. Each hit point sacrificed in this way prevents 1 point of damage dealt to the eidolon. This can prevent the eidolon from being sent back to its home plane.</p>
					<p>In addition, the eidolon and the summoner must remain within 100 feet of one another for the eidolon to remain at full strength. If the eidolon is beyond 100 feet but closer than 1,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 50%. If the eidolon is more than 1,000 feet away but closer than 10,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 75%. If the eidolon is more than 10,000 feet away, it is immediately returned to its home plane. Current hit points lost in this way are not restored when the eidolon gets closer to its summoner, but its maximum hit point total does climb to the levels indicated and eventually returns to normal.</p>

A summoner cannot have more than one summon monster or gate spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon monster or gate from this spell-like ability immediately ends.

			<p><i>God callers follow a fractured tradition that originated in the now-lost nation of Sarkoris. They speak to an assortment of ancient divine powers to lead their communities and sometimes stir up reformations in faiths with ideals similar to their personal convictions. Any summoner (including the summoner from Pathfinder Unchained) can select the god caller archetype.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>There are those who take a different path when pursuing the arcane arts, reaching across the boundaries of the world to the far-f lung planes to call forth all manner of creatures to do their bidding. Known as summoners, these arcane practitioners form close bonds with particular outsiders, known as eidolons, which increase in power along with their callers. In the end, summoners and their eidolons become linked, sharing shards of the same souls.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>Most of the summoner&#146;s class features are the same as those of the class&#146;s original design&#151;the biggest change comes to the eidolon. The unchained summoner selects a subtype for his eidolon (such as angel, demon, or protean), which determines a number of its evolutions and helps to shape the eidolon&#146;s general attitude and appearance. In addition, some of the evolutions are now tied to one or more subtypes and base forms, to make eidolons that better match the expected appearances and abilities of such creatures. Finally, the summoner spell list has been greatly revised, removing a number of imbalances.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>2d6 x 10 gp (average 70 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Summoner (Unchained)'s class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Summoners are proficient with all simple weapons and light armor. A summoner can cast summoner spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, a summoner wearing medium or heavy armor, or using a shield, incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component. A summoner still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells granted by other classes.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A summoner casts arcane spells drawn from the summoner spell list. (The unchained summoner&#146;s spell list is different from that presented in the Advanced Player&#146;s Guide.) He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a summoner must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a summoner&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the summoner&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>A summoner can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level each day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Summoner. In addition, he gains bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells on page 17 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A summoner&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A summoner begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the summoner&#146;s choice. At each new summoner level, he gains one or more new spells as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Summoner Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a summoner knows is not affected by his Charisma score. The numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.)</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third summoner level thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), a summoner can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the summoner &#147;loses&#148; the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level summoner spell the summoner can cast. A summoner can swap out only a single spell at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known.</p>
			<p>A summoner doesn&#146;t need to prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>A summoner learns a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots (due to metamagic feats, for example) consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Eidolon: </b>A summoner begins play with the ability to summon to his side a powerful outsider called an eidolon. The eidolon forms a link with the summoner, who forever after summons an aspect of the same creature. Each eidolon has a subtype, chosen when the eidolon is first summoned, that determines its origin and many of its abilities. An eidolon must be within one alignment step of the summoner who calls it (so a neutral good summoner can call a neutral, lawful good, or chaotic good eidolon) and can speak all of his languages. An eidolon is treated as a summoned creature, except it is not sent back to its home plane until reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to or greater than its Constitution score. In addition, due to its tie to its summoner, an eidolon can touch and attack creatures warded by protection from evil and similar effects that prevent contact with summoned creatures.</p>
			<p>A summoner can summon his eidolon in a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform. When summoned in this way, the eidolon&#146;s hit points are unchanged from the last time it was summoned. The only exception to this is if the eidolon was slain, in which case it returns with half its normal hit points. The eidolon does not heal naturally. The eidolon remains until dismissed by the summoner (a standard action). If the eidolon is sent back to its home plane due to death, it cannot be summoned again until the following day. The eidolon cannot be sent back to its home plane by means of dispel magic, but spells such as dismissal and banishment function normally. If the summoner is unconscious, asleep, or killed, his eidolon is immediately banished.</p>
			<p>The eidolon takes a form shaped by the summoner&#146;s desires. The eidolon&#146;s Hit Dice, saving throws, skills, feats, and abilities are tied to the summoner&#146;s class level and increase as the summoner gains levels. In addition, each eidolon gains a pool of evolution points based on the summoner&#146;s class level that can be used to give the eidolon different abilities and powers. Whenever the summoner gains a level, he must decide how these points are spent, and they are set until he gains another level of summoner.</p>
			<p>The eidolon&#146;s physical appearance is up to the summoner, but it always appears as some sort of fantastical creature appropriate to its subtype. This control is not fine enough to make the eidolon appear like a specific creature. The eidolon also bears a glowing rune that is identical to a rune that appears on the summoner&#146;s forehead as long as the eidolon is summoned. While this rune can be hidden through mundane means, it cannot be concealed through magic that changes appearance, such as alter self or polymorph (although invisibility does conceal it as long as the spell lasts).</p>
			<p><b>Guidance (Sp): </b>A god caller&#146;s eidolon has a tiny spark of divinity. It can use guidance as a spell-like ability at will. However, the eidolon and the god caller must remain within 50 feet of one another for the eidolon to remain at full strength. If the eidolon is beyond 50 feet but closer than 1,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by half.</p>
			<p>This ability alters life link.</p>
			<p><b>Life Link (Su): </b>At 1st level, a summoner forms a close bond with his eidolon. Whenever the eidolon takes enough damage to send it back to its home plane, as a reaction to the damage, the summoner can sacrifice any number of hit points he has without using an action. Each hit point sacrificed in this way prevents 1 point of damage dealt to the eidolon. This can prevent the eidolon from being sent back to its home plane.</p>
			<p>In addition, the eidolon and the summoner must remain within 100 feet of one another for the eidolon to remain at full strength. If the eidolon is beyond 100 feet but closer than 1,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 50%. If the eidolon is more than 1,000 feet away but closer than 10,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 75%. If the eidolon is more than 10,000 feet away, it is immediately returned to its home plane. Current hit points lost in this way are not restored when the eidolon gets closer to its summoner, but its maximum hit point total does climb to the levels indicated and eventually returns to normal.</p>
			<p><b>Summon Monster I (Sp): </b>At 1st level, a summoner can cast summon monster I as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Drawing on this ability uses up the same power that the summoner uses to call his eidolon. As a result, he can use this ability only when his eidolon is not summoned. He can cast this spell as a standard action, and the creatures remain for 1 minute per level (instead of 1 round per level). At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the power of this ability increases by 1 spell level, allowing him to summon more powerful creatures (to a maximum of summon monster IX at 17th level). At 19th level, this ability can be used as gate or summon monster IX. If used as gate, the summoner must pay any required material components. A summoner cannot have more than one summon monster or gate spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon monster or gate from this spell-like ability immediately ends. These summon spells are considered to be part of the summoner&#146;s spell list for the purposes of spell trigger and spell completion items. In addition, the summoner can expend uses of this ability to fulfill the construction requirements of any magic item he creates, so long as he can use this ability to cast the required spell.</p>
			<p><b>Bond Senses (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a summoner can, as a standard action, share the senses of his eidolon, hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and touching everything the eidolon does. He can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to his summoner level. There is no maximum range to this effect, but the eidolon and the summoner must be on the same plane. The summoner can end this effect as a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Shield Ally (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a summoner is within his eidolon&#146;s reach, the summoner gains a +2 shield bonus to his Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on his saving throws. This bonus does not apply if the eidolon is grappled, helpless, paralyzed, stunned, or unconscious.</p>
			<p><b>Maker&#146;s Call (Su): </b>At 6th level, as a standard action, a summoner can call his eidolon to his side. This functions as dimension door, using the summoner&#146;s caster level. When this ability is used, the eidolon appears adjacent to the summoner (or as close as possible if all adjacent spaces are occupied). If the eidolon is out of range, the ability is wasted. The summoner can use this ability once per day at 6th level, plus one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 6th.</p>
			<p><b>Divine Word (Ex): </b>At 8th level, if a god caller&#146;s eidolon would grant him a bonus with the aid another action on a Diplomacy or Intimidate check, the god caller can instead choose to roll twice and take the better result. He makes the choice before rolling. Once per day while his eidolon uses the aid another action to assist him in such a check, if the god caller would improve a target&#146;s attitude toward him, or gain a success if using the individual influence rules (Ultimate Intrigue 102), he instead improves that target&#146;s attitude by 2 steps or it counts as 2 successes.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces transposition.</p>
			<p><b>Divine Awareness (Sp): </b>At 10th level, after 10 minutes of concentration, a god caller&#146;s eidolon can see from afar as per clairaudience/clairvoyance. The eidolon can do this once per day at 10th level, and an additional time per day every 4 summoner levels thereafter (maximum of 3 times per day at 18th level).</p>
			<p>This ability replaces aspect.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Shield Ally (Su): </b>At 12th level, whenever an ally is within reach of the summoner&#146;s eidolon, the ally gains a +2 shield bonus to its Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on its saving throws. If this ally is the summoner, these bonuses increase to +4. This bonus does not apply if the eidolon is grappled, helpless, paralyzed, stunned, or unconscious.</p>
			<p><b>Life Bond (Su): </b>At 14th level, the summoner&#146;s life becomes linked to his eidolon&#146;s. As long as the eidolon has 1 or more hit points, the summoner is protected from harm. Damage in excess of that which would reduce the summoner to 0 hit points is instead transferred to the eidolon. This damage is transferred 1 point at a time, meaning that as soon as the eidolon is reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to its Constitution score, all excess damage remains with the summoner. Effects that cause death but don&#146;t deal damage are unaffected by this ability. This ability does not affect spells such as baleful polymorph, flesh to stone, imprisonment, or other spells that don&#146;t deal damage.</p>
			<p><b>Merge Forms (Su): </b>At 16th level, as a full-round action, a summoner can touch his eidolon and the two can merge forms. This transformation includes all of the summoner&#146;s gear. While merged in this way, the summoner is protected from harm and cannot be the target of spells or effects. All effects and spells currently targeting the summoner are suspended until the summoner emerges from the eidolon (although durations continue to expire).</p>
			<p>The summoner can cast spells while inside the eidolon by taking control of the eidolon for the duration of the casting. Any material components used for these spells are taken from the summoner&#146;s gear, even though they are otherwise inaccessible. The summoner can direct all of the eidolon&#146;s actions while merged, can perceive through its senses, and can speak through its voice.</p>
			<p>The summoner can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his summoner level. He can end this effect at any time as a swift action. The summoner emerges in a square adjacent to the eidolon if able. If the eidolon is returned to its home plane while the summoner is merged with it, the summoner is immediately ejected, takes 4d6 points of damage, and is stunned for 1 round.</p>
			<p><b>Divine Might (Ex): </b>At 18th level, a god caller&#146;s eidolon&#146;s attacks are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and harming mythic creatures.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces greater aspect.</p>
			<p><b>Overwhelming Presence (Sp): </b>At 20th level, a god caller&#146;s eidolon can use overwhelming presence (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 230) three times per day. The save DC is equal to 19 + the eidolon&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces twin eidolon</p>

In addition, each eidolon gains a pool of evolution points based on the summoner&#146;s class level that can be used to give the eidolon different abilities and powers. Whenever the summoner gains a level, he must decide how these points are spent, and they are set until he gains another level of summoner.</p>
					<p>The eidolon&#146;s physical appearance is up to the summoner, but it always appears as some sort of fantastical creature appropriate to its subtype. This control is not fine enough to make the eidolon appear like a specific creature. The eidolon also bears a glowing rune that is identical to a rune that appears on the summoner&#146;s forehead as long as the eidolon is summoned. While this rune can be hidden through mundane means, it cannot be concealed through magic that changes appearance, such as alter self or polymorph (although invisibility does conceal it as long as the spell lasts).</p>

					<p>At 1st level, a summoner forms a close bond with his eidolon. Whenever the eidolon takes enough damage to send it back to its home plane, as a reaction to the damage, the summoner can sacrifice any number of hit points he has without using an action. Each hit point sacrificed in this way prevents 1 point of damage dealt to the eidolon. This can prevent the eidolon from being sent back to its home plane.</p>
					<p>In addition, the eidolon and the summoner must remain within 100 feet of one another for the eidolon to remain at full strength. If the eidolon is beyond 100 feet but closer than 1,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 50%. If the eidolon is more than 1,000 feet away but closer than 10,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 75%. If the eidolon is more than 10,000 feet away, it is immediately returned to its home plane. Current hit points lost in this way are not restored when the eidolon gets closer to its summoner, but its maximum hit point total does climb to the levels indicated and eventually returns to normal.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The strange creatures known as fey hail from a variety of places, including the natural world and their own domains on other planes. Fey callers are summoners whose voices reach out into those strange faerie realms and call forth the fey who dwell there. The touch of the fey makes the fey caller different from those summoners who call other outsiders to their sides as eidolons.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>There are those who take a different path when pursuing the arcane arts, reaching across the boundaries of the world to the far-f lung planes to call forth all manner of creatures to do their bidding. Known as summoners, these arcane practitioners form close bonds with particular outsiders, known as eidolons, which increase in power along with their callers. In the end, summoners and their eidolons become linked, sharing shards of the same souls.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>Most of the summoner&#146;s class features are the same as those of the class&#146;s original design&#151;the biggest change comes to the eidolon. The unchained summoner selects a subtype for his eidolon (such as angel, demon, or protean), which determines a number of its evolutions and helps to shape the eidolon&#146;s general attitude and appearance. In addition, some of the evolutions are now tied to one or more subtypes and base forms, to make eidolons that better match the expected appearances and abilities of such creatures. Finally, the summoner spell list has been greatly revised, removing a number of imbalances.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>2d6 x 10 gp (average 70 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Summoner (Unchained)'s class skills are Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Survival (Wis), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Summoners are proficient with all simple weapons and light armor. A summoner can cast summoner spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, a summoner wearing medium or heavy armor, or using a shield, incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component. A summoner still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells granted by other classes.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A summoner casts arcane spells drawn from the summoner spell list. (The unchained summoner&#146;s spell list is different from that presented in the Advanced Player&#146;s Guide.) He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a summoner must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a summoner&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the summoner&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>A summoner can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level each day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Summoner. In addition, he gains bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells on page 17 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A summoner&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A summoner begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the summoner&#146;s choice. At each new summoner level, he gains one or more new spells as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Summoner Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a summoner knows is not affected by his Charisma score. The numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.)</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third summoner level thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), a summoner can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the summoner &#147;loses&#148; the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level summoner spell the summoner can cast. A summoner can swap out only a single spell at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known.</p>
			<p>A summoner doesn&#146;t need to prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>A summoner learns a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots (due to metamagic feats, for example) consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Eidolon: </b>A summoner begins play with the ability to summon to his side a powerful outsider called an eidolon. The eidolon forms a link with the summoner, who forever after summons an aspect of the same creature. Each eidolon has a subtype, chosen when the eidolon is first summoned, that determines its origin and many of its abilities. An eidolon must be within one alignment step of the summoner who calls it (so a neutral good summoner can call a neutral, lawful good, or chaotic good eidolon) and can speak all of his languages. An eidolon is treated as a summoned creature, except it is not sent back to its home plane until reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to or greater than its Constitution score. In addition, due to its tie to its summoner, an eidolon can touch and attack creatures warded by protection from evil and similar effects that prevent contact with summoned creatures.</p>
			<p>A summoner can summon his eidolon in a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform. When summoned in this way, the eidolon&#146;s hit points are unchanged from the last time it was summoned. The only exception to this is if the eidolon was slain, in which case it returns with half its normal hit points. The eidolon does not heal naturally. The eidolon remains until dismissed by the summoner (a standard action). If the eidolon is sent back to its home plane due to death, it cannot be summoned again until the following day. The eidolon cannot be sent back to its home plane by means of dispel magic, but spells such as dismissal and banishment function normally. If the summoner is unconscious, asleep, or killed, his eidolon is immediately banished.</p>
			<p>The eidolon takes a form shaped by the summoner&#146;s desires. The eidolon&#146;s Hit Dice, saving throws, skills, feats, and abilities are tied to the summoner&#146;s class level and increase as the summoner gains levels. In addition, each eidolon gains a pool of evolution points based on the summoner&#146;s class level that can be used to give the eidolon different abilities and powers. Whenever the summoner gains a level, he must decide how these points are spent, and they are set until he gains another level of summoner.</p>
			<p>The eidolon&#146;s physical appearance is up to the summoner, but it always appears as some sort of fantastical creature appropriate to its subtype. This control is not fine enough to make the eidolon appear like a specific creature. The eidolon also bears a glowing rune that is identical to a rune that appears on the summoner&#146;s forehead as long as the eidolon is summoned. While this rune can be hidden through mundane means, it cannot be concealed through magic that changes appearance, such as alter self or polymorph (although invisibility does conceal it as long as the spell lasts).</p>
			<p><b>Fey Eidolon: </b>A fey caller&#146;s eidolon is still an outsider, and its base statistics don&#146;t change, but it also counts as a fey. A fey caller's eidolon has the Fey subtype instead of one of the subtypes from Pathfinder Unchained.</p>
			<p><b>Life Link (Su): </b>At 1st level, a summoner forms a close bond with his eidolon. Whenever the eidolon takes enough damage to send it back to its home plane, as a reaction to the damage, the summoner can sacrifice any number of hit points he has without using an action. Each hit point sacrificed in this way prevents 1 point of damage dealt to the eidolon. This can prevent the eidolon from being sent back to its home plane.</p>
			<p>In addition, the eidolon and the summoner must remain within 100 feet of one another for the eidolon to remain at full strength. If the eidolon is beyond 100 feet but closer than 1,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 50%. If the eidolon is more than 1,000 feet away but closer than 10,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 75%. If the eidolon is more than 10,000 feet away, it is immediately returned to its home plane. Current hit points lost in this way are not restored when the eidolon gets closer to its summoner, but its maximum hit point total does climb to the levels indicated and eventually returns to normal.</p>
			<p><b>Nature&#146;s Call: </b>Instead of summoning creatures from the summon monster list, the fey caller&#146;s summoning spell-like ability summons creatures from the list for the summon nature&#146;s ally spell of the same level. It still follows the other rules and restrictions for the summoner&#146;s summon monster spell-like ability.</p>
			<p>This ability alters the summoner&#146;s summon monster spell-like ability.</p>
			<p><b>Summon Monster I (Sp): </b>At 1st level, a summoner can cast summon monster I as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Drawing on this ability uses up the same power that the summoner uses to call his eidolon. As a result, he can use this ability only when his eidolon is not summoned. He can cast this spell as a standard action, and the creatures remain for 1 minute per level (instead of 1 round per level). At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the power of this ability increases by 1 spell level, allowing him to summon more powerful creatures (to a maximum of summon monster IX at 17th level). At 19th level, this ability can be used as gate or summon monster IX. If used as gate, the summoner must pay any required material components. A summoner cannot have more than one summon monster or gate spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon monster or gate from this spell-like ability immediately ends. These summon spells are considered to be part of the summoner&#146;s spell list for the purposes of spell trigger and spell completion items. In addition, the summoner can expend uses of this ability to fulfill the construction requirements of any magic item he creates, so long as he can use this ability to cast the required spell.</p>
			<p><b>Bond Senses (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a summoner can, as a standard action, share the senses of his eidolon, hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and touching everything the eidolon does. He can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to his summoner level. There is no maximum range to this effect, but the eidolon and the summoner must be on the same plane. The summoner can end this effect as a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Shield Ally (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a summoner is within his eidolon&#146;s reach, the summoner gains a +2 shield bonus to his Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on his saving throws. This bonus does not apply if the eidolon is grappled, helpless, paralyzed, stunned, or unconscious.</p>
			<p><b>Maker&#146;s Call (Su): </b>At 6th level, as a standard action, a summoner can call his eidolon to his side. This functions as dimension door, using the summoner&#146;s caster level. When this ability is used, the eidolon appears adjacent to the summoner (or as close as possible if all adjacent spaces are occupied). If the eidolon is out of range, the ability is wasted. The summoner can use this ability once per day at 6th level, plus one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 6th.</p>
			<p><b>Transposition (Su): </b>At 8th level, a summoner can use his maker&#146;s call ability to swap locations with his eidolon. If the eidolon occupies more squares than the summoner, the summoner can appear in any square occupied by the eidolon. The eidolon must occupy the square that was occupied by the summoner if able, or as close as possible if it is not able.</p>
			<p><b>Aspect (Su): </b>At 10th level, a summoner can divert up to 2 points from his eidolon&#146;s evolution pool to add evolutions to himself. He cannot select any evolution that the eidolon could not possess, and he must be able to meet the requirements as well (except for subtype requirements, so long as his eidolon meets the subtype requirement). He cannot select the ability increase evolution through this ability. Any points spent in this way are taken from the eidolon&#146;s evolution pool (reducing the total number available to the eidolon). The summoner can change the evolutions granted by these points anytime he can change the eidolon&#146;s evolutions.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Shield Ally (Su): </b>At 12th level, whenever an ally is within reach of the summoner&#146;s eidolon, the ally gains a +2 shield bonus to its Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on its saving throws. If this ally is the summoner, these bonuses increase to +4. This bonus does not apply if the eidolon is grappled, helpless, paralyzed, stunned, or unconscious.</p>
			<p><b>Life Bond (Su): </b>At 14th level, the summoner&#146;s life becomes linked to his eidolon&#146;s. As long as the eidolon has 1 or more hit points, the summoner is protected from harm. Damage in excess of that which would reduce the summoner to 0 hit points is instead transferred to the eidolon. This damage is transferred 1 point at a time, meaning that as soon as the eidolon is reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to its Constitution score, all excess damage remains with the summoner. Effects that cause death but don&#146;t deal damage are unaffected by this ability. This ability does not affect spells such as baleful polymorph, flesh to stone, imprisonment, or other spells that don&#146;t deal damage.</p>
			<p><b>Merge Forms (Su): </b>At 16th level, as a full-round action, a summoner can touch his eidolon and the two can merge forms. This transformation includes all of the summoner&#146;s gear. While merged in this way, the summoner is protected from harm and cannot be the target of spells or effects. All effects and spells currently targeting the summoner are suspended until the summoner emerges from the eidolon (although durations continue to expire).</p>
			<p>The summoner can cast spells while inside the eidolon by taking control of the eidolon for the duration of the casting. Any material components used for these spells are taken from the summoner&#146;s gear, even though they are otherwise inaccessible. The summoner can direct all of the eidolon&#146;s actions while merged, can perceive through its senses, and can speak through its voice.</p>
			<p>The summoner can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his summoner level. He can end this effect at any time as a swift action. The summoner emerges in a square adjacent to the eidolon if able. If the eidolon is returned to its home plane while the summoner is merged with it, the summoner is immediately ejected, takes 4d6 points of damage, and is stunned for 1 round.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Aspect (Su): </b>At 18th level, a summoner can divert more of his eidolon&#146;s evolutions to himself. This ability functions as the aspect ability, but the maximum number of evolution points the summoner can divert increases to 6. In addition, the eidolon loses 1 point from its evolution pool for every 2 points (or fraction thereof ) diverted to the summoner instead of losing 1 point from the evolution pool for each point diverted.</p>
			<p><b>Twin Eidolon (Su) </b>: At 20th level, a summoner and his eidolon share a true connection. As a standard action, the summoner can assume the shape of his eidolon, copying all of its evolutions, form, and abilities. His Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores change to match the base scores of his eidolon. He can choose to have any gear that he carries become absorbed by his new form, as with spells from the polymorph subschool. Items with continuous effects continue to function while absorbed in this way. The summoner loses his natural attacks and all racial traits (except bonus feats, skills, and languages) in favor of the abilities granted by his eidolon&#146;s evolutions. The summoner retains all of his class features. The summoner can keep this form for a number of minutes per day equal to his summoner level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The summoner can end this effect as a free action.</p>

					<p>At 1st level, a summoner can cast summon monster I as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Drawing on this ability uses up the same power that the summoner uses to call his eidolon. As a result, he can use this ability only when his eidolon is not summoned. He can cast this spell as a standard action, and the creatures remain for 1 minute per level (instead of 1 round per level). At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the power of this ability increases by 1 spell level, allowing him to summon more powerful creatures (to a maximum of summon monster IX at 17th level). At 19th level, this ability can be used as gate or summon monster IX. If used as gate, the summoner must pay any required material components. A summoner cannot have more than one summon monster or gate spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon monster or gate from this spell-like ability immediately ends. These summon spells are considered to be part of the summoner&#146;s spell list for the purposes of spell trigger and spell completion items. In addition, the summoner can expend uses of this ability to fulfill the construction requirements of any magic item he creates, so long as he can use this ability to cast the required spell.</p>

					<p>At 8th level, a devil impostor can use her maker&#146;s call ability to immediately dismiss her eidolon and take on its appearance. This functions as a modified alter self spell, transforming the devil impostor into a replica of her eidolon. She gains a single natural attack possessed by her eidolon, and if her eidolon is smaller than Small or larger than Medium, she assumes the form of a Small- or Medium-sized version of her eidolon, respectively. The transformation lasts for 10 minutes &#215; her unchained summoner level or until the eidolon is resummoned. This ability replaces transposition.</p>

He cannot select the ability increase evolution through this ability.

Damage in excess of that which would reduce the summoner to 0 hit points is instead transferred to the eidolon. This damage is transferred 1 point at a time, meaning that as soon as the eidolon is reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to its Constitution score, all excess damage remains with the summoner. Effects that cause death but don&#146;t deal damage are unaffected by this ability.

While merged in this way, the summoner is protected from harm and cannot be the target of spells or effects. All effects and spells currently targeting the summoner are suspended until the summoner emerges from the eidolon (although durations continue to expire).</p>
					<p>The summoner can cast spells while inside the eidolon by taking control of the eidolon for the duration of the casting. Any material components used for these spells are taken from the summoner&#146;s gear, even though they are otherwise inaccessible. The summoner can direct all of the eidolon&#146;s actions while merged, can perceive through its senses, and can speak through its voice.</p>
					<p>The summoner can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his summoner level. He can end this effect at any time as a swift action. The summoner emerges in a square adjacent to the eidolon if able. If the eidolon is returned to its home plane while the summoner is merged with it, the summoner is immediately ejected, takes 4d6 points of damage, and is stunned for 1 round.</p>

His Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores change to match the base scores of his eidolon. He can choose to have any gear that he carries become absorbed by his new form, as with spells from the polymorph subschool. Items with continuous effects continue to function while absorbed in this way. The summoner loses his natural attacks and all racial traits (except bonus feats, skills, and languages) in favor of the abilities granted by his eidolon&#146;s evolutions. The summoner retains all of his class features. The summoner can keep this form for a number of minutes per day equal to his summoner level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The summoner can end this effect as a free action.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some summoners can&#146;t abide the cruelty of devils, or simply can&#146;t outwit them, but must appear to do so to get by in Cheliax, the Outer Planes, or similar areas of infernal influence. Rather than risk binding true devils, they reshape their eidolons into deceptive forms.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>There are those who take a different path when pursuing the arcane arts, reaching across the boundaries of the world to the far-f lung planes to call forth all manner of creatures to do their bidding. Known as summoners, these arcane practitioners form close bonds with particular outsiders, known as eidolons, which increase in power along with their callers. In the end, summoners and their eidolons become linked, sharing shards of the same souls.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>Most of the summoner&#146;s class features are the same as those of the class&#146;s original design&#151;the biggest change comes to the eidolon. The unchained summoner selects a subtype for his eidolon (such as angel, demon, or protean), which determines a number of its evolutions and helps to shape the eidolon&#146;s general attitude and appearance. In addition, some of the evolutions are now tied to one or more subtypes and base forms, to make eidolons that better match the expected appearances and abilities of such creatures. Finally, the summoner spell list has been greatly revised, removing a number of imbalances.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>2d6 x 10 gp (average 70 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Summoner (Unchained)'s class skills are Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Summoners are proficient with all simple weapons and light armor. A summoner can cast summoner spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, a summoner wearing medium or heavy armor, or using a shield, incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component. A summoner still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells granted by other classes.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A summoner casts arcane spells drawn from the summoner spell list. (The unchained summoner&#146;s spell list is different from that presented in the Advanced Player&#146;s Guide.) He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a summoner must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a summoner&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the summoner&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>A summoner can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level each day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Summoner. In addition, he gains bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells on page 17 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A summoner&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A summoner begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the summoner&#146;s choice. At each new summoner level, he gains one or more new spells as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Summoner Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a summoner knows is not affected by his Charisma score. The numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.)</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third summoner level thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), a summoner can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the summoner &#147;loses&#148; the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level summoner spell the summoner can cast. A summoner can swap out only a single spell at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known.</p>
			<p>A summoner doesn&#146;t need to prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>A summoner learns a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots (due to metamagic feats, for example) consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Eidolon: </b>A summoner begins play with the ability to summon to his side a powerful outsider called an eidolon. The eidolon forms a link with the summoner, who forever after summons an aspect of the same creature. Each eidolon has a subtype, chosen when the eidolon is first summoned, that determines its origin and many of its abilities. An eidolon must be within one alignment step of the summoner who calls it (so a neutral good summoner can call a neutral, lawful good, or chaotic good eidolon) and can speak all of his languages. An eidolon is treated as a summoned creature, except it is not sent back to its home plane until reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to or greater than its Constitution score. In addition, due to its tie to its summoner, an eidolon can touch and attack creatures warded by protection from evil and similar effects that prevent contact with summoned creatures.</p>
			<p>A summoner can summon his eidolon in a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform. When summoned in this way, the eidolon&#146;s hit points are unchanged from the last time it was summoned. The only exception to this is if the eidolon was slain, in which case it returns with half its normal hit points. The eidolon does not heal naturally. The eidolon remains until dismissed by the summoner (a standard action). If the eidolon is sent back to its home plane due to death, it cannot be summoned again until the following day. The eidolon cannot be sent back to its home plane by means of dispel magic, but spells such as dismissal and banishment function normally. If the summoner is unconscious, asleep, or killed, his eidolon is immediately banished.</p>
			<p>The eidolon takes a form shaped by the summoner&#146;s desires. The eidolon&#146;s Hit Dice, saving throws, skills, feats, and abilities are tied to the summoner&#146;s class level and increase as the summoner gains levels. In addition, each eidolon gains a pool of evolution points based on the summoner&#146;s class level that can be used to give the eidolon different abilities and powers. Whenever the summoner gains a level, he must decide how these points are spent, and they are set until he gains another level of summoner.</p>
			<p>The eidolon&#146;s physical appearance is up to the summoner, but it always appears as some sort of fantastical creature appropriate to its subtype. This control is not fine enough to make the eidolon appear like a specific creature. The eidolon also bears a glowing rune that is identical to a rune that appears on the summoner&#146;s forehead as long as the eidolon is summoned. While this rune can be hidden through mundane means, it cannot be concealed through magic that changes appearance, such as alter self or polymorph (although invisibility does conceal it as long as the spell lasts).</p>
			<p><b>Deceptive Eidolon: </b>A devil impostor&#146;s eidolon always resembles a specific type of devil of the same size (caster&#146;s choice), and radiates the aura of a lawful evil outsider under magical effects such as detect evil, regardless of its actual alignment. The eidolon still uses its actual alignment when resolving all other alignment-dependent abilities, effects, and spells. The eidolon can have any subtype, though its appearance always remains that of a devil, and it can select only evolutions available to its true subtype. This modifies the normal eidolon rules.</p>
			<p><b>Fiendish Summons (Sp): </b>A devil impostor must apply the fiendish template to any creatures summoned via her summon monster spell-like ability regardless of her alignment. This alters the unchained summoner&#146;s summon monster ability.</p>
			<p><b>Life Link (Su): </b>At 1st level, a summoner forms a close bond with his eidolon. Whenever the eidolon takes enough damage to send it back to its home plane, as a reaction to the damage, the summoner can sacrifice any number of hit points he has without using an action. Each hit point sacrificed in this way prevents 1 point of damage dealt to the eidolon. This can prevent the eidolon from being sent back to its home plane.</p>
			<p>In addition, the eidolon and the summoner must remain within 100 feet of one another for the eidolon to remain at full strength. If the eidolon is beyond 100 feet but closer than 1,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 50%. If the eidolon is more than 1,000 feet away but closer than 10,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 75%. If the eidolon is more than 10,000 feet away, it is immediately returned to its home plane. Current hit points lost in this way are not restored when the eidolon gets closer to its summoner, but its maximum hit point total does climb to the levels indicated and eventually returns to normal.</p>
			<p><b>Summon Monster I (Sp): </b>At 1st level, a summoner can cast summon monster I as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Drawing on this ability uses up the same power that the summoner uses to call his eidolon. As a result, he can use this ability only when his eidolon is not summoned. He can cast this spell as a standard action, and the creatures remain for 1 minute per level (instead of 1 round per level). At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the power of this ability increases by 1 spell level, allowing him to summon more powerful creatures (to a maximum of summon monster IX at 17th level). At 19th level, this ability can be used as gate or summon monster IX. If used as gate, the summoner must pay any required material components. A summoner cannot have more than one summon monster or gate spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon monster or gate from this spell-like ability immediately ends. These summon spells are considered to be part of the summoner&#146;s spell list for the purposes of spell trigger and spell completion items. In addition, the summoner can expend uses of this ability to fulfill the construction requirements of any magic item he creates, so long as he can use this ability to cast the required spell.</p>
			<p><b>Bond Alignment (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a devil impostor and her eidolon both radiate alignment auras of lawful evil for the purpose of divination spells that reveal auras (such as detect evil), as long as they remain within 1,000 feet of one another. This does not affect other abilities that depend on alignment (such as smite evil). The devil impostor can suppress this effect for 1 minute as a standard action. This ability replaces bond senses.</p>
			<p><b>Devil&#146;s Flesh (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a devil impostor&#146;s eidolon adopts several fiendish traits. The devil impostor&#146;s eidolon gains the skilled (Bluff ) and resistance (fire) evolutions (or immunity [fire] if it already has resistance to fire). The eidolon can select additional evolutions available to the devil subtype. This ability replaces shield ally.</p>
			<p><b>Maker&#146;s Call (Su): </b>At 6th level, as a standard action, a summoner can call his eidolon to his side. This functions as dimension door, using the summoner&#146;s caster level. When this ability is used, the eidolon appears adjacent to the summoner (or as close as possible if all adjacent spaces are occupied). If the eidolon is out of range, the ability is wasted. The summoner can use this ability once per day at 6th level, plus one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 6th.</p>
			<p><b>Fiendish Appearance (Su): </b>At 8th level, a devil impostor can use her maker&#146;s call ability to immediately dismiss her eidolon and take on its appearance. This functions as a modified alter self spell, transforming the devil impostor into a replica of her eidolon. She gains a single natural attack possessed by her eidolon, and if her eidolon is smaller than Small or larger than Medium, she assumes the form of a Small- or Medium-sized version of her eidolon, respectively. The transformation lasts for 10 minutes &#215; her unchained summoner level or until the eidolon is resummoned. This ability replaces transposition.</p>
			<p><b>Aspect (Su): </b>At 10th level, a summoner can divert up to 2 points from his eidolon&#146;s evolution pool to add evolutions to himself. He cannot select any evolution that the eidolon could not possess, and he must be able to meet the requirements as well (except for subtype requirements, so long as his eidolon meets the subtype requirement). He cannot select the ability increase evolution through this ability. Any points spent in this way are taken from the eidolon&#146;s evolution pool (reducing the total number available to the eidolon). The summoner can change the evolutions granted by these points anytime he can change the eidolon&#146;s evolutions.</p>
			<p><b>Devil&#146;s Tongue (Ex): </b>At 12th level, the devil impostor&#146;s eidolon can apply its master&#146;s skill ranks and proficiency bonuses when attempting Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate skill checks. This ability replaces greater shield ally.</p>
			<p><b>Life Bond (Su): </b>At 14th level, the summoner&#146;s life becomes linked to his eidolon&#146;s. As long as the eidolon has 1 or more hit points, the summoner is protected from harm. Damage in excess of that which would reduce the summoner to 0 hit points is instead transferred to the eidolon. This damage is transferred 1 point at a time, meaning that as soon as the eidolon is reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to its Constitution score, all excess damage remains with the summoner. Effects that cause death but don&#146;t deal damage are unaffected by this ability. This ability does not affect spells such as baleful polymorph, flesh to stone, imprisonment, or other spells that don&#146;t deal damage.</p>
			<p><b>Merge Forms (Su): </b>At 16th level, as a full-round action, a summoner can touch his eidolon and the two can merge forms. This transformation includes all of the summoner&#146;s gear. While merged in this way, the summoner is protected from harm and cannot be the target of spells or effects. All effects and spells currently targeting the summoner are suspended until the summoner emerges from the eidolon (although durations continue to expire).</p>
			<p>The summoner can cast spells while inside the eidolon by taking control of the eidolon for the duration of the casting. Any material components used for these spells are taken from the summoner&#146;s gear, even though they are otherwise inaccessible. The summoner can direct all of the eidolon&#146;s actions while merged, can perceive through its senses, and can speak through its voice.</p>
			<p>The summoner can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his summoner level. He can end this effect at any time as a swift action. The summoner emerges in a square adjacent to the eidolon if able. If the eidolon is returned to its home plane while the summoner is merged with it, the summoner is immediately ejected, takes 4d6 points of damage, and is stunned for 1 round.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Aspect (Su): </b>At 18th level, a summoner can divert more of his eidolon&#146;s evolutions to himself. This ability functions as the aspect ability, but the maximum number of evolution points the summoner can divert increases to 6. In addition, the eidolon loses 1 point from its evolution pool for every 2 points (or fraction thereof ) diverted to the summoner instead of losing 1 point from the evolution pool for each point diverted.</p>
			<p><b>Twin Eidolon (Su) </b>: At 20th level, a summoner and his eidolon share a true connection. As a standard action, the summoner can assume the shape of his eidolon, copying all of its evolutions, form, and abilities. His Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores change to match the base scores of his eidolon. He can choose to have any gear that he carries become absorbed by his new form, as with spells from the polymorph subschool. Items with continuous effects continue to function while absorbed in this way. The summoner loses his natural attacks and all racial traits (except bonus feats, skills, and languages) in favor of the abilities granted by his eidolon&#146;s evolutions. The summoner retains all of his class features. The summoner can keep this form for a number of minutes per day equal to his summoner level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The summoner can end this effect as a free action.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>While many assume Hellknights are worshipers or agents of devilkind&#151;or, at best, duped puppets of the infernal realm&#151;most Hellknights see Hell and its native devils as a challenge to be conquered. If one can dominate these beings of pure (albeit cruel) law, then the power of that law is theirs by right. While the Test undertaken by those who seek to become full Hellknights is one method by which this power is earned, the devil binder takes this philosophy a step further, forcing a devil into service.</i></p>
			<p><i>Unlike those of most summoners, a devil binder&#146;s eidolon does not willingly serve its master due to a similar philosophical bent. While some devil binders (especially those who do serve Hell) seek more amicable relationships with these infernal servants, others treat their eidolons as mere tools, remorselessly ordering the devils into battle. The nature of the summoner&#146;s magical bond is irrevocably altered by their style of invocation. A devil binder borrows extraplanar quintessence from her eidolon, gaining strange abilities for herself and evolving her eidolon&#146;s magical powers.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>There are those who take a different path when pursuing the arcane arts, reaching across the boundaries of the world to the far-f lung planes to call forth all manner of creatures to do their bidding. Known as summoners, these arcane practitioners form close bonds with particular outsiders, known as eidolons, which increase in power along with their callers. In the end, summoners and their eidolons become linked, sharing shards of the same souls.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>Most of the summoner&#146;s class features are the same as those of the class&#146;s original design&#151;the biggest change comes to the eidolon. The unchained summoner selects a subtype for his eidolon (such as angel, demon, or protean), which determines a number of its evolutions and helps to shape the eidolon&#146;s general attitude and appearance. In addition, some of the evolutions are now tied to one or more subtypes and base forms, to make eidolons that better match the expected appearances and abilities of such creatures. Finally, the summoner spell list has been greatly revised, removing a number of imbalances.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>The infernal bargains and rituals a devil binder pursues leave an indelible stain upon her soul. A devil binder must be lawful evil or lawful neutral in alignment.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>2d6 x 10 gp (average 70 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Summoner (Unchained)'s class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Summoners are proficient with all simple weapons and light armor. A summoner can cast summoner spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, a summoner wearing medium or heavy armor, or using a shield, incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component. A summoner still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells granted by other classes.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A summoner casts arcane spells drawn from the summoner spell list. (The unchained summoner&#146;s spell list is different from that presented in the Advanced Player&#146;s Guide.) He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a summoner must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a summoner&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the summoner&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>A summoner can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level each day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Summoner. In addition, he gains bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells on page 17 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A summoner&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A summoner begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the summoner&#146;s choice. At each new summoner level, he gains one or more new spells as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Summoner Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a summoner knows is not affected by his Charisma score. The numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.)</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third summoner level thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), a summoner can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the summoner &#147;loses&#148; the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level summoner spell the summoner can cast. A summoner can swap out only a single spell at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known.</p>
			<p>A summoner doesn&#146;t need to prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>A summoner learns a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots (due to metamagic feats, for example) consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Eidolon: </b>A summoner begins play with the ability to summon to his side a powerful outsider called an eidolon. The eidolon forms a link with the summoner, who forever after summons an aspect of the same creature. Each eidolon has a subtype, chosen when the eidolon is first summoned, that determines its origin and many of its abilities. An eidolon must be within one alignment step of the summoner who calls it (so a neutral good summoner can call a neutral, lawful good, or chaotic good eidolon) and can speak all of his languages. An eidolon is treated as a summoned creature, except it is not sent back to its home plane until reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to or greater than its Constitution score. In addition, due to its tie to its summoner, an eidolon can touch and attack creatures warded by protection from evil and similar effects that prevent contact with summoned creatures.</p>
			<p>A summoner can summon his eidolon in a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform. When summoned in this way, the eidolon&#146;s hit points are unchanged from the last time it was summoned. The only exception to this is if the eidolon was slain, in which case it returns with half its normal hit points. The eidolon does not heal naturally. The eidolon remains until dismissed by the summoner (a standard action). If the eidolon is sent back to its home plane due to death, it cannot be summoned again until the following day. The eidolon cannot be sent back to its home plane by means of dispel magic, but spells such as dismissal and banishment function normally. If the summoner is unconscious, asleep, or killed, his eidolon is immediately banished.</p>
			<p>The eidolon takes a form shaped by the summoner&#146;s desires. The eidolon&#146;s Hit Dice, saving throws, skills, feats, and abilities are tied to the summoner&#146;s class level and increase as the summoner gains levels. In addition, each eidolon gains a pool of evolution points based on the summoner&#146;s class level that can be used to give the eidolon different abilities and powers. Whenever the summoner gains a level, he must decide how these points are spent, and they are set until he gains another level of summoner.</p>
			<p>The eidolon&#146;s physical appearance is up to the summoner, but it always appears as some sort of fantastical creature appropriate to its subtype. This control is not fine enough to make the eidolon appear like a specific creature. The eidolon also bears a glowing rune that is identical to a rune that appears on the summoner&#146;s forehead as long as the eidolon is summoned. While this rune can be hidden through mundane means, it cannot be concealed through magic that changes appearance, such as alter self or polymorph (although invisibility does conceal it as long as the spell lasts).</p>
			<p><b>Infernal Binding (Ex): </b>A devil binder must select an eidolon of the devil subtype. The devil binder&#146;s eidolon never increases its maximum number of attacks, and its base attack bonus is equal to half its Hit Dice. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the eidolon&#146;s Charisma score increases by 2.</p>
			<p>This alters the summoner&#146;s eidolon.</p>
			<p><b>Infernal Arcana (Sp): </b>At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the devil binder&#146;s eidolon gains the following spell-like abilities: protection from chaos (1st), scorching ray (3rd), suggestion (5th), charm monster (7th), dominate person (9th), planar binding (devils only) (11th), greater teleport (13th), power word stun (15th), meteor swarm (17th). Each of these spell-like abilities is usable once per day, and the eidolon&#146;s caster level is equal to the devil binder&#146;s summoner level. When the eidolon casts planar binding this way, the devil binder is considered to be the spell&#146;s caster instead. At 19th level, the devil binder&#146;s eidolon can use each of its infernal arcana spell-like abilities three times per day.</p>
			<p>This replaces the summon monster I summoner class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Life Link (Su): </b>At 1st level, a summoner forms a close bond with his eidolon. Whenever the eidolon takes enough damage to send it back to its home plane, as a reaction to the damage, the summoner can sacrifice any number of hit points he has without using an action. Each hit point sacrificed in this way prevents 1 point of damage dealt to the eidolon. This can prevent the eidolon from being sent back to its home plane.</p>
			<p>In addition, the eidolon and the summoner must remain within 100 feet of one another for the eidolon to remain at full strength. If the eidolon is beyond 100 feet but closer than 1,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 50%. If the eidolon is more than 1,000 feet away but closer than 10,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 75%. If the eidolon is more than 10,000 feet away, it is immediately returned to its home plane. Current hit points lost in this way are not restored when the eidolon gets closer to its summoner, but its maximum hit point total does climb to the levels indicated and eventually returns to normal.</p>
			<p><b>Infernal Affinity (Ex, Su, or Sp): </b>A devil binder wrenches Hell&#146;s power from her eidolon. This grants the devil binder the bloodline powers of the infernal sorcerer bloodline (gained at the following levels): corrupting touch (4th), infernal resistances (8th), hellfire (12th), on dark wings (16th), and power of the Pit (20th). The devil binder treats her summoner level as her sorcerer level for the purpose of determining their effects.</p>
			<p>This replaces bond senses, shield ally, transposition, greater shield ally, merge forms, and twin eidolon.</p>
			<p><b>Smite Chaos (Su): </b>At 6th level, the summoner&#146;s eidolon gains the ability to smite chaos as a Hellknight (see page 90) of its Hit Dice. This ability can be used once per day and an additional time for every 4 levels beyond 6th.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces maker&#146;s call and the eidolon&#146;s devotion ability.</p>
			<p><b>Aspect (Su): </b>At 10th level, a summoner can divert up to 2 points from his eidolon&#146;s evolution pool to add evolutions to himself. He cannot select any evolution that the eidolon could not possess, and he must be able to meet the requirements as well (except for subtype requirements, so long as his eidolon meets the subtype requirement). He cannot select the ability increase evolution through this ability. Any points spent in this way are taken from the eidolon&#146;s evolution pool (reducing the total number available to the eidolon). The summoner can change the evolutions granted by these points anytime he can change the eidolon&#146;s evolutions.</p>
			<p><b>Life Bond (Su): </b>At 14th level, the summoner&#146;s life becomes linked to his eidolon&#146;s. As long as the eidolon has 1 or more hit points, the summoner is protected from harm. Damage in excess of that which would reduce the summoner to 0 hit points is instead transferred to the eidolon. This damage is transferred 1 point at a time, meaning that as soon as the eidolon is reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to its Constitution score, all excess damage remains with the summoner. Effects that cause death but don&#146;t deal damage are unaffected by this ability. This ability does not affect spells such as baleful polymorph, flesh to stone, imprisonment, or other spells that don&#146;t deal damage.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Aspect (Su): </b>At 18th level, a summoner can divert more of his eidolon&#146;s evolutions to himself. This ability functions as the aspect ability, but the maximum number of evolution points the summoner can divert increases to 6. In addition, the eidolon loses 1 point from its evolution pool for every 2 points (or fraction thereof ) diverted to the summoner instead of losing 1 point from the evolution pool for each point diverted.</p>

Each hit point sacrificed in this way prevents 1 point of damage dealt to the eidolon. This can prevent the eidolon from being sent back to its home plane.</p>
					<p>In addition, the eidolon and the summoner must remain within 100 feet of one another for the eidolon to remain at full strength. If the eidolon is beyond 100 feet but closer than 1,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 50%. If the eidolon is more than 1,000 feet away but closer than 10,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 75%. If the eidolon is more than 10,000 feet away, it is immediately returned to its home plane. Current hit points lost in this way are not restored when the eidolon gets closer to its summoner, but its maximum hit point total does climb to the levels indicated and eventually returns to normal.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Construct callers use their mechanical and planar understandings to work planar energies as a tinkerer works parts. They use this understanding to hand-craft unique, constructed eidolons.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>There are those who take a different path when pursuing the arcane arts, reaching across the boundaries of the world to the far-f lung planes to call forth all manner of creatures to do their bidding. Known as summoners, these arcane practitioners form close bonds with particular outsiders, known as eidolons, which increase in power along with their callers. In the end, summoners and their eidolons become linked, sharing shards of the same souls.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>Most of the summoner&#146;s class features are the same as those of the class&#146;s original design&#151;the biggest change comes to the eidolon. The unchained summoner selects a subtype for his eidolon (such as angel, demon, or protean), which determines a number of its evolutions and helps to shape the eidolon&#146;s general attitude and appearance. In addition, some of the evolutions are now tied to one or more subtypes and base forms, to make eidolons that better match the expected appearances and abilities of such creatures. Finally, the summoner spell list has been greatly revised, removing a number of imbalances.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>2d6 x 10 gp (average 70 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Summoner (Unchained)'s class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Summoners are proficient with all simple weapons and light armor. A summoner can cast summoner spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, a summoner wearing medium or heavy armor, or using a shield, incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component. A summoner still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells granted by other classes.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A summoner casts arcane spells drawn from the summoner spell list. (The unchained summoner&#146;s spell list is different from that presented in the Advanced Player&#146;s Guide.) He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a summoner must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a summoner&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the summoner&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>A summoner can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level each day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Summoner. In addition, he gains bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells on page 17 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A summoner&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A summoner begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the summoner&#146;s choice. At each new summoner level, he gains one or more new spells as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Summoner Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a summoner knows is not affected by his Charisma score. The numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.)</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third summoner level thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), a summoner can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the summoner &#147;loses&#148; the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level summoner spell the summoner can cast. A summoner can swap out only a single spell at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known.</p>
			<p>A summoner doesn&#146;t need to prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>A summoner learns a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots (due to metamagic feats, for example) consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Eidolon: </b>A summoner begins play with the ability to summon to his side a powerful outsider called an eidolon. The eidolon forms a link with the summoner, who forever after summons an aspect of the same creature. Each eidolon has a subtype, chosen when the eidolon is first summoned, that determines its origin and many of its abilities. An eidolon must be within one alignment step of the summoner who calls it (so a neutral good summoner can call a neutral, lawful good, or chaotic good eidolon) and can speak all of his languages. An eidolon is treated as a summoned creature, except it is not sent back to its home plane until reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to or greater than its Constitution score. In addition, due to its tie to its summoner, an eidolon can touch and attack creatures warded by protection from evil and similar effects that prevent contact with summoned creatures.</p>
			<p>A summoner can summon his eidolon in a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform. When summoned in this way, the eidolon&#146;s hit points are unchanged from the last time it was summoned. The only exception to this is if the eidolon was slain, in which case it returns with half its normal hit points. The eidolon does not heal naturally. The eidolon remains until dismissed by the summoner (a standard action). If the eidolon is sent back to its home plane due to death, it cannot be summoned again until the following day. The eidolon cannot be sent back to its home plane by means of dispel magic, but spells such as dismissal and banishment function normally. If the summoner is unconscious, asleep, or killed, his eidolon is immediately banished.</p>
			<p>The eidolon takes a form shaped by the summoner&#146;s desires. The eidolon&#146;s Hit Dice, saving throws, skills, feats, and abilities are tied to the summoner&#146;s class level and increase as the summoner gains levels. In addition, each eidolon gains a pool of evolution points based on the summoner&#146;s class level that can be used to give the eidolon different abilities and powers. Whenever the summoner gains a level, he must decide how these points are spent, and they are set until he gains another level of summoner.</p>
			<p>The eidolon&#146;s physical appearance is up to the summoner, but it always appears as some sort of fantastical creature appropriate to its subtype. This control is not fine enough to make the eidolon appear like a specific creature. The eidolon also bears a glowing rune that is identical to a rune that appears on the summoner&#146;s forehead as long as the eidolon is summoned. While this rune can be hidden through mundane means, it cannot be concealed through magic that changes appearance, such as alter self or polymorph (although invisibility does conceal it as long as the spell lasts).</p>
			<p><b>Construct Eidolon (Ex): </b>A construct caller must select the inevitable subtype for her eidolon. A construct eidolon functions as an inevitable eidolon except as noted here. A construct eidolon can be of any alignment. It has no Constitution score and gains bonus hit points appropriate for a construct of its size. At 12th level, the construct eidolon gains DR 5/adamantine instead of DR 5/chaotic.</p>
			<p>This alters eidolon.</p>
			<p><b>Life Link (Su): </b>At 1st level, a summoner forms a close bond with his eidolon. Whenever the eidolon takes enough damage to send it back to its home plane, as a reaction to the damage, the summoner can sacrifice any number of hit points he has without using an action. Each hit point sacrificed in this way prevents 1 point of damage dealt to the eidolon. This can prevent the eidolon from being sent back to its home plane.</p>
			<p>In addition, the eidolon and the summoner must remain within 100 feet of one another for the eidolon to remain at full strength. If the eidolon is beyond 100 feet but closer than 1,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 50%. If the eidolon is more than 1,000 feet away but closer than 10,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 75%. If the eidolon is more than 10,000 feet away, it is immediately returned to its home plane. Current hit points lost in this way are not restored when the eidolon gets closer to its summoner, but its maximum hit point total does climb to the levels indicated and eventually returns to normal.</p>
			<p><b>Bond Senses (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a summoner can, as a standard action, share the senses of his eidolon, hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and touching everything the eidolon does. He can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to his summoner level. There is no maximum range to this effect, but the eidolon and the summoner must be on the same plane. The summoner can end this effect as a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Planar Tinkering (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a construct caller learns to better shape planar energy to improve her eidolon. The number of points in her eidolon&#146;s evolution pool increases by 1. The number of points in the eidolon&#146;s evolution pool increases by an additional 1 at 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter, for a total of 5 additional points at 19th level.</p>
			<p>This replaces summon monster I.</p>
			<p><b>Shield Ally (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a summoner is within his eidolon&#146;s reach, the summoner gains a +2 shield bonus to his Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on his saving throws. This bonus does not apply if the eidolon is grappled, helpless, paralyzed, stunned, or unconscious.</p>
			<p><b>Maker&#146;s Call (Su): </b>At 6th level, as a standard action, a summoner can call his eidolon to his side. This functions as dimension door, using the summoner&#146;s caster level. When this ability is used, the eidolon appears adjacent to the summoner (or as close as possible if all adjacent spaces are occupied). If the eidolon is out of range, the ability is wasted. The summoner can use this ability once per day at 6th level, plus one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 6th.</p>
			<p><b>Transposition (Su): </b>At 8th level, a summoner can use his maker&#146;s call ability to swap locations with his eidolon. If the eidolon occupies more squares than the summoner, the summoner can appear in any square occupied by the eidolon. The eidolon must occupy the square that was occupied by the summoner if able, or as close as possible if it is not able.</p>
			<p><b>Aspect (Su): </b>At 10th level, a summoner can divert up to 2 points from his eidolon&#146;s evolution pool to add evolutions to himself. He cannot select any evolution that the eidolon could not possess, and he must be able to meet the requirements as well (except for subtype requirements, so long as his eidolon meets the subtype requirement). He cannot select the ability increase evolution through this ability. Any points spent in this way are taken from the eidolon&#146;s evolution pool (reducing the total number available to the eidolon). The summoner can change the evolutions granted by these points anytime he can change the eidolon&#146;s evolutions.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Shield Ally (Su): </b>At 12th level, whenever an ally is within reach of the summoner&#146;s eidolon, the ally gains a +2 shield bonus to its Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on its saving throws. If this ally is the summoner, these bonuses increase to +4. This bonus does not apply if the eidolon is grappled, helpless, paralyzed, stunned, or unconscious.</p>
			<p><b>Life Bond (Su): </b>At 14th level, the summoner&#146;s life becomes linked to his eidolon&#146;s. As long as the eidolon has 1 or more hit points, the summoner is protected from harm. Damage in excess of that which would reduce the summoner to 0 hit points is instead transferred to the eidolon. This damage is transferred 1 point at a time, meaning that as soon as the eidolon is reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to its Constitution score, all excess damage remains with the summoner. Effects that cause death but don&#146;t deal damage are unaffected by this ability. This ability does not affect spells such as baleful polymorph, flesh to stone, imprisonment, or other spells that don&#146;t deal damage.</p>
			<p><b>Merge Forms (Su): </b>At 16th level, as a full-round action, a summoner can touch his eidolon and the two can merge forms. This transformation includes all of the summoner&#146;s gear. While merged in this way, the summoner is protected from harm and cannot be the target of spells or effects. All effects and spells currently targeting the summoner are suspended until the summoner emerges from the eidolon (although durations continue to expire).</p>
			<p>The summoner can cast spells while inside the eidolon by taking control of the eidolon for the duration of the casting. Any material components used for these spells are taken from the summoner&#146;s gear, even though they are otherwise inaccessible. The summoner can direct all of the eidolon&#146;s actions while merged, can perceive through its senses, and can speak through its voice.</p>
			<p>The summoner can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his summoner level. He can end this effect at any time as a swift action. The summoner emerges in a square adjacent to the eidolon if able. If the eidolon is returned to its home plane while the summoner is merged with it, the summoner is immediately ejected, takes 4d6 points of damage, and is stunned for 1 round.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Aspect (Su): </b>At 18th level, a summoner can divert more of his eidolon&#146;s evolutions to himself. This ability functions as the aspect ability, but the maximum number of evolution points the summoner can divert increases to 6. In addition, the eidolon loses 1 point from its evolution pool for every 2 points (or fraction thereof ) diverted to the summoner instead of losing 1 point from the evolution pool for each point diverted.</p>
			<p><b>Twin Eidolon (Su) </b>: At 20th level, a summoner and his eidolon share a true connection. As a standard action, the summoner can assume the shape of his eidolon, copying all of its evolutions, form, and abilities. His Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores change to match the base scores of his eidolon. He can choose to have any gear that he carries become absorbed by his new form, as with spells from the polymorph subschool. Items with continuous effects continue to function while absorbed in this way. The summoner loses his natural attacks and all racial traits (except bonus feats, skills, and languages) in favor of the abilities granted by his eidolon&#146;s evolutions. The summoner retains all of his class features. The summoner can keep this form for a number of minutes per day equal to his summoner level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The summoner can end this effect as a free action.</p>
