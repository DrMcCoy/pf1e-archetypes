					<p>A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>

					<p>Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>

				<name type="string">Nature bond</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
					<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>

					<p>A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>

				<name type="string">Wild empathy</name>

					<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the beast shape I spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
					<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
					<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as beast shape II . When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as elemental body I.</p>
					<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature.

					<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>-</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex) </b>: Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that utilize or target plants, such as <i>blight </i>, <i>entangle </i>, <i>spike growth </i>, and <i>warp wood </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Venom Immunity (Ex) </b>: At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>

					<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, a skinshaper gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium humanoid and back again once per day. This ability functions as per alter self, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until the skinshaper changes back. Changing form is a standard action and doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity. The skinshaper must be familiar with the form she has chosen. She can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every 2 druid levels thereafter, up to a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, she can use skinshaping at will. The skinshaper learns to intuitively use her body as a weapon. While skinshaping, she gains the benefit of the Improved Unarmed Strike feat, and her unarmed strike deals damage as if she were a monk with a monk level equal to her druid level &#150; 3.</p>
					<p>At 6th level, a skinshaper gains the ability to channel the versatile nature of humanoids to enhance her body and mind. Whenever she uses skinshaping to assume a humanoid shape other than her own, she gains a +2 enhancement bonus to any one ability score. The bonus persists as long as she remains in that form. At 10th, 14th, and 18th levels, she gains an additional +2 enhancement bonus to one ability score. She can distribute these bonuses as she wishes in increments of +2, but the enhancement bonus on any single ability score cannot exceed +4.</p>
					<p>At 8th level, a skinshaper can imitate humanoid creatures even more accurately. She gains any of the following abilities that the form she assumes has: darkvision 90 feet, low-light vision, scent, climb 60 feet, fly 60 feet (good maneuverability), swim 60 feet, ferocity, orc ferocity, and hold breath. If the form she assumes has the aquatic subtype, she gains the aquatic subtype and the amphibious special quality.</p>
					<p>At 12th level, a skinshaper can access the racial memory of the humanoid she is imitating. If the form she assumes has any of the following racial abilities, she gains those abilities: defensive training, hatred, poison use, sneak attack +2d6, stability, and weapon familiarity. Additionally, she can speak any racial languages of the chosen form.</p>
					<p>At 16th level, a skinshaper gains the racial skill bonuses of the imitated humanoid, to a maximum of a +4 bonus on a given skill.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Using the same primal energy with which other druids assume animal forms, skinshapers can imitate some of the most dangerous beasts of all: humans and other humanoids. Rather than merely copying humanoids&#146; shapes and abilities, skinshapers unlock brutal energies that push their borrowed bodies far beyond the capabilities of normal humanoid creatures. Their connection to humanoids bring skinshapers into settlements more often than typical druids, and their penchant for disguise allows them to excel at intrigue.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex) </b>: Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that utilize or target plants, such as <i>blight </i>, <i>entangle </i>, <i>spike growth </i>, and <i>warp wood </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Skinshaping (Su): </b>At 4th level, a skinshaper gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium humanoid and back again once per day. This ability functions as per alter self, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until the skinshaper changes back. Changing form is a standard action and doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity. The skinshaper must be familiar with the form she has chosen. She can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every 2 druid levels thereafter, up to a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, she can use skinshaping at will. The skinshaper learns to intuitively use her body as a weapon. While skinshaping, she gains the benefit of the Improved Unarmed Strike feat, and her unarmed strike deals damage as if she were a monk with a monk level equal to her druid level &#150; 3.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a skinshaper gains the ability to channel the versatile nature of humanoids to enhance her body and mind. Whenever she uses skinshaping to assume a humanoid shape other than her own, she gains a +2 enhancement bonus to any one ability score. The bonus persists as long as she remains in that form. At 10th, 14th, and 18th levels, she gains an additional +2 enhancement bonus to one ability score. She can distribute these bonuses as she wishes in increments of +2, but the enhancement bonus on any single ability score cannot exceed +4.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a skinshaper can imitate humanoid creatures even more accurately. She gains any of the following abilities that the form she assumes has: darkvision 90 feet, low-light vision, scent, climb 60 feet, fly 60 feet (good maneuverability), swim 60 feet, ferocity, orc ferocity, and hold breath. If the form she assumes has the aquatic subtype, she gains the aquatic subtype and the amphibious special quality.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a skinshaper can access the racial memory of the humanoid she is imitating. If the form she assumes has any of the following racial abilities, she gains those abilities: defensive training, hatred, poison use, sneak attack +2d6, stability, and weapon familiarity. Additionally, she can speak any racial languages of the chosen form.</p>
			<p>At 16th level, a skinshaper gains the racial skill bonuses of the imitated humanoid, to a maximum of a +4 bonus on a given skill. The skinshaper cannot benefit from any variable racial skill bonuses associated with the chosen form (such as gnomes&#146; racial bonus on any one Craft or Profession skill).</p>
			<p><b>Venom Immunity (Ex) </b>: At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>
			<p><b>Flashmorph (Su): </b>At 13th level, a skinshaper learns to change her shape extremely quickly. She can use skinshaping as a swift action.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 6th level, a shark shaman&#146;s wild shape ability functions at her druid level &#150;2. If she takes on the form of a shark, she instead uses her druid level +2.</p>
					<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the beast shape I spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
					<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
					<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as beast shape II . When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as elemental body I.</p>
					<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some druids emulate the deadly shark, a remorseless hunter that marine dwellers dread. Like a true shark, a shark shaman leaves blood and fear in her wake.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: A shark shaman who chooses an animal companion must select a shark. If choosing a domain, a shark shaman may choose the Animal, Death, War, or Water domain.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A shark shaman can use wild empathy with fish as a full-round action with a +4 bonus.</p>
			<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Totem Transformation (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a shark shaman may adopt an aspect of the shark while retaining her normal form. This ability functions as the dragon shaman&#146;s totem transformation ability, but the druid may select from the following bonuses: movement (can breathe water, swim speed 30 feet), senses (scent 30 feet, scent 90 feet in water), natural weapons (bite 1d6 for a Medium shaman), or shark skin (+2 natural armor, creatures grappling the shaman take 1 point of slashing damage per round of grapple). While using totem transformation, the shark shaman may speak normally and can cast speak with animals (fish only) at will.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex) </b>: Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that utilize or target plants, such as <i>blight </i>, <i>entangle </i>, <i>spike growth </i>, and <i>warp wood </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Totemic Summons (Su): </b>At 5th level, a shark shaman may use summon nature&#146;s ally I to summon a stingray and summon nature&#146;s ally II to summon a manta ray. She may cast summon nature&#146;s ally as a standard action when summoning rays and sharks, and summond rays and sharks gain a number of temporary hit points equal to her druid level. This ability otherwise functions as the dragon shaman&#146;s totemic summons ability.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su): </b>At 6th level, a shark shaman&#146;s wild shape ability functions at her druid level &#150;2. If she takes on the form of a shark, she instead uses her druid level +2.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the beast shape I spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as beast shape II . When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as elemental body I .</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as beast shape III . When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as elemental body II . When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as plant shape I .</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as elemental body III . When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as plant shape II .</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as elemental body IV . When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as plant shape III .</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat: </b>At 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter, a shark shaman gains one of the following bonus feats: Bleeding Critical, Improved Initiative, Lightning Reflexes, Self-Sufficient, or Skill Focus (Swim). She must meet prerequisites for these bonus feats. This ability replaces venom immunity.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>While all druids traverse the wilderness with ease, the world walkers take it upon themselves to travel the entire world. Some act as messengers and scouts for druidic circles, while others have a seemingly unquenchable wanderlust; each new land provides new mysteries to discover and new wisdom to be gained from mastering those mysteries.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, the world walker gains the ranger&#146;s favored terrain ability. She treats her druid level as her ranger level for this ability. If she has levels in both classes, both class&#146;s levels stack for determining the effect of this ability. This ability replaces trackless step and reduce nature&#146;s lore.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Path of Trees (Su): </b>At 9th level, once a day, a wanderer can step within a tree and then teleport from that tree to another one in a manner similar to the tree stride spell. She gains an extra use of this ability each day at 12th level, and a third use of this ability at 15th level. Furthermore, a world walker of 13th level or higher can use this ability to teleport to any other tree of its type up to 100 miles away. This ability replaces both venom immunity and timeless body.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A shaman with this totem calls upon the clever wolf, capable of roaming alone yet wise enough to run with a pack when facing dangers too great for one alone.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: A wolf shaman who chooses an animal companion must select a wolf. If choosing a domain, the wolf shaman must choose from the Animal, Community, Liberation, and Travel domains.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A wolf shaman can use wild empathy with canines as a full-round action with a +4 bonus.</p>
			<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Totem Transformation (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a wolf shaman may adopt an aspect of the wolf while retaining her normal form. This ability functions as the bear shaman ability, but the druid may select from the following bonuses: movement (+20 enhancement bonus to land speed), senses (low-light vision, scent, +4 racial bonus to Survival when tracking by scent), or natural weapons (bite [1d4 plus trip] for a Medium druid, +2 CMB to trip). While using totem transformation, the wolf shaman may speak normally and can cast speak with animals (canines only) at will.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex) </b>: Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that utilize or target plants, such as <i>blight </i>, <i>entangle </i>, <i>spike growth </i>, and <i>warp wood </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Totemic Summons (Su): </b>At 5th level, a wolf shaman may cast summon nature&#146;s ally as a standard action when summoning canines, and these summoned creatures gain temporary hit points equal to her druid level. This ability otherwise functions as the bear shaman ability.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 6th level, a wolf shaman&#146;s wild shape ability functions at her druid level &#150; 2. If she takes on the form of a canine, she instead uses her druid level + 2.</p>
			<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat: </b>At 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter, a wolf shaman gains one of the following bonus feats: Greater Trip, Improved Trip, Mobility, Skill Focus (Stealth), or Spring Attack. She must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats. This ability replaces venom immunity.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel.

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>

The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>

Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
					<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
					<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as beast shape II . When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as elemental body I.</p>
					<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as beast shape III . When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as elemental body II. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as plant shape I .</p>
					<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as elemental body III . When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as plant shape II .</p>
					<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as elemental body IV . When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as plant shape III .</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A wild whisperer is an expert at studying, predicting, and explaining animal behavior. She is less interested in plants, fey, and other aspects of the natural world, and uses her gifts to tame or relocate dangerous beasts and soothe the hurts of wounded and sickly creatures.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a wild whisperer gains an inspiration pool as the investigator class ability (see page 31). A wild whisperer uses her druid level as her investigator level when determining the effects of this ability. Instead of free uses of inspiration on Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks, the wild whisperer can use inspiration on Handle Animal, Heal, Knowledge (geography), Knowledge (nature), Ride, Sense Motive, and Survival skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided she&#146;s trained in the relevant skill. She can also use inspiration on any wild empathy check without expending a use of inspiration. A wild whisperer&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day when she prepares spells. This ability replaces woodland stride, trackless step, and resist nature&#146;s lure.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>At 4th level, a wild whisperer gains the wild shape ability, but she never gains access to any forms beyond Small and Medium animal forms, as beast shape I. This ability alters wild shape.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Natural Expertise (Ex): </b>At 6th level, a wild whisperer&#146;s powers of observation give her an advantage when she&#146;s fighting natural creatures. When using inspiration on an attack roll against an animal or a vermin or on a saving throw against an effect from an animal or a vermin, a wild whisperer has to expend only one use of inspiration instead of two. This ability replaces the additional use of wild shape at 6th level.</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talent: </b>At 8th level, wild whisperer selects an investigator talent (see page 32). This ability replaces the additional use of wild shape at 8th level.</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talents: </b>The following investigator talents complement the wild whisperer archetype: amazing inspiration, effortless aid, eidetic recollection, empathy, inspirational expertise, inspired alertness, inspired intimidator, perceptive tracking, tenacious inspiration.</p>
			<p><b>Venom Immunity (Ex) </b>: At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

					<p>Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>

				<name type="string">Toxic Secretions</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, an urushiol&#146;s body becomes capable of producing a single dose of poison per day. At 3rd level and every 2 druid levels thereafter, the number of daily doses increases by 1, to a maximum of 10 doses at 19th level. The urushiol&#146;s daily doses are replenished when he regains his spells, but any of his weapons that are still poisoned with urushiol venom count against his daily limit. The urushiol is immune to his own poison and cannot accidentally poison himself when applying his own poison or attacking with a weapon coated with it. Regardless of the delivery method he chooses, his poison has the following base statistics.</p>
					<p><i>Urushiol Venom: </i>type poison (varies); save Fortitude negates; frequency 1/round for 2 rounds; effect 1d3 Strength damage; cure 1 save. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the urushiol&#146;s level + his Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>At 1st level, an urushiol can secrete this poison as a numbing injury poison on a natural weapon, unarmed strike, or manufactured weapon by spending 1 of his daily doses as a standard action. He must choose a natural weapon, unarmed strike, or manufactured weapon in his hand that deals piercing or slashing damage and that is not already poisoned or poisonous. The weapon remains poisoned until the urushiol scores a hit with it, the weapon leaves his possession for more than 1 round, or the poison is wiped away.</p>
					<p>At 4th level, an urushiol&#146;s body becomes so saturated with poison that even his flesh is poisonous. Whenever a creature damages the urushiol with a bite or swallow whole attack, the urushiol can release ingested poison into the creature by spending 1 of his daily doses as an immediate action.</p>
					<p>At 7th level, an urushiol can spend 2 daily doses of his poison as a standard action to secrete a contact poison and coat one of his limbs with the secreted poison. The urushiol can deliver the poison by making a successful touch attack as a standard action, which can be part of the same standard action he used to secrete the poison. If the attack misses, the poison persists upon his limb throughout the subsequent rounds until he hits a target or touches something else with his poisoned limb.</p>
					<p>At 11th level, an urushiol can spend 3 daily doses of his poison as a standard action to release a 20-foot-radius cloud of inhaled poison centered around him that lasts for 1 round.</p>
					<p>At 14th level, an urushiol&#146;s venom changes in frequency to 1/round for 4 rounds. In addition, when using his urushiol venom, an urushiol can spend an extra dose of his poison to change the damage type of the poison to Dexterity damage or Constitution damage. He can use this alteration in combination with any of the other abilities. For example, he could spend a total of 3 doses to create a cloud of inhaled poison that deals Constitution damage.</p>

					<p>A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>

					<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type.

Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>When an urushiol druid forms a bond with nature, it takes a vastly different form than for most druids. His body becomes increasingly toxic, allowing him to secrete a deadly poison through his pores.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Toxic Secretions (Su): </b>At 1st level, an urushiol&#146;s body becomes capable of producing a single dose of poison per day. At 3rd level and every 2 druid levels thereafter, the number of daily doses increases by 1, to a maximum of 10 doses at 19th level. The urushiol&#146;s daily doses are replenished when he regains his spells, but any of his weapons that are still poisoned with urushiol venom count against his daily limit. The urushiol is immune to his own poison and cannot accidentally poison himself when applying his own poison or attacking with a weapon coated with it. Regardless of the delivery method he chooses, his poison has the following base statistics.</p>
			<p><i>Urushiol Venom: type poison (varies); </i>save Fortitude negates; frequency 1/round for 2 rounds; effect 1d3 Strength damage; cure 1 save. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the urushiol&#146;s level + his Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, an urushiol can secrete this poison as a numbing injury poison on a natural weapon, unarmed strike, or manufactured weapon by spending 1 of his daily doses as a standard action. He must choose a natural weapon, unarmed strike, or manufactured weapon in his hand that deals piercing or slashing damage and that is not already poisoned or poisonous. The weapon remains poisoned until the urushiol scores a hit with it, the weapon leaves his possession for more than 1 round, or the poison is wiped away.</p>
			<p>At 4th level, an urushiol&#146;s body becomes so saturated with poison that even his flesh is poisonous. Whenever a creature damages the urushiol with a bite or swallow whole attack, the urushiol can release ingested poison into the creature by spending 1 of his daily doses as an immediate action.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, an urushiol can spend 2 daily doses of his poison as a standard action to secrete a contact poison and coat one of his limbs with the secreted poison. The urushiol can deliver the poison by making a successful touch attack as a standard action, which can be part of the same standard action he used to secrete the poison. If the attack misses, the poison persists upon his limb throughout the subsequent rounds until he hits a target or touches something else with his poisoned limb.</p>
			<p>At 11th level, an urushiol can spend 3 daily doses of his poison as a standard action to release a 20-foot-radius cloud of inhaled poison centered around him that lasts for 1 round.</p>
			<p>At 14th level, an urushiol&#146;s venom changes in frequency to 1/round for 4 rounds. In addition, when using his urushiol venom, an urushiol can spend an extra dose of his poison to change the damage type of the poison to Dexterity damage or Constitution damage. He can use this alteration in combination with any of the other abilities. For example, he could spend a total of 3 doses to create a cloud of inhaled poison that deals Constitution damage.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Venom Immunity (Ex) : </b>At 4th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

					<p>A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

					<p>An urban druid gains this ability at 8th level, except that her effective druid level for the ability is equal to her druid level &#150; 4.</p>
					<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the beast shape I spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>While many druids keep to the wilderness, some make their way within settlements, communing with the animals and vermin who live there and speaking for the nature that runs rampant in civilization&#146;s very cradle.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: An urban druid can channel stored spell energy into domain spells that she has not prepared ahead of time. She can &#147;lose&#148; a prepared spell in order to cast any domain spell of the same level or lower. This ability replaces the ability to spontaneously cast summon nature&#146;s ally spells.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: An urban druid may not select an animal companion. Instead, she must choose from the following domains, rather than those usually available to druids: Charm, Community, Knowledge, Nobility, Protection, Repose, Rune, or Weather.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Lorekeeper (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, an urban druid adds Diplomacy, Knowledge (history), Knowledge (local), and Knowledge (nobility) skills to her list of class skills. She also receives a +2 bonus on these skill checks. This ability replaces a druid&#146;s woodland stride and trackless step abilities.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Temptation (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an urban druid gains a +2 bonus on saves vs. divinations and enchantments. This replaces the resist nature&#146;s lure ability.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su): </b>An urban druid gains this ability at 6th level. A druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the alter self spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su): </b>An urban druid gains this ability at 8th level, except that her effective druid level for the ability is equal to her druid level &#150; 4.</p>
			<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the beast shape I spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as beast shape II . When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as elemental body I.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as beast shape III . When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as elemental body II. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as plant shape I .</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as elemental body III . When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as plant shape II .</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as elemental body IV . When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as plant shape III .</p>
			<p><b>Mental Strength (Ex): </b>At 9th level, an urban druid gains immunity to charm and compulsion effects. This ability replaces venom immunity.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

				<level type="number">1</level>
				<name type="string">Nature bond</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting an undine adept who chooses a domain must choose the Community or Water domain, or any subdomain of those domains. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
					<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>An undine adept dedicates herself to preserving the knowledge of the first undines and ensuring her people&#146;s ancient connections to the natural world remain undisturbed. They serve as the keepers of the roots of the undine people and as their protectors. An undine adept has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<p><b>Race: </b>Undine Only</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. An undine adept who chooses a domain must choose the Community or Water domain, or any subdomain of those domains.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Amphibious (Su): </b>At 2nd level, the undine adept gains the aquatic subtype and the amphibious universal monster ability, allowing her to breathe water or air. This ability replaces woodland stride.</p>
			<p><b>Augment Summoning (Su): </b>At 3rd level, any creature with the water subtype the undine adept summons with either summon monster or summon nature&#146;s ally gains the benefits of the Augment Summoning feat. This replaces trackless step.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Water&#146;s Call (Su): </b>At 4th level, an undine adept gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of outsiders with the aquatic or water subtype, fey with the aquatic or water subtype, and spells and effects with the water descriptor. This ability replaces resist nature&#146;s lure.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, an undine adept gains the ability to use wild shape. When an undine takes the form of a creature with the aquatic or water subtype, this ability functions at her class level + 1. For all other forms, her effective druid level for the ability is equal to her actual undine adept level. This ability otherwise functions as and replaces wild shape.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Commune with Water Spirits: </b>At 9th level, an undine adept adds commune to her druid spell list. She may use this spell whether she worships a deity or elemental forces. This ability replaces venom immunity.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Troll furies combine a druid&#146;s love of natural balance with a single-minded devotion to the welfare of the troll tribe. Trolls require a lot of prey to keep fed, and if their hunting grounds are upset by incursions of other monsters, civilized deforestation, or careless trolls who eat more than they need, a troll tribe can find itself without a sustainable food source.</i></p>
			<p><i>Troll furies take the long view on sustainability, protecting the trolls&#146; territory from gluttonous trolls and outsiders alike, and even hunting down tribal enemies when necessary. Holding themselves aloof from the rest of troll society, troll furies command great respect and can rally a region&#146;s trolls quickly to deal with threats to their existence and the health of their environment.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<p><b>Race: </b>Troll Only</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Inspire Fervor (Ex): </b>At 1st level, once per day as a standard action, a troll fury can chant over another troll within 30 feet, bolstering it against fear and improving its combat abilities. This works like the inspire courage bard ability, but affects only one troll and lasts 1 minute. The troll fury uses her druid level as her bard level to determine the effects of this ability. This ability replaces wild empathy.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Chosen Prey (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a troll fury can select one creature type from the ranger&#146;s favored enemy list and gains a favored enemy bonus against that creature type with an effective ranger level equal to her druid level. This ability never grants the troll fury favored enemy bonuses against a second favored enemy creature type. A troll fury can change her favored enemy type once per week by performing a ritual that takes 1 hour to perform. If a troll fury already has a favored enemy from another class, the levels from the classes that grant favored enemies stack with this one to determine the favored enemy bonuses, and in this case she can gain other favored enemy creature types. This ability replaces resist nature&#146;s lure.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Troll Fury&#146;s Mark (Su): </b>At 9th level, each time a troll fury or her animal companion damages a creature with a natural attack, the troll fury gains a +10 insight bonus on Survival checks to track that creature for 24 hours. The duration of this ability does not stack with itself. Each time the troll fury or her animal companion hits the target, this ability lasts for the next 24 hours. This ability replaces venom immunity.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

A treesinger who selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot, and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with a plant companion. A treesinger may begin play with any of the plants listed in Plant Companions. This plant is a loyal companion that accompanies the treesinger on her adventures. Except for the companion being a creature of the plant type, drawn from the list of plant companions, this ability otherwise works like the standard druid&#146;s animal companion ability.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Elves live far longer than other common races, and a single elf may see whole empires rise and fall. Given the impermanence of the cultures around them, it&#146;s small wonder that some elves turn to the timeless growth of nature for solace, finding allies among the great trees themselves, and even leading the forest&#146;s plants into combat. A treesinger has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<p><b>Race: </b>Elf Olny</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Plant Bond (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a treesinger forms a mystic bond with plant life. This bond can take one of two forms. The first grants the treesinger one of the following domains: Plant (Core Rulebook); Growth ; Jungle, Swamp. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the treesinger&#146;s effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A treesinger who selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot, and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with a plant companion. A treesinger may begin play with any of the plants listed in Plant Companions. This plant is a loyal companion that accompanies the treesinger on her adventures. Except for the companion being a creature of the plant type, drawn from the list of plant companions, this ability otherwise works like the standard druid&#146;s animal companion ability.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex) </b>: Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that utilize or target plants, such as <i>blight </i>, <i>entangle </i>, <i>spike growth </i>, and <i>warp wood </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Venom Immunity (Ex) </b>: At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

				<level type="number">1</level>
				<name type="string">Nature bond</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
					<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the beast shape I spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
					<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Druids protect the natural environs of the world, and sometimes that requires forcibly expelling those who would pollute, despoil, or otherwise harm such areas. Single battles may not be enough to win the war, so some druids specialize in the stealthy application of insidious poisons to their targets. In the verdant depths of the Mwangi Expanse or the Valashmai Jungle of Tian Xia, many druids work to root out their enemies by means of powerful toxins, believing word of their foes&#146; horrifying deaths will deter others from attempting similar desecrations of the natural world.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Expanded Repertoire (Ex): </b>A toxicologist adds the following extracts and spells to her druid spell list as druid spells of the listed spell level: poisoned egg (1st level, Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Gods 238), transmute potion to poisonAPG (2nd level), stinking cloud (3rd level), toxic giftUM (4th level), and cloudkill (5th level). A toxicologist can channel stored spell energy only into summoning spells she has prepared ahead of time.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Natural Poison Lore (Ex): </b>A toxicologist has a deep understanding of and appreciation for poisons. At 2nd level, she cannot accidentally poison herself when applying poison to a weapon and cannot accidentally poison an animal companion or summoned creature when applying poison to its claws (though poison obviously should not be applied to a creature&#146;s bite).</p>
			<p><b>Expert Poisoner (Su): </b>At 4th level, a toxicologist increases the DCs of any spells she casts with the poison descriptor by 1.</p>
			<p><b>Toxic Shaper (Su): </b>A toxicologist never gains the ability to use wild shape to transform into an elemental or plant. At 8th level, a toxicologist can transform into a Small or Medium vermin. When she takes this form, her wild shape functions as vermin shape IUM. At 10th level, a toxicologist can transform into a tiny or large vermin. When she takes this form, her wild shape functions as vermin shape IIUM.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Venom Immunity (Ex) </b>: At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

					<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Druids draw upon the fiercest powers of nature, and tsunamis, typhoons, and whirlpools are among the most powerful forces in the ocean. Tempest tamers are at one with the water and gain the ability to soothe these dangerous phenomena. Tempest tamers can be found in many of Golarion&#146;s oceans, but all avoid the spectacular Eye of Abendego&#151;they are all keenly aware of the supernatural origin of that massive hurricane, and they know they cannot quell its fury without first acquiring extraordinary power.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Speech of the Sea: </b>A tempest tamer&#146;s bonus language options include Aquan and Auran, in addition to the bonus languages available to the character from her race. However, the tempest tamer does not gain Sylvan as a bonus language option.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Whirlpool Walker (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a tempest tamer can resist winds and the unnatural powers of sea creatures. The tempest tamer gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against spells with the air or water descriptor and the spell-like and supernatural abilities of creatures with the air, aquatic, or water subtype. This bonus also applies to saving throws to avoid damage from a vortex, whirlpool, or similar effects, as well as to saving throws to prevent being pulled into or moved by such effects.</p>
			<p><b>Tempest Wild Shape (Su): </b>At 4th level, a tempest tamer gains the ability to turn herself into a Small water elemental. This ability functions as per the elemental body I spell except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level or until she changes back. Changing form (to an elemental or back) is a standard action and doesn&#146;t provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a tempest tamer can use tempest wild shape to change into a Small air elemental.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a tempest tamer can use tempest wild shape to change into a Medium air or water elemental, as per elemental body II.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a tempest tamer can use tempest wild shape to change into a Large air or water elemental, as per elemental body III.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a tempest tamer can use tempest wild shape to change into a Huge air or water elemental, as per elemental body IV.</p>
			<p>A tempest tamer can use this ability once per day plus an additional time per day at 6th level and every 2 levels thereafter (up to a total of eight times at 18th level). At 20th level, she can use tempest wild shape at will.</p>
			<p><b>Venom Immunity (Ex) </b>: At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

					<p>At 9th level, a tempest druid can redirect nearby electrical attacks. As an immediate action, the druid can shift the area or target of an electricity attack by 5 feet in any direction. If the electricity affects an area, the druid selects one square to be unaffected and an adjacent square to be affected. If the adjacent square is already in the area, this has no additional effect in that square. If the electricity affects a target, the druid selects an adjacent target. For example, if he were in the line of a wizard&#146;s lightning bolt, he could have the spell skip his square and instead affect an adjacent square, even if this meant the spell did not form a continuous line. If another druid attacked him with call lightning, he could shift the called bolt to an adjacent square, affecting a creature in that square (if any).</p>
					<p>He can&#146;t redirect electricity damage conducted to him by physical contact with an object or creature (such as a shocking grasp or a shock weapon). He can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his Wisdom bonus.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Many of the druids who train under the aegis of the Storm Kindlers focus on different areas of nature than those classically paid homage to by their kind. These so-called tempest druids see the personification of nature in the fury of the storm alone and to some extent eschew the veneration of plant or animal life, and the nature of their powers shifts accordingly. They still understand the place of plants and animals in the natural order, however; they simply view such entities&#151;and indeed, all forms of life&#151;as subservient to the true power found in the storms that lash the world.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: The beliefs held by tempest druids are inherently more chaotic than those held by most druids, and as a result, tempest druids must be chaotic neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p>A tempest druid is proficient with the trident, in addition to the druid&#146;s normal armor and weapon proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A tempest druid can channel stored spell energy into domain spells that he has not prepared ahead of time. He can &#147;lose&#148; a prepared spell to cast any domain spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: As a result of his beliefs, a tempest druid has little connection to the spirituality of animals or plants. He can&#146;t choose an animal companion, and must instead select a domain or subdomain from the following list when he gains the nature bond ability: Air, Aquatic, Cloud, Storm, Swamp, Weather, or Wind.</p>
			<p><b>Sodden Shore Sense (Ex): </b>A tempest druid gains a +4 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks in coastal or marshy lands.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Electrical Resistance (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a tempest druid gains electricity resistance 5. As a standard action, he can transfer this resistance to another creature for 1 hour, after which time it reverts to him.</p>
			<p><b>Eyes of the Storm (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a tempest druid can see through 10 feet of magical fog, mist, rain, wind, or similar inclement weather conditions, ignoring any concealment such conditions might grant. This distance increases by 5 feet for every 4 levels beyond 4th.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Bend Bolt (Su): </b>At 9th level, a tempest druid can redirect nearby electrical attacks. As an immediate action, the druid can shift the area or target of an electricity attack by 5 feet in any direction. If the electricity affects an area, the druid selects one square to be unaffected and an adjacent square to be affected. If the adjacent square is already in the area, this has no additional effect in that square. If the electricity affects a target, the druid selects an adjacent target. For example, if he were in the line of a wizard&#146;s lightning bolt, he could have the spell skip his square and instead affect an adjacent square, even if this meant the spell did not form a continuous line. If another druid attacked him with call lightning, he could shift the called bolt to an adjacent square, affecting a creature in that square (if any).</p>
			<p>He can&#146;t redirect electricity damage conducted to him by physical contact with an object or creature (such as a shocking grasp or a shock weapon). He can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his Wisdom bonus.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

					<p>A swarm monger bonds with an urban familiar, treating her druid level as her wizard level for the purposes of determining her familiar&#146;s abilities. The swarm monger must select her familiar from the following options: cat, house centipedeUM, rat, raven, or scarlet spiderUM. The fecund familiar gains the benefits of its master&#146;s child of pollution, shadowy opportunist, and venom immunity class abilities.</p>
					<p>As a standard action, a swarm monger can cause her familiar to burst forth into a full swarm of identical creatures, filling four contiguous 5-foot squares and gaining temporary hit points equal to half its master&#146;s maximum hit points. While in swarm form, the familiar loses the improved evasion, share spells, deliver touch attack, and scry on familiar special abilities. It uses its normal AC, saving throws, and skill bonuses, and it gains the swarm subtype and the ability to make swarm attacks (dealing 1d6 points of damage at 1st level and using the swarm monger&#146;s druid level as the swarm&#146;s Hit Dice to determine damage increases as per the swarm subtype). The swarm monger is immune to her own familiar&#146;s swarm attack.</p>
					<p>Beginning at 5th level, any creature damaged by a fecund familiar&#146;s swarm attack must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the swarm monger&#146;s druid level + the swarm monger&#146;s Wisdom modifier) or be sickened for 1d6 rounds. At 12th level, creatures that fail their Fortitude saving throws instead become nauseated.</p>
					<p>A swarm monger can transform her familiar into a swarm a number of times each day equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), and the transformation lasts for 1 minute per druid level, or until the swarm monger reverts her familiar back to a singular form as a standard action. A fecund familiar cannot be reduced in size to Diminutive or smaller when in swarm form.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type.

Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Swarm mongers are unparalleled survivors, thriving on the filthy fringes of society. Whereas other druids commune with nature or even the spirit of a city, swarm mongers find beauty and strength in decay, and they draw their power from fungus, disease, and their own singular will to survive.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p><b>Shadowy Opportunist (Ex): </b>A swarm monger gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (local) and Stealth checks.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Shadowy Opportunist (Ex): </b>A swarm monger gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (local) and Stealth checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Low Friends (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a swarm monger gains Vermin HeartAPG as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Child of Pollution (Su): </b>Starting at 4th level, a swarm monger gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against disease and poisons, and she can eat spoiled or rotting food and drink without ill effect. Once per day for every 4 druid levels she has, a swarm monger can devour a handful of rotting food as a standard action to gain a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + her druid level that last for 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Venom Immunity (Ex) </b>: At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>
			<p><b>Swarm Shape (Su): </b>At 12th level, a swarm monger can use wild shape to transform into a swarm of vermin, functioning as swarm skinAPG, but not allowing her to split into more than one contiguous swarm. She doesn&#146;t leave her gear behind when she uses this ability, and she can revert to her mundane form normally.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some druids eschew pleasant glades and groves and instead seek out dank marshes, misty bogs and heaths, and trackless swamps as the place they call home and watch over with care, finding beauty and life in abundance in places few others would willingly enter.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex) </b>: Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that utilize or target plants, such as <i>blight </i>, <i>entangle </i>, <i>spike growth </i>, and <i>warp wood </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Venom Immunity (Ex) </b>: At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The survivor embodies the neutral aspect of the natural world and eschews druidic magic in favor of more pragmatic and worldly survival methods.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<p><b>Diminished Spellcasting: </b>A survivor&#146;s number of spells per day for each spell level is one less than normal (for example, a 4th-level survivor can cast three cantrips, two 2nd-level spells, and one 1st-level spell per day). If this reduces the number of spells for a level to 0, she gains only the bonus spells for that level she would be entitled to based on her Wisdom score.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a survivor must select an animal companion as her nature bond.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Element of Surprise (Ex): </b>At 4th level, if a survivor makes a successful attack during a surprise round against a target that is unaware of her, her victim takes a penalty on its initiative check during the following round equal to half the damage dealt by the survivor&#146;s attack (minimum 0, maximum equal to the survivor&#146;s class level). This cannot reduce an initiative result below 1. This ability replaces resist nature&#146;s lure.</p>
			<p><b>Trap: </b>At 4th level, a survivor learns how to create a snare trap (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 65) and one other ranger trap of her choice (see page 25 or Ultimate Magic 64). At 6th level and every 2 levels thereafter, she learns another trap. The survivor can use these traps a total number of times per day equal to 1/2 her druid level + her Wisdom modifier. Once a trap is learned, it can&#146;t be unlearned and replaced with a different type of trap. The survivor cannot select an individual trap more than once. This ability replaces wild shape.</p>
			<p><b>Launch Trap: </b>At 9th level, a survivor can affix a magical ranger trap to an arrow or thrown weapon, allowing her to set the trap remotely or use it as a direct attack. Attaching the trap to the projectile is part of the full-round action of creating a new trap. The trapped projectile is fired or thrown in the normal manner. If the projectile is fired at a square, the trap is treated as if the survivor had set the trap in that square, except the DC is 5 lower than normal. If the projectile is fired at a creature, the target takes damage from the ranged weapon and is treated as if it had triggered the trap (saving throw applies, if any). The attack has a maximum range of 60 feet, and range increments apply to the attack roll. The duration of the trapped projectile starts from when it is created, not from when it is used. This ability replaces venom immunity.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Supernaturalists wholly embrace paranormal phenomena as extensions of nature.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Eldritch Botanist (Ex): </b>A supernaturalist can affect plants with mind-affecting effects she creates and with spells that normally affect animals. Any such spell that allows a Will save can instead be negated by the target plant with a successful Fortitude save at the same DC. She also can choose plant bond and green empathy, as a treesinger druid (Advanced Race Guide 25), in place of nature bond and wild empathy.</p>
			<p><b>Paranormal Scholar (Ex): </b>A supernaturalist gains Psychic SensitivityOA as a bonus feat and adds Diplomacy, Knowledge (arcana), and Sense Motive as class skills. At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, she can select a spell from the psychic class&#146;s spell list (Occult Adventures 69) and add it to her druid spell list, and is able to prepare and cast it as a druid spell. This replaces nature sense, trackless step, and resist nature&#146;s lure.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Animal Spirit (Su): </b>At 4th level, a supernaturalist can perform a seance to call an animal spirit of any animal with which she is familiar to serve as her companion and guide. The supernaturalist gains spirit, spirit bonus, spirit surge, and taboo abilities as a medium (Occult Adventures 30) 3 levels lower than her druid level. The supernaturalist&#146;s allies cannot participate in this seance. This ability replaces wild shape. The spirit abilities of the animal spirit are as follows.</p>
			<p><i>Spirit Bonus: </i>Your spirit bonus applies on attack and damage rolls with natural weapons and on skill checks relating to animals and plants.</p>
			<p><i>Seance Boon: </i>Your natural armor bonus to AC increases by 1.</p>
			<p><i>Favored Location: </i>Native terrain of the animal type being invoked.</p>
			<p><i>Influence Penalty: </i>You become wild and savage, taking a penalty equal to your spirit bonus on caster level checks, Charisma- and Intelligencebased ability checks, and skill checks.</p>
			<p><i>Taboos: </i>Choose one: you must not speak (except with animals and plants); you must not wield manufactured weapons; you must not eat anything you did not kill or harvest yourself.</p>
			<p><i>Totem Transformation (Lesser, Su): </i>You gain any of the following abilities possessed by the animal you select as your animal spirit: bite (1d6 for a Medium druid), 2 claws (1d4 for a Medium druid), darkvision, improved land movement speed (up to a +20-foot enhancement bonus to the druid&#146;s base land movement speed), low-light vision, scent, and swim (up to 30 feet).</p>
			<p><i>Pack Leader (Intermediate, Su): </i>When you summon animals that match your animal spirit, they gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws.</p>
			<p><i>Wildstrike (Greater, Su): </i>You can allow your animal spirit to gain 1 point of influence over you as a swift action to allow an animal or plant (including your companion) within 30 feet that can see or hear you to immediately take an additional standard action.</p>
			<p><i>Wild Heart (Supreme, Ex): </i>You gain a +4 bonus on saves against enchantment and mind-affecting effects, and immunity to effects that affect only humanoids. Once per day, you can cast any summon nature&#146;s ally spell you can cast spontaneously as a standard action without expending a spell slot.</p>
			<p><b>Venom Immunity (Ex) </b>: At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Sunriders help their allies, be they fellow tribe members or fellow adventurers, to survive in harsh desert terrain, while simultaneously making it even harsher for their foes. They seem to share a single mind with their loyal steeds, and companions who ride with them become an eerily wellcoordinated cavalry unit that traverses the treacherous desert sands with ease to wreak havoc upon invaders. Sunriders almost never leave their tribal homelands; those found outside Al-Zabrit are usually either exiles or emissaries sent to deal with issues that can&#146;t be addressed from their holds.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Born to the Saddle (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, while wearing light or no armor, a sunrider does not need to attempt Ride checks for any task listed in the Ride skill with a DC of 15 or lower. She does not take an armor check penalty on Ride checks while riding her mount.</p>
			<p><b>Mounted Advantage (Su): </b>At 3rd level, any allied mount within 30 feet of a sunrider can ignore the effects of rocky or sandy difficult terrain.</p>
			<p><b>Concerted Effort (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a sunrider can extend the bond she shares with her horse to other nearby mounted companions, forming them into a fighting force that seems to share a single mind. Allied mounts within 60 feet of the sunrider gain evasion as per the animal companion special ability. At 6th level, the range expands to 90 feet and allied mounts gain a +10-foot enhancement bonus to their speed. At 8th level, the range expands to 120 feet and allied mounts gain devotion as per the animal companion special ability. At 10th level, allied mounts gain multiattack as per the animal companion special ability. At 12th level, allied mounts gain a +2 bonus on saving throws. At 14th level, allied mounts gain a +20-foot enhancement bonus to their speed. At 16th level, allied mounts gain improved evasion as per the animal companion special ability. At 18th level, allied mounts gain a +2 dodge bonus to their Armor Class and a +2 bonus on attack rolls. At 20th level, allied mounts gain DR 5/&#151; and energy resistance 10 to acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic damage. These abilities function only while allied mounts are within range of the sunrider (her own mount always counts as an ally).</p>
			<p><b>Desert Born (Ex): </b>A sunrider is at home in the desert. At 4th level, she gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and on Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks while she is in desert terrain. Mounted allies traveling with her likewise gain a +1 bonus on initiative checks and Perception and Survival checks while in desert terrain, as long as they are within 30 feet of the sunrider.</p>
			<p><b>Venom Immunity (Ex) </b>: At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>While most druids focus their attention upon the rich earth and the bounty of nature that springs forth from it, the storm druid&#146;s eyes have ever been cast to the skies and the endless expanse of blue, channeling the most raw and untamed aspects of nature.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Domain Casting: </b>A storm druid can channel stored spell energy into domain spells that she has not prepared ahead of time. She can &#147;lose&#148; a prepared spell in order to cast any domain spell of the same level or lower. This replaces spontaneous casting.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: A storm druid may not choose an animal companion. A storm druid must choose the Air or Weather domain, or the Cloud, Storm, or Wind subdomain.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Windwalker (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, the penalties from natural or magical wind effects are treated as one step less severe for a storm druid. This ability replaces woodland stride.</p>
			<p><b>Stormvoice (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a storm druid&#146;s voice can magically carry over howling winds and peals of thunder. Whenever a Perception check is needed to hear the druid&#146;s voice, the DC is reduced by an amount equal to the druid&#146;s level. This ability replaces trackless step.</p>
			<p><b>Eyes of the Storm (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a storm druid can see through 10 feet of magical fog, mist, gas, wind, rain, or similar inclement weather conditions, ignoring any concealment it might grant. This distance increases by 5 feet for every 4 levels beyond 4th. This ability replaces resist nature&#146;s lure.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Windlord: </b>At 9th level, a storm druid can select another domain or subdomain from those available to her through her nature bond. This ability replaces venom immunity.</p>
			<p><b>Storm Lord (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a storm druid is unaffected by natural and magical wind effects. She also becomes immune to deafness and gains +2 bonus on saving throws against sonic effects. This ability replaces a thousand faces</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

					<p>At 1st level, a sky druid who chooses an animal companion must select one with a fly speed. If choosing a domain, the sky druid must choose from the Air, Animals, Liberation, and Weather domains, or subdomains appropriate to those domains.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
					<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>

					<p>A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>

					<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some druids develop ties not to a particular landscape, but instead to the endless blue expanse of the skies. Such are the sky druids, who are more at home soaring through air than standing on the ground. A sky druid has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<p><b>Race: </b>Sylph</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a sky druid who chooses an animal companion must select one with a fly speed. If choosing a domain, the sky druid must choose from the Air, Animals, Liberation, and Weather domains, or subdomains appropriate to those domains.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Sky&#146;s Embrace (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a sky druid no longer takes falling damage, as though she were constantly under the effect of feather fall. Additionally, she may take ranks in the Fly skill regardless of whether she has a natural fly speed, and may use her Fly skill in place of Acrobatics when making jump checks. This ability replaces woodland stride.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Storm (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a sky druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against spells with the air or electricity descriptors and against effects that control or modify the weather (such as sleet storm). This ability replaces resist nature&#146;s lure.</p>
			<p><b>Skymaster (Su): </b>At 5th level, a sky druid can use the fly spell (self only) for a number of minutes per day equal to her druid level. These minutes do not need to be consecutive. This ability replaces trackless step.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 6th level, a sky druid gains the ability to use wild shape. When a sky druid takes the form of a creature with a fly speed, this ability functions at her class level + 1. For all other forms, her effective druid level for the ability is equal to her actual sky druid level. This ability otherwise functions as and replaces wild shape</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as beast shape II . When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as elemental body I .</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as beast shape III . When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as elemental body II . When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as plant shape I .</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as elemental body III . When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as plant shape II .</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as elemental body IV . When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as plant shape III .</p>
			<p><b>Soaring Form (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a sky druid is no longer affected by altitude sickness or natural or magical wind. This ability replaces venom immunity.</p>
			<p><b>Into the Wild Blue (Su): </b>At 13th level, a sky druid gains a fly speed equal to twice her base land speed (good maneuverability). This ability replaces a thousand faces.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A serpent shaman who chooses an animal companion must select a snake. If choosing a domain, the serpent shaman must choose from the Animal, Charm, Trickery, and Water domains.</p>
					<p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
					<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>

					<p>At 6th level, a serpent shaman&#146;s wild shape ability functions at her druid level &#150; 2. If she takes on the form of a snake, she instead uses her druid level + 2.</p>
					<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the beast shape I spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
					<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
					<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as beast shape II . When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as elemental body I.</p>
					<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A shaman with this totem calls upon the cunning serpent, the stealthy deceiver who draws the weak minded in and strikes while they are unaware. Some hate its treacherous nature, while others praise its thoughtful pragmatism.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: A serpent shaman who chooses an animal companion must select a snake. If choosing a domain, the serpent shaman must choose from the Animal, Charm, Trickery, and Water domains.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A serpent shaman can use wild empathy with reptiles as a full-round action with a +4 bonus.</p>
			<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Totem Transformation (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a serpent shaman may adopt an aspect of the snake while retaining her normal form. This ability functions as the bear shaman ability, but the druid may select from the following bonuses: movement (climb speed 20 feet, swim speed 20 feet), scales (+2 natural armor bonus to AC), senses (low-light vision, scent), or natural weapons (bite [1d4], poison [frequency 1 round (6), effect 1 Con damage, Cure 1 save, Con-based DC] for a Medium druid, +2 CMB to grapple). While using totem transformation, the serpent shaman may speak normally and can cast speak with animals (reptiles only) at will.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex) </b>: Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that utilize or target plants, such as <i>blight </i>, <i>entangle </i>, <i>spike growth </i>, and <i>warp wood </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Totemic Summons (Su): </b>At 5th level, a serpent shaman may cast summon nature&#146;s ally as a standard action when summoning snakes, and these summoned creatures gain temporary hit points equal to her druid level. This ability otherwise functions as the bear shaman ability.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 6th level, a serpent shaman&#146;s wild shape ability functions at her druid level &#150; 2. If she takes on the form of a snake, she instead uses her druid level + 2.</p>
			<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat: </b>At 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter, a serpent shaman gains one of the following bonus feats: Combat Expertise, Improved Feint, Skill Focus (Bluff), Stealthy, or Strike Back. She must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats. This ability replaces venom immunity.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Season sages wander as the seasons change, turning the leaves and transforming nature as they pass and taking pleasure in the transition between seasons.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<p><b>Race: </b>Gathlain Only</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex) </b>: Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that utilize or target plants, such as <i>blight </i>, <i>entangle </i>, <i>spike growth </i>, and <i>warp wood </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Season&#146;s Touch (Su): </b>At 4th level, a season sage can infuse living things with the essence of a season with a touch, causing them to manifest the changes associated with that season&#151;for example, a touch of winter can make some animals grow a thick winter coat, while a touch of summer can make them shed. A touch of autumn would make a deciduous tree&#146;s leaves change colors, a touch of winter would make its leaves fall, and a touch of spring would make it put forth new leaves. In addition, a season sage can use the following abilities (in any combination) a total number of times per day equal to 1 + his Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>This replaces wild shape.</p>
			<p><i>Vernal Growth: </i>A touched living creature gains the effects of enlarge person (even if it is not a humanoid) for 1 minute per druid level. A touched non-creature plant likewise doubles in all dimensions for the same duration.</p>
			<p><i>Summer Might: </i>A touched creature gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution for 1 minute per druid level.</p>
			<p><i>Autumn Rot: </i>A touched creature or object made of plant matter takes 1d6 points of acid damage per 2 druid levels.</p>
			<p><i>Winter Frost: </i>A touched creature or object takes 1d6 points of cold damage per 2 druid levels.</p>
			<p><b>Season&#146;s Veil (Su): </b>At 6th level, a season sage can radiate an aura of seasonal power as a standard action once per day. This affects a 20-foot-radius burst centered on the season sage and lasts in that area for 10 minutes, regardless of where the season sage moves afterward. At 8th level and every 2 levels thereafter, the season sage can use this ability an additional time per day. At 10th level, the radius increases to 40 feet.</p>
			<p><i>Vernal Bloom: </i>The area surges with life. Plants form vibrant, heavy undergrowth (see page 426 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook) while in the aura. If the area can support plants, a circle of minor plants lingers afterward. At 8th level, the season sage can affect the area with plant growth as a swift action at will, which can linger after the aura passes.</p>
			<p><i>Summer Heat: </i>The area of effect is treated as if it were under the effects of extreme heat. At 8th level, as a swift action the season sage can have the area deal 1d6 points of fire damage each round to other creatures in the area.</p>
			<p><i>Autumn Squall: </i>The area is filled with fog, rain, and blown leaves. All creatures in the area gain concealment (abilities to specifically see through fog or rain don&#146;t apply).</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the season sage can affect the area with diminish plants as a swift action at will, which also lingers after the aura passes.</p>
			<p><i>Winter Chill: </i>The area of effect is treated as if it were under the effects of extreme cold. At 8th level, as a swift action the season sage can have the area deal 1d6 points of cold damage each round to other creatures in the area.</p>
			<p><b>Venom Immunity (Ex) </b>: At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>
			<p><b>Season Mastery (Sp): </b>At 12th level, a season sage can cast control weather as a spell-like ability once per day; his choice of effects is not limited by the season.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Imbued with the primeval potency of their planet&#146;s seasons, those druids known as season keepers guide Triaxian communities through the stark transition from summer to winter (and vice versa). The nature spirits that season keepers allow to possess their animal companions inspire both awe and dread in onlookers, but all value the gifts of the seasons that the season keepers bestow on their communities.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<p><b>Race: </b>Triaxian Only</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: A season keeper must select an animal companion for her nature bond.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Seasonal Spirits (Su): </b>Starting at 1st level, each day when she prepares spells, a season keeper can imbue her animal companion with the spirit of summer or the spirit of winter.</p>
			<p><i>Spirit of Summer: </i>The season keeper&#146;s animal companion projects a 15-foot-radius aura of cooling and vigor. Allies in the aura can exist comfortably in hot conditions as if they each had the seasoned racial ability of a Summerborn Triaxian. At 3rd level, the aura increases the power of the season keeper&#146;s healing magic&#151;whenever the season keeper targets an ally with a spell that has the healing descriptor, the target also gains fast healing 2 for a number of rounds equal to the spell&#146;s level. At 9th level, allies within the aura leave no trails in natural grassy or forest environments, thus can&#146;t be tracked in such terrain. At 15th level, the duration of the fast healing effect increases to 2 rounds per spell level and affected allies can ignore difficult terrain caused by natural undergrowth such as nonmagical thorns, briars, overgrowth, and similar terrain.</p>
			<p><i>Spirit of Winter: </i>The season keeper&#146;s animal companion projects a 15-foot-radius aura of warmth and calm. This aura allows allies to exist comfortably in cold conditions as if they each had the seasoned racial ability of a Winterborn Triaxian. At 3rd level, allies gain resistance 10 to cold as long as they remain within the aura. At 9th level, affected allies leave no trails in natural snow or ice, thus can&#146;t be tracked in such terrain. At 15th level, affected allies gain resistance 20 to cold and can ignore difficult terrain caused by ice or snow.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex) </b>: Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that utilize or target plants, such as <i>blight </i>, <i>entangle </i>, <i>spike growth </i>, and <i>warp wood </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: A season keeper gains this ability at 6th level, except that her effective druid level for the ability is equal to her druid level &#150; 2. If she has imbued her animal companion with the spirit of winter, she uses her full druid level when taking on the form of an ice elemental. If she has imbued her companion with the spirit of summer, she uses her full druid level when taking on the form of a plant. A season keeper cannot use wild shape to assume the form of an elemental except an ice elemental, and can assume that shape only if her animal companion has the spirit of winter. Similarly, she can assume a plant form only if her animal companion has the spirit of summer. This ability modifies wild shape.</p>
			<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>

					<p>A saurian shaman who chooses an animal companion must select a dinosaur. If choosing a domain, a saurian shaman must choose from the Animal, Destruction, Strength, and War domains.</p>
					<p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
					<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A shaman with this focus calls upon the primeval dinosaur, the archaic terror that lingers as a hungering, atavistic stranger at the fringes of the ecosystem, a destroyer and despoiler whose coming other animals dread.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: A saurian shaman who chooses an animal companion must select a dinosaur. If choosing a domain, a saurian shaman must choose from the Animal, Destruction, Strength, and War domains.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A saurian shaman can use wild empathy with dinosaurs and reptiles as a full-round action with a +4 bonus.</p>
			<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex) </b>: Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that utilize or target plants, such as <i>blight </i>, <i>entangle </i>, <i>spike growth </i>, and <i>warp wood </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 6th level, a saurian shaman&#146;s wild shape ability functions at her druid level &#150;2. If she takes on the form of a reptile or a dinosaur, she instead uses her druid level +2.</p>
			<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat: </b>At 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter, a saurian shaman gains one of the following bonus feats: Improved Overrun, Nimble Moves, Power Attack, Skill Focus (Intimidate), or Vital Strike. She must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats. This ability replaces venom immunity.</p>
			<p><b>Venom Immunity (Ex) </b>: At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Harbingers of decay, rot wardens live in damp lands where insects and rot break down the dead to feed the living. They see in the process of rot the beauty of nature&#146;s capacity to recycle and repurpose material into something wondrous and new.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Invoke Decay (Su): </b>A rot warden can channel stored spell energy into specific spells he hasn&#146;t prepared ahead of time. He can &#147;lose&#148; a prepared spell in order to cast the following spells at the indicated levels: 1st&#151;decompose corpse, 2nd&#151;warp wood, 3rd&#151;fungal infestation, 4th&#151;explosion of rot, 5th&#151;insect plague, 6th&#151;swarm skin, 7th&#151;creeping doom, 8th&#151;horrid wilting, 9th&#151;massacre.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. A rot warden who chooses a cleric domain as his nature bond must choose from the Destruction, Erosion, Repose, or Vermin domains. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Vermin Empathy (Su): </b>A rot warden can improve the attitude of vermin as a normal druid can with animals. Vermin have a starting attitude of unfriendly. The rot warden can also improve the attitude of vermin swarms, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check unless the swarm consists of the same kind of vermin as his vermin companion or his current wild shape.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Swarmcaller (Sp): </b>At 3rd level, a rot warden can summon a swarm of vermin once per day as a standard action. This functions like summon swarm, except the swarm the rot warden summons must be a cockroach, locust, or spider swarm. If he uses this ability during the surprise round of combat, nearby animals and vermin become hushed until the first round of combat ends; during this surprise round and first round of combat, flat-footed creatures also gain the shaken condition (this doesn&#146;t stack with other fear effects). At 9th level, he adds army ant, centipede, and wasp swarms to the list of swarms he can call with this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Enduring Druid (Su): </b>At 4th level, a rot warden gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against attacks and special abilities of vermin and swarms with the vermin type. This bonus also applies on saving throws against effects that would age or decay the rot warden or his equipment.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: A rot warden gains this ability at 6th level, except his effective druid level is his druid level &#150; 2. He cannot take the form of an elemental.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a rot warden can assume the form of a Small or Medium vermin as if using vermin shape I. At 10th level, the rot warden can assume the shape of a Tiny or Large vermin as if using vermin shape II. At 12th level, he can take the form of a Huge vermin as if using vermin shape III.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Venom Immunity (Ex) </b>: At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, a road keeper can discourage creatures from entering or exiting the wild. Once per day as a standard action, she can target a creature within 30 feet and curse it with clumsiness and disorientation. The road keeper chooses whether to punish her target for entering the wild from a road or building, or vice versa. If her target is entering the wild, it treats every square of wilderness not on a road or in a building as difficult terrain. If her target is exiting the wild, it treats every square on a road or inside a building as difficult terrain. In either case, the ground feels uneven and the target suffers extreme vertigo during movement. The victim of this curse can attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half the road keeper&#146;s level + her Wisdom modifier) at the beginning of its turn each round to end the effect. The effect lasts until the target successfully saves or for a number of minutes equal to the road keeper&#146;s level. A creature&#146;s movement isn&#146;t affected if it is burrowing, climbing, earth gliding, flying, or swimming. This is a mind-affecting curse effect.</p>
					<p>At 6th level and every 2 levels thereafter, the road keeper can target an additional creature per day with this ability (to a maximum number of nine targets per day at 20th level). She can target more than one creature with a single use of this ability or the same target more than once in the same day (though its effects do not stack), but her total number of targets per day cannot exceed this daily maximum. If she targets more than one creature at one time, each target must be within 30 feet of the road keeper.</p>

The effect lasts until the target successfully saves or for a number of minutes equal to the road keeper&#146;s level.

If she targets more than one creature at one time, each target must be within 30 feet of the road keeper.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Guardians of the lonely paths between cities, road keepers protect the wild from travelers, and travelers from the wild.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>One with the Road (Su): </b>A road keeper casts the following spells as though her caster level were 1 higher: 1st&#151;longstrider, 2nd&#151;scent trail, 3rd&#151;nature&#146;s exile, 4th&#151;freedom of movement, 5th&#151;tree stride, 6th&#151;find the path, 7th&#151;wind walk, 8th&#151;word of recall, 9th&#151;world wave. At 9th level, the bonus to her caster level for these spells increases to +2.</p>
			<p><b>Road Bond (Ex): </b>If the road keeper chooses a cleric domain as her nature bond, she must choose from the Community, Liberation, Protection, Travel, or Weather domains. The road keeper can also choose any subdomain associated with these domains.</p>
			<p><b>Take the High Road (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a road keeper travels over roads and paths at an accelerated rate. She and her allies can hustle for 2 hours without taking nonlethal damage, instead of 1, provided they travel along a road or path. Additionally, as long as they travel on a road or path, the road keeper and her allies count as traveling along a highway regardless of the quality of the road or path on which they travel. Allies must remain within 30 feet of the road keeper to benefit from this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Road Less Traveled (Su): </b>At 4th level, a road keeper can discourage creatures from entering or exiting the wild. Once per day as a standard action, she can target a creature within 30 feet and curse it with clumsiness and disorientation. The road keeper chooses whether to punish her target for entering the wild from a road or building, or vice versa. If her target is entering the wild, it treats every square of wilderness not on a road or in a building as difficult terrain. If her target is exiting the wild, it treats every square on a road or inside a building as difficult terrain. In either case, the ground feels uneven and the target suffers extreme vertigo during movement. The victim of this curse can attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half the road keeper&#146;s level + her Wisdom modifier) at the beginning of its turn each round to end the effect. The effect lasts until the target successfully saves or for a number of minutes equal to the road keeper&#146;s level. A creature&#146;s movement isn&#146;t affected if it is burrowing, climbing, earth gliding, flying, or swimming. This is a mind-affecting curse effect.</p>
			<p>At 6th level and every 2 levels thereafter, the road keeper can target an additional creature per day with this ability (to a maximum number of nine targets per day at 20th level). She can target more than one creature with a single use of this ability or the same target more than once in the same day (though its effects do not stack), but her total number of targets per day cannot exceed this daily maximum. If she targets more than one creature at one time, each target must be within 30 feet of the road keeper.</p>
			<p><b>Trodden Path (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a road keeper gains a +4 bonus on Survival checks to follow or identify tracks. She also gains this bonus on saving throws against severe weather effects.</p>
			<p><b>Venom Immunity (Ex) </b>: At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level, a river druid takes no penalty to speed or on Acrobatics or Stealth checks in shallow water up to 2 feet deep (1 foot deep for Small characters) such as shallow bogs, shorelines, streams, and partially flooded areas. A river druid (and any vehicle she pilots) isn&#146;t moved by flowing water unless she allows it. Water that has been magically manipulated to impede or boost motion still affects her.</p>

					<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>These druids are the guardians of rivers and the creatures that depend on them. Just as rivers pour from mountains to seas, river druids adapt to many environments and cultures. They can be found wherever water flows, even among underground rivers or sewer systems.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Ferrier (Ex): </b>A river druid adds Diplomacy to her list of class skills and gains a +2 bonus on Diplomacy and Knowledge (nature) skill checks.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Read the Currents (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a river druid gains a bonus equal to half her druid level on initiative checks and Acrobatics, Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, Survival, and Swim checks when she is in, on, or adjacent to flowing water.</p>
			<p><b>Countercurrent (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a river druid takes no penalty to speed or on Acrobatics or Stealth checks in shallow water up to 2 feet deep (1 foot deep for Small characters) such as shallow bogs, shorelines, streams, and partially flooded areas. A river druid (and any vehicle she pilots) isn&#146;t moved by flowing water unless she allows it. Water that has been magically manipulated to impede or boost motion still affects her.</p>
			<p><b>Deep Breath (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a river druid can hold her breath for a number of minutes equal to her Constitution score (after this, she must begin attempting Constitution checks to avoid suffocation as normal).</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: A river druid gains this ability at 6th level, except her effective druid level for the ability is equal to her druid level &#150; 2.</p>
			<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Venom Immunity (Ex) </b>: At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Tongue of the Sun and Moon (Ex): </b>At 15th level, a river druid can speak with any living creature.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Restorers carefully tend to the health of both the environment and creatures in it. Restorers in the most remote places often choose druidic herbalism as their nature bond option.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Healing Touch (Ex): </b>A restorer gains a +2 bonus on Heal checks. When a restorer uses Heal to provide first aid, the bonus increases to +3.</p>
			<p><b>Natural Medic: </b>A restorer can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that she did not prepare ahead of time. The restorer can &#147;lose&#148; any prepared spell in order to cast any cure spell she can cast of the same spell level or lower (a cure spell is any spell with &#147;cure&#148; in its name).</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Enemy of Blight (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a restorer can ignore the effects of an overgrown area that has been magically manipulated to impede motion. She can ignore these effects for a number of rounds per day equal to double her Wisdom bonus. These rounds don&#146;t have to be used consecutively.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Venom Immunity (Ex) </b>: At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>
			<p><b>Guide across Lifetimes (Sp): </b>At 13th level, once per day as a full-round action, a restorer can cast reincarnate without a material component.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
					<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
					<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as beast shape II . When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as elemental body I.</p>
					<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as beast shape III . When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as elemental body II. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as plant shape I .</p>
					<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as elemental body III . When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as plant shape II .</p>
					<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as elemental body IV . When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as plant shape III .</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Spun off into the endless circle of life, an incarnate druid is an embodiment of nature&#146;s eternal renewal. She lives many lives and wanders the world devoid of attachments, a stranger to all yet one with all life.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Mysterious Stranger (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a reincarnated druids adds 1/2 her druid level to the DC of Sense Motive, Diplomacy, and Knowledge checks to learn about her. This ability replaces woodland stride.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Death&#146;s Touch (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a reincarnated druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against death effects, energy drain, and necromancy effects, and on stabilization checks when dying. This ability replaces resist nature&#146;s lure.</p>
			<p><b>Many Lives (Ex): </b>At 5th level, if a reincarnated druid is killed, she may automatically reincarnate (as the spell) 1 day later. The reincarnated druid appears in a safe location within 1 mile of her previous body. At will for the next 7 days, she can sense the presence of her remains as if using locate object as a spell-like ability. If she is killed during these 7 days, she remains dead and does not reincarnate. The many lives ability does not function ifthe reincarnated druid is slain by a death effect. A reincarnated druid cannot be raised from the dead or resurrected, though she can be reincarnated.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: A reincarnated druid gains this ability at 6th level, and it functions at her druid level &#150; 2.</p>
			<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Cheat Death (Ex): </b>At 9th level, once per day, a reincarnated druid may reroll a save against a death effect, energy drain, or necromancy effect before the result of the roll is revealed, or reroll a failed stabilization check while dying. She must take the result of the second roll, even if it is worse than the original roll. This ability replaces venom immunity.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Tongue of the Sun and Moon (Ex): </b>At 15th level, a reincarnated druid can speak with any living creature. This ability replaces timeless body.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A progenitor infuses herself with fey magic so that she is treated as either her original creature type or the fey type for the purposes of spells or effects that target a creature by type, whichever is more beneficial to her. Additionally, the progenitor chooses one of two forms through which this bond expresses itself: magic or nature.</p>
					<p>A progenitor who chooses magic as her primal bond can draw upon wild magic as a swift action to attempt to cast a prepared spell without losing that spell from its spell slot. To use this ability, she casts the spell as she would normally, but as the spell&#146;s effects take place, she must attempt a concentration check (DC = 20 + twice the spell&#146;s level). If she fails, she expends the spell normally as if she had cast it, but its effects are replaced by a wild magic effect (see page 63) with a CR equal to her caster level and she is staggered until the end of her next turn. If she succeeds, she casts the spell normally and it is not expended from her prepared spell slot, allowing her to cast that spell again at a later point. A progenitor can use wild magic in this manner once per day plus one additional time per day at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter.</p>
					<p>A progenitor who chooses nature as her primal bond can create plants as a full-round action. She can do so once per day plus one additional time per day per 5 levels. At the start of her next turn, so long as she is touching a solid surface underfoot, a 5-foot radius of mobile undergrowth springs to life around the progenitor for a number of rounds equal to 3 plus the progenitor&#146;s Wisdom bonus. Upon activating this ability, the progenitor chooses whether the undergrowth provides cover or difficult terrain. If the progenitor chooses cover, her undergrowth provides a cover bonus to AC to the progenitor and allies within the radius. If she chooses difficult terrain, enemies who enter the radius of undergrowth treat it as difficult terrain. A progenitor&#146;s undergrowth is treated as forest terrain if it provides cover and plains terrain if it provides difficult terrain. This radius increases by 5 feet at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some druids forge powerful bonds with the raw, natural power of the First World. Progenitors are druids who tap into the vibrant power of the First World to propagate natural and supernatural wonders.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Infused Summoning (Ex): </b>When a progenitor casts summon nature&#146;s ally to summon a creature, the summoned creature gains fast healing equal to the progenitor&#146;s level (maximum equal to the progenitor&#146;s Wisdom modifier).</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Primal Bond (Ex): </b>A progenitor infuses herself with fey magic so that she is treated as either her original creature type or the fey type for the purposes of spells or effects that target a creature by type, whichever is more beneficial to her. Additionally, the progenitor chooses one of two forms through which this bond expresses itself: magic or nature.</p>
			<p>A progenitor who chooses magic as her primal bond can draw upon wild magic as a swift action to attempt to cast a prepared spell without losing that spell from its spell slot. To use this ability, she casts the spell as she would normally, but as the spell&#146;s effects take place, she must attempt a concentration check (DC = 20 + twice the spell&#146;s level). If she fails, she expends the spell normally as if she had cast it, but its effects are replaced by a wild magic effect (see page 63) with a CR equal to her caster level and she is staggered until the end of her next turn. If she succeeds, she casts the spell normally and it is not expended from her prepared spell slot, allowing her to cast that spell again at a later point. A progenitor can use wild magic in this manner once per day plus one additional time per day at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter.</p>
			<p>A progenitor who chooses nature as her primal bond can create plants as a full-round action. She can do so once per day plus one additional time per day per 5 levels. At the start of her next turn, so long as she is touching a solid surface underfoot, a 5-foot radius of mobile undergrowth springs to life around the progenitor for a number of rounds equal to 3 plus the progenitor&#146;s Wisdom bonus. Upon activating this ability, the progenitor chooses whether the undergrowth provides cover or difficult terrain. If the progenitor chooses cover, her undergrowth provides a cover bonus to AC to the progenitor and allies within the radius. If she chooses difficult terrain, enemies who enter the radius of undergrowth treat it as difficult terrain. A progenitor&#146;s undergrowth is treated as forest terrain if it provides cover and plains terrain if it provides difficult terrain. This radius increases by 5 feet at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Fey Shape (Su): </b>A progenitor never gains the ability to use wild shape to transform into an elemental.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a progenitor can use wild shape to change into a Small or Medium fey. When doing so, her wild shape functions as fey form I.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a progenitor can use wild shape to change into a Tiny or Large fey. When she does so, her wild shape functions as fey form II.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a progenitor can use wild shape to change into a Diminutive or Huge fey. When she does so, her wild shape functions as fey form III.</p>
			<p>At 14th level, when a progenitor uses wild shape to assume a fey form, her wild shape functions as fey form IV.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex) </b>: Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that utilize or target plants, such as <i>blight </i>, <i>entangle </i>, <i>spike growth </i>, and <i>warp wood </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Venom Immunity (Ex) </b>: At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A planar extremist forms a bond with a manifestation of the Outer Plane with which she is aligned. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the plane to which she is aligned, granting the planar extremist one of the domains of her alignment (for example, a lawful good planar extremist could take either the Lawful or Good domain). This option otherwise functions as a druid&#146;s nature bond if she chose a close tie to the natural world.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an outsider from an Outer Plane. The abilities of this outsider companion are determined using the rules for eidolons for the unchained summonerPU class, as if the planar extremist were a summoner of her druid level, except the outsider companion gains no additional evolution pool (only the evolutions from its base form and base evolutions for its subtype), and it must be of a subtype whose alignment exactly matches the alignment of the planar extremist. The planar extremist can summon her outsider companion with the same 1-minute ritual a summoner normally uses to do so, but she can&#146;t cast summon monster spells if she currently has her outsider companion summoned, and she can&#146;t summon her companion if she already has a creature summoned through other means.</p>
					<p>As the planar ally gains class levels, her eidolon&#146;s base statistics and base evolutions increase as if her druid level were her summoner level. The eidolon gains the darkvision, link, share spells, evasion, ability score increase, devotion, multiattack, and improved evasion abilities at the appropriate levels, but never gains an evolution pool. Abilities and spells that grant additional evolution points to eidolons do not function for her outsider companion, though any abilities that would grant evolution points to an animal companion do work. The planar extremist does not gain life link or any other class features a summoner gains in relation to her eidolon.</p>

The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Through determined interest or repeated exposure to those places where the borders between planes are weaker, some druids lose their neutral stance and find themselves gravitating toward one of the four most extreme alignments: chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful evil, or lawful good. While no longer able to harness the forces of nature like their neutral kin, these planar extremists find that their powers have shifted to reflect the Outer Plane most closely associated with their alignment. This is an ex-class archetype and can be taken by a character immediately upon becoming an ex-druid.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>
			<h>Ex-Class Archetype</h>
			<p>The following archetype can be taken by an ex-druid immediately upon becoming an ex-druid, regardless of character level, replacing some or all of the lost class abilities. If another archetype the character had before she became an ex-druid replaces the same ability as the ex-class archetype, she loses the old archetype in favor of the new one; otherwise, she can retain both archetypes as normal. Planar extremixts can gain further levels in the druid class, even though becoming an ex-druid normally prohibits further advancement in the class. While an ex-member of a class can recant her failings and atone for her fall from her original class (typically involving an atonement spell), her acceptance of her ex-class archetype means she must atone both for her initial fall and for further straying from the path. As a result, such a character must be the target of two atonement spells or a similar effect to regain her lost class features. Upon doing so, she immediately loses this archetype and regains her original class (and archetype, if she had one).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Aura (Ex): </b>The planar extremist radiates an aura matching her alignment as if she were a cleric of her druid level.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A planar extremist gains one fewer spell slot per spell level than normal in which to prepare spells. The planar extremist removes all summon nature&#146;s ally spells from her spell list and replaces them with the summon monster spells of the same levels. The druid can otherwise cast spells as normal for a druid of her level.</p>
			<p>A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A planar extremist can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn&#146;t prepared ahead of time. She can lose a prepared spell in order to cast a summon monster spell of the same level or lower, but only to summon creatures whose alignment matches hers.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Planar Bond: </b>A planar extremist forms a bond with a manifestation of the Outer Plane with which she is aligned. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the plane to which she is aligned, granting the planar extremist one of the domains of her alignment (for example, a lawful good planar extremist could take either the Lawful or Good domain). This option otherwise functions as a druid&#146;s nature bond if she chose a close tie to the natural world.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an outsider from an Outer Plane. The abilities of this outsider companion are determined using the rules for eidolons for the unchained summonerPU class, as if the planar extremist were a summoner of her druid level, except the outsider companion gains no additional evolution pool (only the evolutions from its base form and base evolutions for its subtype), and it must be of a subtype whose alignment exactly matches the alignment of the planar extremist. The planar extremist can summon her outsider companion with the same 1-minute ritual a summoner normally uses to do so, but she can&#146;t cast summon monster spells if she currently has her outsider companion summoned, and she can&#146;t summon her companion if she already has a creature summoned through other means.</p>
			<p>As the planar ally gains class levels, her eidolon&#146;s base statistics and base evolutions increase as if her druid level were her summoner level. The eidolon gains the darkvision, link, share spells, evasion, ability score increase, devotion, multiattack, and improved evasion abilities at the appropriate levels, but never gains an evolution pool. Abilities and spells that grant additional evolution points to eidolons do not function for her outsider companion, though any abilities that would grant evolution points to an animal companion do work. The planar extremist does not gain life link or any other class features a summoner gains in relation to her eidolon.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Resist the Opposite (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a planar extremist gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of creatures whose alignment is diametrically opposed to her own.</p>
			<p><b>Planar Aspect (Su): </b>At 4th level, as a standard action, a planar extremist can gain the benefits of the bloodrager bloodline associated with her alignment (choosing from Abyssal, Celestial, or Infernal), as if she were a bloodrager of her druid level. She can gain these benefits for 1 minute per druid level as if she were bloodraging (but she gains no other benefits or penalties of bloodrage) or until she dismisses it as a swift action; this duration need not be used consecutively but must be spent in 1-minute increments. She can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every 4 levels thereafter, for a total of five times per day at 18th level. At 20th level, a planar extremist can use planar aspect at will.</p>
			<p><b>Venom Immunity (Ex) </b>: At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

				<name type="string">Nature bond</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
					<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>

					<p>A plains druid gains this ability at 6th level, except that her effective druid level for the ability is equal to her druid level &#150; 2.</p>
					<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the beast shape I spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
					<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
					<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as beast shape II . When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as elemental body I.</p>
					<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature.

					<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as beast shape II . When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as elemental body I.</p>
					<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as beast shape III . When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as elemental body II. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as plant shape I .</p>
					<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as elemental body III . When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as plant shape II .</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Out upon the wide and rolling prairies and savannahs, plains druids stand guard over the grasslands. These druids range far and wide, watching over nomadic tribes and wandering herds and preserving the sometimes fragile ecosystem of the wide open spaces.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Plains Traveler (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a plains druid gains a bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks equal to 1/2 her druid level in plains terrain, and she cannot be tracked in such an environment. This ability replaces woodland stride.</p>
			<p><b>Run Like the Wind (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a plains druid gains +10 feet to her land speed when wearing light or no armor and carrying a light load, and once per hour, she may run or charge at double the normal speed for 1 round. If riding her animal companion, it gains this ability instead. This ability replaces trackless step.</p>
			<p><b>Savanna Ambush (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a plains druid gains concealment whenever she is prone in natural surroundings, and can make Stealth checks at no penalty when prone and not moving or at &#150;5 when crawling. A plains druid can stand up from prone as an immediate action during a surprise round. This ability replaces resist nature&#146;s lure.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: A plains druid gains this ability at 6th level, except that her effective druid level for the ability is equal to her druid level &#150; 2.</p>
			<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Canny Charger (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a plains druid can charge through allies&#146; squares without difficulty (whether mounted or afoot) and can turn up to 90 degrees once during a charge, provided the last 10 feet toward the target are in a straight line. She also gains a +4 dodge bonus to AC against enemy charge attacks and a +4 bonus to damage with a readied action against a charging foe. This ability replaces venom immunity.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a plains druid gains evasion when wearing light or no armor and carrying a light load. This functions as the rogue ability of the same name. This ability replaces a thousand faces.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some druids bond with many animal companions rather than just one, achieving a level of communion rare even in druidic circles and leading their pack brothers and pack sisters with total authority.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Pack Bond (Ex): </b>A pack lord druid may not select a domain and must choose an animal companion. The druid gains a +2 bonus on wild empathy and Handle Animal checks made regarding her animal companion. The pack lord may have more than one animal companion, but she must divide up her effective druid level between her companions to determine the abilities of each companion. For example, a 4th-level pack lord can have one 4th-level companion, two 2nd-level companions, or one 1st-level and one 3rd-level companion.</p>
			<p>Each time a pack lord&#146;s druid level increases, she must decide how to allocate the increase among her animal companions (including the option of adding a new 1st-level companion). Once a druid level is allocated to a particular companion, it cannot be redistributed while that companion is in the pack lord&#146;s service (she must release the companion or wait until the companion dies to allocate its levels to another companion, which she can do the next time she prepares spells). The share spells animal companion ability only applies to one animal companion at a time&#151;the pack lord cannot use it to cast a one-target spell and have it affect all of her animal companions. This ability replaces nature bond.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex) </b>: Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that utilize or target plants, such as <i>blight </i>, <i>entangle </i>, <i>spike growth </i>, and <i>warp wood </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Empathic Link (Su): </b>The pack lord gains an empathic link with all of her animal companions. This functions like an empathic link with a familiar. In addition, as a swift action the pack lord can shift her perception to one of her companions, allowing her to experience what it sees, hears, and so on. She can maintain this connection as long as she likes (as long as the companion is within 1 mile) and end it as a free action. The druid can only use this ability on one companion at a time, and cannot see, hear, or smell with her own body while maintaining this connection. This ability replaces the 6th-level additional use of wild shape.</p>
			<p><b>Venom Immunity (Ex) </b>: At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

					<p>A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>

					<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Nithveil adepts learn the secret magic of the First World fey in the moving, reality-phasing city of Nithveil, which appears on the new moon at seemingly random locations in the Grungir Forest in the Lands of the Linnorm Kings. The most common deities worshiped by these druids are the Green Mother and the Lantern King, Eldest patrons of intrigue and trickery.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Animal Speech (Su): </b>A Nithveil adept can imbue normal animals with the ability to speak for a brief period. Once per day as a standard action, the Nithveil adept can touch an animal to grant it the ability to speak any language the druid knows for 1 minute per druid level. This does not increase the animal&#146;s Intelligence or improve its attitude, and the animal behaves as though communicating with someone under the effects of a speak with animals spell, save that it can speak with anyone who understands the language the Nithveil adept grants it. The Nithveil adept gains one additional use of this ability at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: A Nithveil adept cannot select an animal companion, and can take only a domain. If she worships an Eldest, the Nithveil trickster can choose any of the domains or subdomains granted by that Eldest in addition to those normally available to druids.</p>
			<p><b>Nithveil Skills: </b>A Nithveil adept adds Bluff, Diplomacy, Disguise, Sense Motive, Perform (any), and Stealth to her list of class skills.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Fey Influence (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a Nithveil adept gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey. Once per day before attempting such a saving throw, the Nithveil adept can choose to roll two dice and take the better result, applying the +4 bonus as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Locate Nithveil (Sp): </b>At 9th level, a Nithveil adept can cast find the path as a spell-like ability, but only to locate Nithveil. The spell&#146;s duration is extended until the druid reaches her destination or until Nithveil recedes from the Material Plane at the end of the new moon. This ability can be used only once per month, during the new moon.</p>
			<p><b>Venom Immunity (Ex) </b>: At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

				<level type="number">1</level>
				<name type="string">Nature bond</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
					<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>

					<p>A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>

					<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Nature priests serve two masters: their deities and nature itself, and can call upon the power of both to fuel their divine abilities.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A nature priest is proficient with her deity&#146;s favored weapon in addition to a druid&#146;s typical weapon proficiencies.</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Chosen Druid (Ex): </b>If a nature priest chooses a domain for her nature bond, she must choose one of her deity&#146;s domains (or subdomains) in place of those typically available to a druid.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Studious Piety (Ex): </b>A nature priest gains a +1 bonus on Knowledge (religion) checks. This bonus increases to +2 when attempting checks that involve knowledge of her deity or her faith.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Shepherd of the Faithful (Su): </b>At 4th level, a nature priest and all allies within 60 feet that can see or hear her gain a +2 insight bonus on skill checks to notice or avoid natural hazards, difficult terrain, and rough winds or water, as well as on saving throws against natural hazards. This ability offers no protection against the abilities of creatures or the effects of spells or items.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Divine Servants (Su): </b>At 9th level, a nature priest adds the spells lesser planar ally, planar ally, and greater planar ally to her druid spell list at their cleric spell levels. When she casts these spells, the planar allies summoned require half the payment described in those spells.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the beast shape I spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
					<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
					<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as beast shape II . When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as elemental body I.</p>
					<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as beast shape III . When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as elemental body II. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as plant shape I .</p>
					<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as elemental body III . When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as plant shape II .</p>
					<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as elemental body IV . When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as plant shape III .</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A nature fang is a druid who stalks and slays those who despoil nature, kill scarce animals, or introduce diseases to unprotected habitats. She gives up a close empathic connection with the natural world to become its deadly champion and avenger.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Target (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a nature fang gains the slayer&#146;s studied target class feature. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, the nature fang&#146;s bonus against her studied target increases by 1. Unlike a slayer, a nature fang does not gain the ability to maintain more than one studied target at the same time. This ability replaces nature sense, wild empathy, and woodland stride.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer Talent: </b>At 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a nature fang selects a slayer talent. Starting at 12th level, she can select an advanced slayer talent in place of a slayer talent. She uses her druid level as her slayer level to determine what talents she can select. This ability replaces wild shape.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer Talents: </b>The following slayer talents complement the nature fang archetype: foil scrutiny, poison use, ranger combat style. Additionally, the following rogue talents, which are also available to slayers, complement the archetype: bleeding attack, camouflage, fast stealth, finesse rogue, lasting poison, rogue crawl, slow reactions, surprise attack, swift poison, terrain mastery.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>The following advanced talents complement the nature fang archetype: assassinate, slayer camouflage, woodland stride. The rogue advanced talent master of disguiseAPG also fits the archetype.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a nature fang gains sneak attack +1d6. This functions as the rogue sneak attack ability. If the nature fang gets a sneak attack bonus from another source, the bonuses on damage stack. This ability replaces resist nature&#146;s lure.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Studied Target: </b>At 9th level, a nature fang can study an opponent as a move or swift action. This ability replaces venom immunity.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

					<p>At 9th level and every four levels thereafter, a naga aspirant can choose one of the following abilities to enhance her naga form. Once chosen, this augmentation cannot be changed and always applies to her naga form. The caster level for these abilities is equal to her druid level, and unless otherwise stated, the DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the druid&#146;s class level + the druid&#146;s Charisma bonus. This ability replaces venom immunity, a thousand faces, and timeless body.</p>
					<p><i>Charming Gaze (Sp): </i>The druid gains a gaze attack that affects creatures within 30 feet as a charm person spell.</p>
					<p><i>Darkvision (Su): </i>The druid gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet.</p>
					<p><i>Detect Thoughts (Su): </i>The druid can use detect thoughts at will.</p>
					<p><i>Guarded Thoughts (Ex): </i>The druid gains a +2 racial bonus on saves against charm effects and immunity to any form of mind reading (such as detect thoughts).</p>
					<p><i>Poison Immunity (Ex): </i>The druid gains immunity to all poisons. The druid&#146;s naga form must have at least one poison-based natural attack in order to select this ability.</p>
					<p><i>Poisonous Sting (Ex): </i>The druid&#146;s stinger becomes venomous. The naga form must have a tail stinger to take this ability. Sting&#151;injury; save Fort DC 10 + 1/2 the druid&#146;s class level + the druid&#146;s Constitution modifier; frequency 1 round; effect sleep for 2d4 minutes; cure 1 save.</p>
					<p><i>Spit Venom (Ex): </i>The naga form can spit her venom up to 30 feet as a standard action. This is a ranged touch attack with no range increment.

					<p>Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>

				<name type="string">Nature bond</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
					<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>

Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>

					<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The naga aspirant follows the ancient beliefs and engages in the rituals of a druidic sect dedicated to the transcendence of her nagaji form through absolute devotion to nagas and naga gods. Through acting as a herald to the naga deities, the aspirant is rewarded with the ability to unlock her ultimate spirit form and become a true naga. A naga aspirant has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<p><b>Race: </b>Nagaji Only</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Aspirant&#146;s Bond (Ex): </b>A naga aspirant gains a spiritual connection to the serpentine deities worshiped by the nagas. At 1st level, and each time she gains a druid level, she may add one of the following spells to her druid spell list.</p>
			<p>0&#151;acid splash, bleed, daze, mage hand, open/close, ray of frost; 1st&#151;charm person, divine favor, expeditious retreat, mage armor, magic missile, ray of enfeeblement, shield, shield of faith, silent image, true strike; 2nd&#151;acid arrow, detect thoughts, invisibility, mirror image, scorching ray, see invisibility; 3rd&#151;dispel magic, displacement, fireball, lightning bolt, suggestion; 4th&#151;divine power, greater invisibility.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Aspirant&#146;s Enlightenment (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a naga aspirant gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like abilities, supernatural abilities, and poison of nagas. This ability replaces resist nature&#146;s lure.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Naga Shape (Su): </b>At 6th level, the naga aspirant can use her wild shape ability (gained at 4th level, as normal) to assume the form of a true naga. This effect functions in a similar manner to a shapechange spell with the following exception. The druid&#146;s true naga form is unique, representing her personal evolution. When taking naga form, the nagaji&#146;s body transforms into that of a large serpent, though she keeps her own head. The naga aspirant loses her limbs and her size increases by one category, granting her a +4 size bonus to Strength and Constitution, a &#150;2 penalty to Dexterity, and a +2 enhancement bonus to her natural armor bonus. She gains a +10 enhancement bonus to land speed and a bite attack that deals 1d6 points of damage. She can cast verbal spells in this form, but cannot cast spells with other components without metamagic or feats such as Natural Spell. This otherwise works like and replaces wild shape.</p>
			<p><b>Augmented Form (Su): </b>At 9th level and every four levels thereafter, a naga aspirant can choose one of the following abilities to enhance her naga form. Once chosen, this augmentation cannot be changed and always applies to her naga form. The caster level for these abilities is equal to her druid level, and unless otherwise stated, the DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the druid&#146;s class level + the druid&#146;s Charisma bonus. This ability replaces venom immunity, a thousand faces, and timeless body.</p>
			<p><i>Charming Gaze (Sp): </i>The druid gains a gaze attack that affects creatures within 30 feet as a charm person spell.</p>
			<p><i>Darkvision (Su): </i>The druid gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet.</p>
			<p><i>Detect Thoughts (Su): </i>The druid can use detect thoughts at will.</p>
			<p><i>Guarded Thoughts (Ex): </i>The druid gains a +2 racial bonus on saves against charm effects and immunity to any form of mind reading (such as detect thoughts).</p>
			<p><i>Poison Immunity (Ex): </i>The druid gains immunity to all poisons. The druid&#146;s naga form must have at least one poison-based natural attack in order to select this ability.</p>
			<p><i>Poisonous Sting (Ex): </i>The druid&#146;s stinger becomes venomous. The naga form must have a tail stinger to take this ability.

Her wild shape form becomes her natural form, though she can transform into her original nagaji shape at will. Her creature type permanently changes to aberration. This ability replaces wildshape (at will).</p>

				<name type="string">Nature bond</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
					<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>

Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>

Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>As more and more of the soft, easy lands become cultivated and civilized, many druids look for refuge and solitude among the eternal peaks of the highest mountains.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Mountaineer (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a mountain druid gains a bonus on Initiative checks and Climb, Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks equal to half her druid level in mountainous terrain, and she cannot be tracked in such an environment. This ability replaces woodland stride.</p>
			<p><b>Sure-Footed (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a mountain druid suffers no penalty to speed or on Acrobatics or Stealth checks when walking across steep slopes, rubble, or scree. This ability replaces trackless step.</p>
			<p><b>Spire Walker (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a mountain druid does not lose her Dexterity bonus when climbing. A mountain druid is immune to altitude sickness and ignores the effects of a cold climate as if under the effects of endure elements. This ability replaces resist nature&#146;s lure.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: A mountain druid gains this ability at 6th level, except that her effective druid level for the ability is equal to her druid level &#150; 2. A mountain druid cannot use wild shape to adopt a plant form. However, at 12th level she can assume the form of a Large giant as if using giant form I. At 16th level, she may assume the form of a Huge giant as if using giant form II.</p>
			<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Mountain Stance (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a mountain druid gains immunity to petrification and receives a +4 bonus on saving throws or to CMD to resist any attempt to push, pull, bull rush, or drag her, or to resist any other effect that would physically move her from her position (e.g., repel wood, reverse gravity, or being blown away by high winds). This does not protect her against being tripped, grappled, or overrun. This ability replaces venom immunity.</p>
			<p><b>Mountain Stone (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a mountain druid can transform her body into a weathered stone outcrop and back at will. This effect functions as statue. This ability replaces a thousand faces.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

				<name type="string">Nature bond</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
					<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>

					<p>A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>

					<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the beast shape I spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A mooncaller is bound to the subtle influences of the ever-changing moon and its endless cycles from light to dark and back again.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Night Sight (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a mooncaller gains low-light vision. If she already has low-light vision, she gains darkvision with a range of 30 feet. If she already has darkvision, the range of her darkvision is increased by 30 feet. This ability replaces woodland stride.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Call of the Wild (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a mooncaller gains a +4 bonus on saving throws to avoid confusion, daze, feeblemind, and insanity effects. She also gains a +4 bonus against the exceptional, spell-like, and supernatural abilities of creatures with the shapechanger subtype. This ability replaces resist nature&#146;s lure.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Purity of Body (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a mooncaller gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases. This ability replaces venom immunity.</p>
			<p><b>Wolfsbane (Su): </b>At 13th level, a mooncaller gains DR 3/silver, increasing to DR 4/silver at 16th level and DR 5/silver at 19th level. This ability replaces a thousand faces.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

This ability replaces woodland stride and trackless step.</p>

					<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some druids study the paths of nature&#146;s power through the nodes and ley lines that connect standing stones and megalithic circles, learning to tap into their energies.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Sense (Sp): </b>At 1st level, a menhir savant can detect the presence of undead; fey; outsiders; and astral, ethereal, or incorporeal creatures. This ability functions like detect undead, and the druid detects all of these creatures rather than trying to detect one kind. This ability replaces nature sense and wild empathy.</p>
			<p><b>Place Magic (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a menhir savant learns to identify and tap into ley lines in different types of terrain. As a free action, she can tap into the magic of a nearby ley line and increase her caster level by +1 for 1 round. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Wisdom bonus. This ability replaces woodland stride and trackless step.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex) </b>: Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that utilize or target plants, such as <i>blight </i>, <i>entangle </i>, <i>spike growth </i>, and <i>warp wood </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Walk the Lines (Su): </b>At 9th level, a menhir savant can use her connection to ley lines to cast transport via plants a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom bonus.</p>
			<p><b>Empty Body (Su): </b>At 13th level, a menhir savant can become ethereal as a standard action, as if using ethereal jaunt. She can remain ethereal for a number of rounds per day equal to her druid level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. This ability replaces a thousand faces.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

					<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

This ability functions like the beast shape I spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
					<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
					<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as beast shape II . When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as elemental body I.</p>
					<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A mantella focuses on exploring her poisonous heritage, whether or not it has manifested in her own personal biology. The mantella is an archetype available to grippli druids.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex) </b>: Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that utilize or target plants, such as <i>blight </i>, <i>entangle </i>, <i>spike growth </i>, and <i>warp wood </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Affinity (Su): </b>At 4th level, if a form the mantella assumes with wild shape has any poison abilities, the mantella also gains those abilities. However, the mantilla can never use wild shape to take the form of an elemental.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Toxic Diet (Ex): </b>At 6th level, both the mantella and her animal companion gain immunity to poison. Additionally, as an immediate action when exposed to a dose of poison, a mantella can absorb the toxin and store it internally for up to 1 day. As a swift action, a mantella can secrete this poison; this changes the poison&#146;s type to injury and applies the dose of poison to all of the druid&#146;s natural attacks. A mantella can use this ability three times per day, plus one additional time per day at 8th level and every 2 druid levels thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

This ability functions like the beast shape I spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A shaman with this totem calls upon the proud lion, imposing and majestic, the mighty leader of deadly hunters.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: A lion shaman who chooses an animal companion must select a lion. If choosing a domain, the lion shaman must choose from the Animal, Glory, Nobility, and Sun domains.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A lion shaman can use wild empathy with felines as a full-round action with a +4 bonus.</p>
			<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Totem Transformation (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a lion shaman may adopt an aspect of the lion while retaining her normal form. This ability functions as the bear shaman ability, but the druid may select from the following bonuses: movement (+20 enhancement bonus to land speed), senses (low-light vision, scent), or natural weapons (bite [1d4], 2 claws [1d4] for a Medium druid, rake, +2 CMB to grapple). While using totem transformation, the lion shaman may speak normally and can cast speak with animals (felines only) at will.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex) </b>: Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that utilize or target plants, such as <i>blight </i>, <i>entangle </i>, <i>spike growth </i>, and <i>warp wood </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Totemic Summons (Su): </b>At 5th level, a lion shaman may cast summon nature&#146;s ally as a standard action when summoning felines, and these summoned creatures gain temporary hit points equal to her druid level. This ability otherwise functions as the bear shaman ability</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 6th level, a lion shaman&#146;s wild shape ability functions at her druid level &#150; 2. If she takes on the form of a feline, she instead uses her druid level + 2.</p>
			<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat: </b>At 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter, a lion shaman gains one of the following bonus feats: Dodge, Lunge, Improved Iron Will, Iron Will, or Skill Focus (Acrobatics). She must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats. This ability replaces venom immunity.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

The life channeler gains one wicker talisman corresponding to each level of druid spells she can cast, starting with 1st-level spells. These talismans are initially empty, but can hold life energy. When the life channeler ritualistically kills a creature with a coup de grace, she can store life energy in a talisman instead of gaining the plant growth effect. The creature must be of a CR equal to at least twice the spell level of the corresponding talisman. For instance, a CR 8 creature&#146;s life energy could provide energy for a talisman holding up to a 4th-level spell. A talisman is either full or empty; it can&#146;t hold more than one creature&#146;s life energy.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Life channelers take the natural cycle to what they believe is its logical conclusion. By sacrificing the life of a sentient creature, they can generate energy that guarantees fertility and prosperity for lower creatures like plants and animals. These druids preach to flocks who become willing sacrifices, each serving as a &#147;king&#148; or &#147;queen&#148; for a short time after being chosen as the next sacrifice.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral. In addition to a druid&#146;s usual alignment requirements, a life channeler must be of a nongood alignment. If she becomes good, she can no longer take levels in the druid class or fill her wicker talismans (see below), but she otherwise keeps all her abilities.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex) </b>: Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that utilize or target plants, such as <i>blight </i>, <i>entangle </i>, <i>spike growth </i>, and <i>warp wood </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Venom Immunity (Ex) </b>: At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

So long as the leshy lives, the leshy warden gains access to the Plant domain as if through a druid&#146;s nature bond class feature, but she can&#146;t choose the Decay subdomain.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The natural world is full of bodiless nature spirits connected to the forces of glades, springs, and individual plants. Some druids hear their call keenly and are able to effortlessly incarnate them as the miniature creatures known as leshys (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 176). The leshy warden serves as these spirits&#146; ally, defender, and voice.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Green Empathy (Ex): </b>A leshy warden can improve the attitude of a plant creature as if using wild empathy. The typical wild plant creature has a starting attitude of indifferent. If the plant creature is mindless, the leshy warden imparts a modicum of intellect to the plant so that it can be interacted with as if it were an animal. A leshy warden can also use this ability to influence an animal, but she takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check to do so.</p>
			<p><b>Leshy Familiar (Ex): </b>A leshy warden forms an intimate bond with a nature spirit, incarnating the spirit as a leaf leshy (Bestiary 3 179). She gains a leaf leshy as a familiar and treats her druid level as her effective wizard level for the purpose of this ability. If the leshy dies, the leshy warden can incarnate the same spirit again by paying the normal cost to replace a familiar. So long as the leshy lives, the leshy warden gains access to the Plant domain as if through a druid&#146;s nature bond class feature, but she can&#146;t choose the Decay subdomain.</p>
			<p><b>Leshy Summoner (Ex): </b>A leshy warden is an expert at summoning and growing leshys. She counts as a plant creature for the purpose of growing leshys. She adds leaf leshys, gourd leshys, fungus leshys, seaweed leshys, and lotus leshys to her list of creatures she can summon with summon nature&#146;s ally I, II, III, IV, and V, respectively.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Leshy Tender (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a leshy warden can either grant her leaf leshy a +2 increase to Strength and Dexterity or transform it into a gourd leshy. At 8th level, the leshy warden can either grant her current leshy a +2 increase to Strength and Dexterity or transform it into a fungus leshy. At 12th level, she can either grant her current leshy a final +2 increase to Strength and Dexterity or transform it into a seaweed leshy. If the leshy is transformed, it gains the normal ability scores of its new form; ability score increases granted by this ability don&#146;t carry over to its new form.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: A leshy warden gains this ability at 6th level, except her effective druid level for the ability is equal to her druid level &#150; 2 for the purpose of determining the number of times per day she can use it. At 6th level, the leshy warden can assume the form of only Small or Medium plant creatures, as per plant shape I. At 8th level, she can take the form of a Large plant creature, as per plant shape II. At 10th level, she can take the form of a Huge plant creature, as per plant shape III.</p>
			<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Venom Immunity (Ex) </b>: At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>
			<p><b>Plant Whisperer (Su): </b>At 13th level, a leshy warden&#146;s connection to the spirits of nature becomes strong enough that she can always hear them whispering. She is treated as if constantly under the effects of speak with plants. Once per day, she can spend 10 minutes in communion with the spirits to learn the answers to her questions, as commune with nature.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

			<druidnaturebond_1>
				<level type="number">1</level>
				<name type="string">Nature bond</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
					<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>

					<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A kraken caller&#146;s options for wild shape are limited to animals with the aquatic or water subtype or that have the amphibious special quality. The kraken caller can alternatively expend a daily use of wild shape to grow tentacles out of her body while otherwise retaining her own form. This effect lasts for 10 minutes per level, or until the kraken caller changes back.</p>
					<p>At 4th level, the kraken caller grows two tentacles while in this form. The tentacles have a reach of 5 feet regardless of the kraken caller&#146;s size, and the kraken caller can use them as secondary natural attacks that deal 1d4 points of damage (1d3 for a Small kraken caller). She also gains a racial bonus on Climb, Swim, and dirty trick combat maneuver checks equal to the number of tentacles grown.</p>
					<p>At each of 6th, 8th, 10th, and 12th levels, a kraken caller can grow an additional tentacle. As a move action, she can retract or regrow any number of the additional tentacles, redistributing the mass of any retracted tentacles. For every 2 retracted tentacles, she can increase the reach of the remaining tentacles by 5 feet (to a maximum of 15 feet), or increase the damage dealt by her tentacles as if she were one size category larger.</p>
					<p>While in this form, a kraken caller can expel a 10-footradius cloud of ink once per minute as a standard action. This cloud provides total concealment in water and persists for 1 round per level. The ink has no effect out of water. This ability alters wild shape.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some druids draw upon power irreverently stolen from one of the most dangerous creatures of the depths: the kraken.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<p><b>Deity: </b>Besmara</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A kraken caller&#146;s bonus language options include Aquan instead of Sylvan.</p>
			<p>A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex) </b>: Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that utilize or target plants, such as <i>blight </i>, <i>entangle </i>, <i>spike growth </i>, and <i>warp wood </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: A kraken caller&#146;s options for wild shape are limited to animals with the aquatic or water subtype or that have the amphibious special quality. The kraken caller can alternatively expend a daily use of wild shape to grow tentacles out of her body while otherwise retaining her own form. This effect lasts for 10 minutes per level, or until the kraken caller changes back.</p>
			<p>At 4th level, the kraken caller grows two tentacles while in this form. The tentacles have a reach of 5 feet regardless of the kraken caller&#146;s size, and the kraken caller can use them as secondary natural attacks that deal 1d4 points of damage (1d3 for a Small kraken caller). She also gains a racial bonus on Climb, Swim, and dirty trick combat maneuver checks equal to the number of tentacles grown.</p>
			<p>At each of 6th, 8th, 10th, and 12th levels, a kraken caller can grow an additional tentacle. As a move action, she can retract or regrow any number of the additional tentacles, redistributing the mass of any retracted tentacles. For every 2 retracted tentacles, she can increase the reach of the remaining tentacles by 5 feet (to a maximum of 15 feet), or increase the damage dealt by her tentacles as if she were one size category larger.</p>
			<p>While in this form, a kraken caller can expel a 10-footradius cloud of ink once per minute as a standard action. This cloud provides total concealment in water and persists for 1 round per level. The ink has no effect out of water. This ability alters wild shape.</p>
			<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Venom Immunity (Ex) </b>: At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>
			<p><b>Beast of the Depths (Su): </b>At 13th level, a kraken caller gains a swim speed equal to her base land speed and can breathe water as though affected by the spell water breathing. This ability replaces a thousand faces.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>

					<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The fecund jungles of the equatorial regions are rich in life and ancient tradition; druidical guardians of sacred pools, elder trees, and trembling volcanoes watch over crumbling temples and the inevitable reclamation of lost civilizations by the beating heart of nature untamed.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Jungle Guardian (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a jungle druid gains a bonus on Initiative checks and Climb, Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks equal to 1/2 her druid level in jungle terrain, and she cannot be tracked in such environments. This ability replaces woodland stride.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>A jungle druid gains this ability at 3rd level. This ability replaces trackless step.</p>
			<p><b>Torrid Endurance (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a jungle druid ignores the effects of a hot climate as if under the effects of endure elements. She also gains a +4 bonus on saves against disease and the exceptional abilities of animals and magical beasts. This ability replaces resist nature&#146;s lure.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: A jungle druid gains this ability at 6th level, except that her effective druid level for the ability is equal to her druid level &#150; 2.</p>
			<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Venom Immunity (Ex) </b>: At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>
			<p><b>Verdant Sentinel (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a jungle druid can cast tree shape at will. This ability replaces a thousand faces.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

If the assumed form has immunity to a condition, the druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against effects that cause that condition.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Druids of the Halcyon Circle embrace the teachings of Old-Mage Jatembe, combining them with traditional druidic practices. Though they revere the natural world, halcyon druids are less focused on emulating its inhabitants. Instead, like Old-Mage Jatembe, they treat with beings from the Outer Sphere. As a sign of their allegiance, these druids wear fantastical masks depicting celestials, fiends, and&#151; most often&#151;the bestial agathions.</i></p>
			<p><i>Halcyon druids are peacekeepers, mediating between people and nature, people and the spirit world, and different groups of people. Yet when necessary, they use their magic to fight enemies of peace, especially demons and demon cultists.</i></p>
			<p><i>Most halcyon druids serve Nantambu and the surrounding villages&#151;making, memorizing, and arbitrating the unwritten pacts between them. Some halcyon druids, however, are drawn farther afield. They may do so to forge new connections between tribes and villages, to spread the message of peace, or to fight demonic outbreaks.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Bonded Mask (Su): </b>A halcyon druid forms a powerful bond with a mask, which functions identically to a wizard&#146;s bonded object except that it can be used to cast druid spells (including those gained from class abilities) instead of wizard spells. A bonded mask must be worn to have an effect, and it occupies the head slot. A halcyon druid can enhance her mask with abilities appropriate for a head slot item, and can designate an existing head slot item as her bonded mask (but only if it covers her face).</p>
			<p><b>Magaambya-Trained (Ex): </b>A halcyon druid adds Diplomacy and all Knowledge skills to her list of class skills.</p>
			<p><b>Peacekeeper (Ex): </b>A halcyon druid adds half her class level (minimum 1) to Diplomacy and Knowledge (local) checks.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A halcyon druid adds all spells from the Good cleric domain to her druid spell list, and she can focus stored spell energy into spells from the Good domain that she hasn&#146;t prepared ahead of time. She can lose a prepared spell to cast any spell of the same level or lower from the Good domain.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Natural Arcana (Su): </b>At 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a halcyon druid chooses two spells from the wizard/sorcerer spell list and adds them to her druid spell list. The chosen spells must be at least 1 level lower than the highest level spell she can currently cast. At 20th level, the halcyon druid can choose wizard/sorcerer spells of any level.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Fiendish Influence (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a halcyon druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of outsiders with the evil subtype and spells with the evil descriptor.</p>
			<p><b>Venom Immunity (Ex) </b>: At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>
			<p><b>Embody Mask (Sp): </b>At 13th level, a halcyon druid wearing her bonded mask can embody the spirit it represents, which can be any Tiny to Large agathion, angel, archon, or azata. This ability requires a standard action to activate and functions as per beast shape IV (using the adjustments for magical beasts), but adds the following abilities if the assumed form has them: aura of menace, protective aura, speak with animals, telepathy, and truespeech. If the assumed form has immunity to a condition, the druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against effects that cause that condition. A halcyon druid can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her druid level. The duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be used in 1-minute increments.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

				<name type="string">Nature bond</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
					<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>

					<p>A green scourge can lose a prepared 1st- or 2nd-level spell in order to cast shillelagh or flame blade, respectively. She can instead choose to lose a higher-level spell in order to increase the enhancement bonus of her shillelagh, or to add any of the following weapon special abilities to her shillelagh or flame blade: bane (aberrations only), frost, mighty cleaving, returning, shock, throwing, or vicious. If the target weapon is a quarterstaff, these bonuses apply to only one of its ends. If a flame blade gains the frost or shock special ability, the base damage of the spell changes to match the energy type; neither a flame blade nor shillelagh can gain both of these special abilities. A green scourge cannot add the throwing property to a flame blade unless she also adds the returning property.</p>
					<p>When adding weapon special abilities or increasing the enhancement bonus, the final level of the spell expended is 1 higher than the base spell level (2nd for shillelagh and 3rd for flame blade), increased by the additional special abilities&#146; total base price modifier (see Table 15&#150;9 on page 469 of the Core Rulebook). For example, creating an aberration-bane vicious flame blade requires spending a 5th-level spell slot, which also counts as a 5th-level spell for purposes of dispelling.</p>

				<name type="string">Wild shape (4/day)</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the beast shape I spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
					<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
					<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as beast shape II . When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as elemental body I.</p>
					<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as beast shape III . When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as elemental body II. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as plant shape I .</p>
					<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as elemental body III . When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as plant shape II .</p>
					<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Green scourges are militant druids sworn to restore natural order. They&#146;re less concerned with nurturing the natural world than most druids, instead focusing their efforts on slaying corrupted creatures.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Aberration Sense (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a green scourge adds Knowledge (dungeoneering) to her class skills and gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (dungeoneering) checks.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature&#146;s Armaments: </b>A green scourge can lose a prepared 1st- or 2nd-level spell in order to cast shillelagh or flame blade, respectively. She can instead choose to lose a higher-level spell in order to increase the enhancement bonus of her shillelagh, or to add any of the following weapon special abilities to her shillelagh or flame blade: bane (aberrations only), frost, mighty cleaving, returning, shock, throwing, or vicious. If the target weapon is a quarterstaff, these bonuses apply to only one of its ends. If a flame blade gains the frost or shock special ability, the base damage of the spell changes to match the energy type; neither a flame blade nor shillelagh can gain both of these special abilities. A green scourge cannot add the throwing property to a flame blade unless she also adds the returning property.</p>
			<p>When adding weapon special abilities or increasing the enhancement bonus, the final level of the spell expended is 1 higher than the base spell level (2nd for shillelagh and 3rd for flame blade), increased by the additional special abilities&#146; total base price modifier (see Table 15&#150;9 on page 469 of the Core Rulebook). For example, creating an aberration-bane vicious flame blade requires spending a 5th-level spell slot, which also counts as a 5th-level spell for purposes of dispelling.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Scentless (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a green scourge cannot be detected or tracked with the scent ability or any other special senses that rely on acute smell. She can choose to exude a scent if desired.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Unnatural Influence (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a green scourge gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against aberrations&#146; spelllike abilities, supernatural abilities, and poisons.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Venom Immunity (Ex) </b>: At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Druids who are initiated into the magic of nature as strict students of the Green Faith&#146;s traditions sometimes demonstrate abilities unique to their organization.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Mediator&#146;s Ear (Ex): </b>By 3rd level, a Green Faith initiate is respected for her neutrality and even-handed attitude toward all people as well as other living things. She quickly develops a sense of other peoples&#146; attitudes, much as she does with animals. A Green Faith initiate gains a bonus on Diplomacy and Sense Motive checks equal to half her druid level.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex) </b>: Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that utilize or target plants, such as <i>blight </i>, <i>entangle </i>, <i>spike growth </i>, and <i>warp wood </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Zephyr Message (Sp): </b>At 6th level, once per day, a Green Faith initiate can cast whispering wind as a spell-like ability, treating her druid level as her caster level.</p>
			<p><b>Path to Refuge (Sp): </b>At 9th level, once per day, a Green Faith initiate can travel as if with transport via plants to any major Green Faith druid circle or important holy site. Each of these sites is marked with special standing stones that allow all Green Faith followers within range using transport via plants or tree stride to sense their distance from it and the direction to it. At 14th level and again at 19th level, she can use this ability one additional time per day.</p>
			<p><b>Secrets across Lifetimes (Sp): </b>At 10th level, a Green Faith initiate can use legend lore once per week as a spell-like ability, drawing upon the knowledge of Green Faith archdruids recorded in secret across the generations in places where magic such as this can retrieve it. This ability does not require material components.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Voices (Su): </b>At 13th level, a Green Faith initiate can communicate with any creature that has a language or with any stone, as if using tongues or stone tell, respectively, for up to 1 minute per druid level each day. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
					<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>

The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>

The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Goliath druids hone their spiritual and magical connections to nature&#146;s largest creatures, especially dinosaurs, giants, and megafauna, revering these massive creatures as living relics of a primeval time when all creatures were more in harmony with nature. Despite this respect, a goliath druid doesn&#146;t hesitate to infiltrate giant groups who defile nature and destroy them from within.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A goliath druid with an Intelligence bonus can select Giant as a bonus language.</p>
			<p>A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Primal Bond (Ex): </b>When a goliath druid forms a nature bond, if she selects a cleric domain, she must selected from the Animal, Destruction, or Strength domains, or the Ferocity, Growth, or Rage subdomainsAPG.</p>
			<p>If the goliath druid selects an animal companion, she must select a dinosaur or megafauna. If she has a dinosaur or megafauna animal companion, she can target it with enlarge person even though the companion isn&#146;t of the humanoid type.</p>
			<p><b>Primal Empathy (Ex): </b>A goliath druid&#146;s wild empathy functions only with creatures that are Large or larger. This ability alters wild empathy.</p>
			<p><b>Primal Size: </b>A goliath druid adds enlarge person to her list of class spells. She can cast this spell only on herself. She can also channel stored spell energy to cast this spell without preparing it&#151;she can lose a prepared spell of 1st level or higher to cast enlarge person. This ability replaces nature sense.</p>
			<p><b>Primal Summons: </b>A goliath druid adds the following creatures to the list of creatures she can normally summon using summon nature&#146;s ally spells.</p>
			<p>Summon Nature&#146;s Ally I: Compsognathus.</p>
			<p>Summon Nature&#146;s Ally II: Dimorphodon.</p>
			<p>Summon Nature&#146;s Ally III: Velociraptor.</p>
			<p>Summon Nature&#146;s Ally IV: Ogre, parasaurolophus.</p>
			<p>Summon Nature&#146;s Ally V: Glyptodon, iguanodon.</p>
			<p>Summon Nature&#146;s Ally VI: Baluchitherium, megalania.</p>
			<p>Summon Nature&#146;s Ally VII: Cliff giant.</p>
			<p>Summon Nature&#146;s Ally VIII: Spinosaurus.</p>
			<p>Summon Nature&#146;s Ally IX: Diplodocus.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces venom immunity and a thousand faces.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Face Nature&#146;s Might (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a goliath druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of giants. This ability replaces resist nature&#146;s lure.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: Druids&#146; ability to wild shape into a creature of the animal type allows a goliath druid to assume only the form of a dinosaur or megafauna. She doesn&#146;t gain the ability to become an elemental or plant.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, the goliath druid can use wild shape to become a Large humanoid of the giant subtype. This functions as the alter self spell, except the goliath druid gains a +4 size bonus to Strength, a &#150;2 penalty to Dexterity, and a +1 natural armor bonus. If the Large humanoid form she takes has rock throwing, she gains rock throwing (range 40 feet, 1d8 damage). If the form has the aquatic subtype, she gains the aquatic and amphibious subtypes.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, when taking the form of a giant, the goliath druid&#146;s wild shape functions as giant form I.</p>
			<p>At 14th level, the goliath druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge giant. When taking the form of a giant, the goliath druid&#146;s wild shape functions as giant form II.</p>
			<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Venom Immunity (Ex) </b>: At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Druids often work to preserve the natural world, but some seek to further emulate it. Fungal pilgrims are druids seeking transformation into a more plantlike existence. These unique adherents of nature&#146;s creed see fungi as the means to such ends, as many fungi&#151;particularly those of the Darklands&#151; naturally work their way into the bodies of living creatures.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Devotion to Ascension (Ex): </b>A fungal pilgrim must select the Plant domain for her nature bond if she does not select an animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Fungal Companion: </b>At 4th level, a fungal pilgrim who selected an animal companion for her nature bond initiates a transformation in her companion. The animal companion gains the fungal creature template (Bestiary 4 116), but does not gain the create spawn, poison spore cloud, and poisonous blood special attacks. At 10th level, the animal companion gains the poisonous blood special attack. At 14th level, the animal companion gains the poison spore cloud special attack. At 20th level, the animal companion gains the create spawn special attack; created spawn are under the control of the fungal pilgrim. Spawn created in this way last for only 48 hours before rotting away.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex) </b>: Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that utilize or target plants, such as <i>blight </i>, <i>entangle </i>, <i>spike growth </i>, and <i>warp wood </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Spore Spawning: </b>At 4th level, a fungal pilgrim who selected the Plant domain for her nature bond gains the ability to grow fungal creatures from the spores of her body. Once per day, when casting a summon nature&#146;s ally spell to summon a single creature, the fungal pilgrim can infuse her fungal connection into the casting. The creature summoned must be selected from the summon nature&#146;s ally list for 1 spell level lower than the spell cast. For example, if the fungal pilgrim casts summon nature&#146;s ally III, she must choose a creature from the list in summon nature&#146;s ally II.</p>
			<p>Creatures summoned in this manner gain the fungal creature template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 116), except they do not gain the create spawn and poison spore cloud special attacks. A creature summoned in this manner cannot be harvested for its poison.</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every 2 levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, it can be used any number of times per day.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Venom Immunity (Ex) </b>: At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Mycological Transformation (Ex): </b>Fungal spores become fully integrated into the druid&#146;s body, inside and out. At 15th level, she gains all immunities granted by the plant creature type as well as the light sensitivity universal monster rule. She counts as a plant for the purposes of effects that would negatively affect or damage plants. In addition, she no longer needs to eat or sleep in the typical manner, and instead gains the fungal creature&#146;s rejuvenation ability. She can perform her daily meditation during her rejuvenation.</p>

The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form.

					<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
					<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as beast shape II . When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as elemental body I.</p>
					<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature.

					<p>At 1st level, a feyspeaker can fool an animal into thinking there is food, a potential mate, or a predator nearby. This ability functions just like a Bluff check to deceive a character. To determine the result of the wild mischief check, the feyspeaker rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier. As with Bluff checks, wild mischief checks are modified depending on the believability of the false information. A typical domestic animal is not particularly suspicious of the feyspeaker (no circumstance modifier), whereas wild animals are usually suspicious (&#150;5 penalty on the check). To use wild mischief, the feyspeaker and the animal must be able to study each other, which means they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but as when influencing people, it could take more or less time. A feyspeaker can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>

In addition, the feyspeaker gains a number of skill ranks at each level equal to 6 + her Intelligence modifier, instead of 4 + her Intelligence modifier.

At 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 18th levels, a feyspeaker adds one enchantment or illusion spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list to her druid spell list as a spell of 1 level higher (for instance, at 4th level, she could add color spray as a 2nd-level druid spell).

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some druids hear the whispers of the natural world like fey creatures do, and learn to mimic those tantalizing murmurs in order to influence the minds of both wild beasts and civilized people. These feyspeakers are often touched by the fey in some way, such as mortals who dared to eat the food and drink the wine while in the hidden halls of the fey.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Fey Magic: </b>At 1st level, a feyspeaker allows the strange idylls of the fey to guide her magic. The feyspeaker uses her Charisma score instead of her Wisdom score as her key spellcasting ability score (to determine her spell DCs, bonus spells per day, concentration checks, and so on). At 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 18th levels, a feyspeaker adds one enchantment or illusion spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list to her druid spell list as a spell of 1 level higher (for instance, at 4th level, she could add color spray as a 2nd-level druid spell). In order to select a spell, she must be of a level high enough (including the increased spell level) to cast it. Once selected, the spell cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>A feyspeaker loses the ability to spontaneously cast summon nature&#146;s ally spells. She gains the wild shape ability at 6th level and gains all benefits related to wild shape 2 druid levels later than usual. She can never use wild shape to transform into an elemental.</p>
			<p><b>Fey Speech (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a feyspeaker&#146;s words carry a tiny fragment of the otherworldly power of the fey&#146;s voices. She gains Bluff, Diplomacy, Disguise, and Sense Motive as class skills. A feyspeaker also learns Sylvan as a bonus language. In addition, the feyspeaker gains a number of skill ranks at each level equal to 6 + her Intelligence modifier, instead of 4 + her Intelligence modifier. The feyspeaker&#146;s base attack bonus from her druid levels is equal to half her druid level (much like a sorcerer&#146;s base attack bonus is calculated), rather than the usual druid base attack bonus.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Mischief (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a feyspeaker can fool an animal into thinking there is food, a potential mate, or a predator nearby. This ability functions just like a Bluff check to deceive a character. To determine the result of the wild mischief check, the feyspeaker rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier. As with Bluff checks, wild mischief checks are modified depending on the believability of the false information. A typical domestic animal is not particularly suspicious of the feyspeaker (no circumstance modifier), whereas wild animals are usually suspicious (&#150;5 penalty on the check). To use wild mischief, the feyspeaker and the animal must be able to study each other, which means they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but as when influencing people, it could take more or less time. A feyspeaker can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex) </b>: Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that utilize or target plants, such as <i>blight </i>, <i>entangle </i>, <i>spike growth </i>, and <i>warp wood </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Venom Immunity (Ex) </b>: At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

					<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as beast shape II . When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as elemental body I.</p>
					<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as beast shape III . When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as elemental body II.

					<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A feral shifter internalizes her communion with and mastery over animals. Instead of forming a bond with an animal companion or an aspect of nature, she alters her own essence or being as homage to the noble creatures of the wild. More in tune with transformation and animal bodies than a normal druid, a feral shifter blurs the line between humanoid and beast.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Animal Focus (Su): </b>At 1st level, as a swift action, a feral shifter can take on the aspect of an animal, gaining a bonus or special ability based on the type of animal emulated. This functions as the hunter&#146;s animal focus class feature (see page 27). The feral shifter can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her druid level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. She can emulate only one animal at a time. This ability replaces nature bond.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex) </b>: Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that utilize or target plants, such as <i>blight </i>, <i>entangle </i>, <i>spike growth </i>, and <i>warp wood </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form.

			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Second Animal Focus (Su): </b>At 9th level, when a feral shifter uses her animal focus ability, she selects two different animal aspects for herself instead of one. This ability replaces venom immunity, a thousand faces, and timeless body.</p>

					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
					<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>

Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some youths, abandoned in the wilderness and then raised by animals, are so connected with their adoptive home and family that they become feral. Suspicious of civilized society, these foundlings often choose allegiance to the wild over their human forebears. A feral child has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Beast Family (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a feral child may choose one specific type of animal as the type that raised her. She gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Handle Animal and wild empathy checks with animals of that type, and she can communicate with them as if using a continual speak with animals spell-like ability, but this ability is nonmagical.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Illiteracy: </b>At 1st level, a feral child is unable to read and write, though she may learn by taking 1 rank of Linguistics. She does not gain Druidic as a free language and cannot select Sylvan as a bonus language.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Unarmed Strike: </b>At 1st level, a feral child gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a feral child must select an animal companion as her nature bond.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a feral child gains the favored terrain ability as a ranger of her class level. A feral child may not choose urban as a favored terrain. This ability replaces trackless step and a thousand faces.</p>
			<p><b>Native Cunning (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a feral child gains trap sense as a barbarian of equal level, and in her favored terrain, she immediately receives a Perception check to notice traps within 10 feet, as the trap spotter rogue talent. In addition, at 3rd level and every three levels thereafter, she may choose one combat maneuver, and gains a bonus equal to her trap sense bonus to her CMD against that maneuver. This ability replaces wild shape.</p>
			<p><b>Native Fortitude (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a feral child gains a +1 bonus on saving throws against disease, exhaustion, fatigue, fear, and poison. When she is in her favored terrain, she instead applies her favored terrain bonus on such saving throws. She also recovers from ability damage, exhaustion, and fatigue at twice the normal rate. This ability replaces resist nature&#146;s lure.</p>
			<p><b>Native Call (Su): </b>At 9th level, when in her favored terrain, for any summon nature&#146;s ally spells a feral child uses to summon animals that are native to that terrain, she treats the duration of the spell as if she were 2 levels higher.</p>
			<p>At 17th level, when the feral child uses summon nature&#146;s ally spells to summon such animals, those animals gain a +2 bonus to both their Strength and Constitution ability scores. This stacks with the effects of the Augmented Summoning feat.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>

					<p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
					<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level.

Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity.

(The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
					<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
					<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as beast shape II . When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as elemental body I.</p>
					<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>An elemental ally is a druid who has crafted powerful bonds of trust and friendship with one ally from each of the four primary elemental planes. Elemental allies are most common in Qadira, where they are considered similar to genie-binders.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Elemental Eidolons: </b>At 1st level, an elemental ally has four elemental eidolons she can summon, one each for the elements of air, earth, fire, and water. Their abilities and statistics are determined using the rules for elemental eidolons for the summoner class from page 33 of Pathfinder RPG Pathfinder Unchained, as if the elemental ally were a summoner of her druid level, except they gain no additional evolution pool ( just those evolutions from their base form and base evolutions from their subtype).</p>
			<p>Each of the four elementals has its own base form, skills, and feats. The elemental ally can summon one of these elementals with the same 1-minute ritual a summoner normally uses to do so. The elemental ally can&#146;t summon an eidolon or cast summon nature&#146;s ally if she currently has an eidolon summoned. She also can&#146;t summon an eidolon if she currently has a creature summoned through other means. If one of the elemental ally&#146;s eidolons is killed, she cannot summon any eidolons for 24 hours. The elemental ally can dismiss her eidolon as a standard action.</p>
			<p>As the elemental ally gains levels, her elemental eidolons&#146; base statistics and base evolutions increase as if her druid level were her summoner level. The eidolons gain the darkvision, link, share spells, evasion, ability score increase, devotion, multiattack, and improved evasion abilities at the appropriate levels, but never gain an evolution pool. Abilities and spells that grant additional evolution points to eidolons do not function for elemental eidolons, though any ability that would grant evolution points to an animal companion does work. The elemental ally does not gain life link or any other class features a summoner gains in relation to her eidolon.</p>
			<p><b>Elemental Empathy (Ex): </b>An elemental ally can improve the attitude of a creature of the elemental subtype. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person. The elemental ally rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the elemental empathy check result.</p>
			<p>To use elemental empathy, the elemental ally and the elemental must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, inf luencing an elemental in this way takes 1 minute, but as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>An elemental ally can also use this ability to influence a non-elemental outsider with the air, earth, fire, or water subtype, but she takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Elemental Magic: </b>The elemental ally can target elementals (including her elemental eidolons) with any spell she casts that targets animals, even though elementals can&#146;t normally be targeted by such spells.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Elemental Resistance (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an elemental ally gains resist acid, cold, electricity, and fire 5. This ability replaces resist nature&#146;s lure.</p>
			<p><b>Venom Immunity (Ex) </b>: At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Droviers view their allies and adventuring companions as a herd or pack to be protected and directed, with variations on that theme ranging from culture to culture. The orcs of Belkzen see droviers as alpha predators, offering tribal warriors totemic power in exchange for obedience in combat. The elves of the Mwangi Expanse regard them as spokespeople for the jungle, adopting aspects that help preserve and defend the land.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor.

Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: A drovier must take the Animal domain with this ability, or the Eagle or Wolf animal domains.</p>

			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>

Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex) </b>: Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that utilize or target plants, such as <i>blight </i>, <i>entangle </i>, <i>spike growth </i>, and <i>warp wood </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Communal Aspect (Su): </b>At 4th level, a drovier can imbue her allies (including herself) with an aspect of a wild animal.

At 8th level, the drovier can choose to grant her allies the benefits of the spell aspect of the falconAPG instead of an animal aspect. At 10th level, the drovier can choose to grant her allies the benefits of the spell aspect of the bearAPG instead of an animal aspect. At 12th level, the drovier can choose to grant her allies the benefits of the spell aspect of the stagAPG instead of an animal aspect. At 14th level, the drovier can choose to grant her allies the benefits of the spell aspect of the wolfAPG rather than an animal aspect.</p>
			<p><b>Venom Immunity (Ex) </b>: At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>

					<p>An eagle shaman who chooses an animal companion must select a bird (eagle). If choosing a domain, the eagle shaman must choose from the Air, Animal, Nobility, and Weather domains.</p>
					<p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
					<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>

In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>

					<p>An eagle shaman can use wild empathy with birds as a full-round action with a +4 bonus.</p>
					<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A shaman with this totem calls upon the noble eagle, stern and proud, soaring high above the world with keen and pitiless eyes that miss nothing.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: An eagle shaman who chooses an animal companion must select a bird (eagle). If choosing a domain, the eagle shaman must choose from the Air, Animal, Nobility, and Weather domains.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: An eagle shaman can use wild empathy with birds as a full-round action with a +4 bonus.</p>
			<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Totem Transformation (Su): </b>At 2nd level, an eagle shaman may adopt an aspect of the eagle while retaining her normal form. This ability functions as the bear shaman ability, but the druid may select from the following bonuses: movement (fly speed 30 feet [average], the druid must be 5th level to select this bonus), senses (low-light vision, +4 racial bonus to Perception), or natural weapons (bite [1d4], 2 talons [1d4] for a Medium shaman). While using totem transformation, the eagle shaman may speak normally and can cast speak with animals (birds only) at will.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex) </b>: Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that utilize or target plants, such as <i>blight </i>, <i>entangle </i>, <i>spike growth </i>, and <i>warp wood </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Totemic Summons (Su): </b>At 5th level, an eagle shaman may cast summon nature&#146;s ally as a standard action when summoning eagles, rocs, and giant eagles (added to the 4th-level list), and these summoned creatures gain temporary hit points equal to her druid level. This ability otherwise functions as the bear shaman ability.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 6th level, an eagle shaman&#146;s wild shape ability functions at her druid level &#150; 2. If she takes on the form of an eagle or roc, she instead uses her druid level + 2.</p>
			<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat: </b>At 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter, an eagle shaman gains one of the following bonus feats: Flyby Attack, Improved Lightning Reflexes, Lightning Reflexes, Skill Focus (Perception), or Wind Stance. She must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats. This ability replaces venom immunity.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>

					<p>A dragon shaman who chooses an animal companion must select a crocodile or monitor lizard. If choosing a domain, the dragon shaman must choose from the Air, Animal, Destruction, Earth, Fire, War, and Water domains.</p>
					<p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
					<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>

In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells.

					<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Your totem is the legendary dragon, fearsome and deadly yet cunning and wise, a creature born of pure magic and raw elemental fury, bound within a shell of fangs, claws, and scales that few dare to challenge. Though your initial focus is on dragons&#146; mundane cousins, as your powers grow you become attuned to actual dragons.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: A dragon shaman who chooses an animal companion must select a crocodile or monitor lizard. If choosing a domain, the dragon shaman must choose from the Air, Animal, Destruction, Earth, Fire, War, and Water domains.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A dragon shaman can use her wild empathy ability with lizards as a full-round action with a +4 bonus.</p>
			<p>A dragon shaman can use her wild empathy ability with lizards as a full-round action with a +4 bonus.</p>
			<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Totem Transformation (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a dragon shaman may adopt an aspect of the dragon while retaining her normal form. She gains one of the following bonuses: movement (fly speed 30 feet [average], the druid must be 5th level to select this bonus), senses (low-light vision, +4 racial bonus to Perception), toughness (+2 natural armor bonus to AC, Endurance feat), or natural weapons (bite [1d6] and 2 claws [1d4] for a Medium shaman, +2 bonus on CMB on grapple checks). While using totem transformation, the dragon shaman may speak normally and can cast speak with animals (lizards only) at will. Using this ability is a standard action at 2nd level, a move action at 7th level, and a swift action at 12th level. The dragon shaman can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her druid level. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but they must be used in 1-minute increments. This is a polymorph effect and cannot be used while the druid is using another polymorph effect, such as wild shape.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex) </b>: Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that utilize or target plants, such as <i>blight </i>, <i>entangle </i>, <i>spike growth </i>, and <i>warp wood </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Totemic Summons (Su): </b>At 5th level, a dragon shaman may cast summon nature&#146;s ally as a standard action when summoning lizards, and summoned lizards gain temporary hit points equal to her druid level. She can apply the young template to any lizard to reduce the level of the summoning spell required by one. She can also increase the level of summoning required by one in order to apply either the advanced or the giant template, or increase it by two to apply both the advanced and giant templates. This ability replaces a thousand faces.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 6th level, a dragon shaman&#146;s wild shape ability functions at her druid level &#150; 4. If she takes on the form of a lizard, she instead uses her unmodified druid level.</p>
			<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Dragon Bite (Su): </b>At 8th level, a dragon shaman&#146;s bite attack (whether using totem transformation or wild shape to take the form of a lizard) deals +1d6 points of energy damage (acid, cold, electricity, or fire). She chooses what kind of energy damage that she deals each time she bites. This ability replaces the additional use of wild shape at 8th level.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat: </b>At 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter, a dragon shaman gains one of the following bonus feats: Combat Casting, Dazzling Display, Magical Aptitude, Skill Focus (Knowledge [arcana]), and Spell Penetration. She must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats. This ability replaces venom immunity.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some druids believe that dragons are the ultimate expression of nature, combining elemental fury with majestic beauty. These druids consort with dragons and eventually transform into draconic forms.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Drake Companion: </b>A draconic druid gains a drake companion instead of an animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Dragon Sense: </b>A draconic druid studies dragons and their history. She gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (arcana) and Knowledge (history) checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Dragon's Might: </b>A draconic druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities of dragons.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>

					<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A dinosaur druid speaks for the spirit of prehistoric nature, even taking the form of great beasts of legend.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Summon Dinosaur (Sp): </b>A dinosaur druid can summon a wide range of dinosaurs and related prehistoric beasts using summon nature&#146;s ally spells. She adds the following options to these spells when using spontaneous casting to cast such a spell.</p>
			<p>Summon Nature&#146;s Ally I: Compsognathus.</p>
			<p>Summon Nature&#146;s Ally II: Dimorphodon, troodon.</p>
			<p>Summon Nature&#146;s Ally III: Plesiosaurus, velociraptor.</p>
			<p>Summon Nature&#146;s Ally IV: Dimetrodon, pachycephalosaurus, parasaurolophus.</p>
			<p>Summon Nature&#146;s Ally V: Amargasaurus, ceratosaurus, iguanodon, kentrosaurus, styracosaurus.</p>
			<p>Summon Nature&#146;s Ally VI: Allosaurus, quetzalcoatlus, tylosaurus.</p>
			<p>Summon Nature&#146;s Ally VII: Therizinosaurus.</p>
			<p>Summon Nature&#146;s Ally VIII: Diplodocus, spinosaurus.</p>
			<p>Summon Nature&#146;s Ally IX: Giganotosaurus.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Dinosaur Bond (Ex): </b>A dinosaur druid must choose an animal companion as her nature&#146;s bond, and the animal companion must be a dinosaur (including those detailed in Pathfinder RPG Bestiary volumes).</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Dinosaur Shape (Su): </b>A dinosaur druid specializes in assuming the form of dinosaurs when using wild shape. When she assumes the form of a dinosaur via wild shape, she gains a +2 size bonus to her Constitution in addition to the other modifiers granted by beast shape. When she uses wild shape to assume the form of a creature other than a dinosaur, the wild shape effect lasts for only 1 minute per level, rather than 1 hour per level.</p>
			<p><b>Primeval Voice (Su): </b>At 4th level, a dinosaur druid gains the ability to speak with dinosaurs (as per speak with animals) at all times.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Venom Immunity (Ex) </b>: At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor.

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
					<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion.

The animal no longer recognizes any humanoids as friends or allies and gladly tears former playmates apart for food. Handle Animal checks don&#146;t work on an undomesticated creature, though wild empathy does. This ability doesn&#146;t function on animal companions, special mounts, or the like, and other exceptional domesticated animals can attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the devolutionist&#146;s druid level + her Wisdom modifier) to negate the effect and become immune to it for 24 hours.

					<p>At 9th level, a devolutionist can perform a 24-hour ritual to irrevocably transform a humanoid or animal into a devolved feral state. There is no saving throw, but the target must be present and stay relatively still for the entire ritual, which typically requires a willing or restrained target. An affected humanoid&#146;s Intelligence score is instantly reduced to 2; its type changes to animal; it loses all spellcasting and abilities that require intelligence; it can&#146;t wield manufactured weapons; it gains two claw attacks and a bite attack (all dealing 1d4 points of damage for a Medium humanoid or 1d3 for Small humanoids); and it can&#146;t use skills other than Acrobatics, Climb, Escape Artist, Fly, Intimidate, Perception, Stealth, Survival, and Swim.</p>
					<p>An affected animal is undomesticated (see above) if applicable and then either gains the advanced template, except without any increases to mental ability scores, or becomes a dire version of the animal (if a dire version exists and at the GM&#146;s discretion). The devolved creature starts out friendly toward the devolutionist, though it typically tries to kill and devour other sentient humanoids. The devolutionist has no special empathy or connection with a creature she devolves, and if it was her animal companion before, it ceases to be so. The druid can communicate her desires to a devolved creature using wild empathy. This ability counters and dispels awaken, and only awaken, miracle, or wish can reverse it.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Full of simmering hatred toward civilization and those who dwell within it, devolutionists believe that the world would be better off without any sentient life at all. They transform intelligent creatures and domesticated animals into throwbacks to their feral ancestors.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Devolved Companion (Ex): </b>A devolutionist must choose a devolved humanoid as an animal companion for her nature bond. Use the stats for an ape animal companion, but at 4th level, the devolved humanoid doesn&#146;t increase to size Large (it still gains all the other benefits at 4th level).</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Undomesticate (Su): </b>At 4th level, a devolutionist can spend 1 minute with a willing or restrained domesticated animal to undo the effects of domestication, transforming it into a wild animal and causing it to lose any tricks it knew. The animal no longer recognizes any humanoids as friends or allies and gladly tears former playmates apart for food. Handle Animal checks don&#146;t work on an undomesticated creature, though wild empathy does. This ability doesn&#146;t function on animal companions, special mounts, or the like, and other exceptional domesticated animals can attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the devolutionist&#146;s druid level + her Wisdom modifier) to negate the effect and become immune to it for 24 hours. Though this ability is instantaneous, break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, or wish can reverse the effects.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Devolution (Sp): </b>At 9th level, a devolutionist can perform a 24-hour ritual to irrevocably transform a humanoid or animal into a devolved feral state. There is no saving throw, but the target must be present and stay relatively still for the entire ritual, which typically requires a willing or restrained target. An affected humanoid&#146;s Intelligence score is instantly reduced to 2; its type changes to animal; it loses all spellcasting and abilities that require intelligence; it can&#146;t wield manufactured weapons; it gains two claw attacks and a bite attack (all dealing 1d4 points of damage for a Medium humanoid or 1d3 for Small humanoids); and it can&#146;t use skills other than Acrobatics, Climb, Escape Artist, Fly, Intimidate, Perception, Stealth, Survival, and Swim.</p>
			<p>An affected animal is undomesticated (see above) if applicable and then either gains the advanced template, except without any increases to mental ability scores, or becomes a dire version of the animal (if a dire version exists and at the GM&#146;s discretion). The devolved creature starts out friendly toward the devolutionist, though it typically tries to kill and devour other sentient humanoids. The devolutionist has no special empathy or connection with a creature she devolves, and if it was her animal companion before, it ceases to be so. The druid can communicate her desires to a devolved creature using wild empathy. This ability counters and dispels awaken, and only awaken, miracle, or wish can reverse it.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Not all climates are verdant paradises, but even in the sere deserts there is life&#151;though often hidden from the sun and rarely friendly&#151;and raw, desolate beauty. Here desert druids come to pay homage, protect and maintain the few habitable locales, and witness nature&#146;s majesty in all its burning, merciless glory.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Desert Native (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a desert druid gains a bonus on Initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks equal to 1/2 her druid level in desert terrain, and she cannot be tracked in such environments. This ability replaces woodland stride.</p>
			<p><b>Sandwalker (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a desert druid suffers no penalty to speed or on Acrobatics or Stealth checks when moving through sandy or desert terrain. This ability replaces trackless step.</p>
			<p><b>Desert Endurance (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a desert druid ignores the effects of a hot climate as if using endure elements. She also has a reduced need to eat and drink, as if wearing a ring of sustenance (though normal sleep is still required). This ability replaces resist nature&#146;s lure.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: A desert druid gains this ability at 6th level, except that her effective druid level for the ability is equal to her druid level &#150; 2. A desert druid cannot use wild shape to adopt a plant form. At 10th level she can assume the form of a Small or Medium vermin, at 12th level a Tiny or Large vermin, and at 14th level a Diminutive or Huge vermin. This effect functions as beast shape IV (treating the vermin as an animal to determine its ability and natural armor modifiers).</p>
			<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Shaded Vision (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a desert druid becomes immune to blinding and dazzling effects and gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against gaze attacks and illusions of the figment and pattern subschools. This ability replaces venom immunity.</p>
			<p><b>Dunemeld (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a desert druid can assume the form of a swirling mass of sand at will. This is equivalent to gaseous form, but the druid gains a land and burrow speed of 10 feet rather than a fly speed. While in this form, the druid gains a circumstance bonus on Stealth checks made in desert terrain equal to her druid level. This ability replaces a thousand faces.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

				<name type="string">Nature bond</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
					<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some druids specialize in protecting Golarion from the threat of First World inhabitants. They are devoted to tracking down, diverting, and slaying fey threats.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A defender of the true world can select Aklo, Sylvan, or Undercommon as bonus languages, in addition to the normal list of bonus languages available.</p>
			<p>A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Enemy of the First World: </b>A defender of the true world cannot use summon nature&#146;s ally to summon fey creatures.</p>
			<p><b>Fey Empathy (Ex): </b>A defender of the true world gains a +2 competence bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks when interacting with fey creatures. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 druid levels she has (maximum +7 at 20th level).</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Fey Stalker (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, the defender of the true world&#146;s animal companion and any creatures she summons with summon nature&#146;s ally gain a +1 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls against fey creatures. This bonus increases to +2 at 8th level, +3 at 13th level, and +4 at 18th level.</p>
			<p><b>Feybane (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a defender of the true world doesn&#146;t gain a bonus on saving throws against spells and effects that utilize or target plants. She instead treats her natural attacks as cold iron for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction, and she gains a +2 bonus on caster level checks to overcome the spell resistance of fey creatures.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Beguiling Immunity (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a defender of the true world becomes immune to the mind-affecting effects of fey.</p>
			<p><b>First World Deceiver (Su): </b>At 13th level, a defender of the true world gains the ability to change her appearance as per alter self, except she can take the form of a humanoid or fey creature. Her base land speed from this ability cannot exceed 60 feet.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some druids believe that birth and death are the most important parts of the natural cycle. They focus on destroying undead and putting troubled souls to rest.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A cave druid may select the Darkness domain in addition to the choices normally allowed, but may not select the Air or Weather domains.</p>
					<p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
					<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>

					<p>A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A cave druid can influence oozes, rather than magical beasts, with a &#150;4 penalty on her wild empathy check.</p>
					<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

					<p>A cave druid gains this ability at 6th level, except that her effective druid level for this ability is equal to her druid level &#150;2. She cannot use wild shape to adopt a plant form. At 10th level, the cave druid can assume the form of a Small or Medium ooze as if using beast shape III, and at 12th level that of a Tiny or Large ooze as if using beast shape IV (treating the ooze as if it were a magical beast without a natural armor bonus). When in ooze form, the cave druid has no discernible anatomy and is immune to poison, sneak attacks, and critical hits.</p>
					<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the beast shape I spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
					<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Far from the green fields of the world above lies a lightless expanse beneath the surface. This darkling fairyland is not without beauty and natural wonders of its own, and a few druids seek to preserve this hidden realm and purge it of the fell horrors that creep up from below.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Cavesense (Ex): </b>A underground druid adds Knowledge (dungeoneering) rather than Knowledge (geography) as a class skill and gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (dungeoneering) and Survival skill checks</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: A cave druid may select the Darkness domain in addition to the choices normally allowed, but may not select the Air or Weather domains.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A cave druid can influence oozes, rather than magical beasts, with a &#150;4 penalty on her wild empathy check.</p>
			<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Tunnelrunner (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a cave druid can move through areas of rubble or narrow passages that require squeezing at her normal movement rate and without penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Lightfoot (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a cave druid cannot be detected with tremorsense.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Subterranean Corruption (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a cave druid gains a +2 bonus on saves against exceptional*, supernatural, and spell-like abilities of oozes and aberrations.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: A cave druid gains this ability at 6th level, except that her effective druid level for this ability is equal to her druid level &#150;2. She cannot use wild shape to adopt a plant form. At 10th level, the cave druid can assume the form of a Small or Medium ooze as if using beast shape III, and at 12th level that of a Tiny or Large ooze as if using beast shape IV (treating the ooze as if it were a magical beast without a natural armor bonus). When in ooze form, the cave druid has no discernible anatomy and is immune to poison, sneak attacks, and critical hits.</p>
			<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Venom Immunity (Ex) </b>: At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A boar shaman chooses the stolid and ferocious boar as her totem. Content to be left alone, she becomes one of the most dangerous creatures of the wild when provoked.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: A boar shaman who chooses an animal companion must select a boar. If choosing a domain, the boar shaman must choose from the Animal, Destruction (Rage subdomain), Protection, and Strength domains.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A boar shaman can use wild empathy with porcine creatures as a full-round action with a +4 bonus.</p>
			<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Totem Transformation (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a boar shaman may adopt an aspect of the boar while retaining her normal form. She gains one of the following bonuses:</p>
			<list>
				<li>movement (+10 enhancement bonus to land speed)</li>
				<li>senses (low-light vision, scent)</li>
				<li>natural weapons (gore [1d8 for a Medium druid], +2 on combat maneuver checks to overrun)</li>
				<li>toughness (+2 natural armor bonus to AC, Endurance feat)</li>
			</list>
			<p>While using totem transformation, the boar shaman may speak normally and can cast speak with animals (boars and related animals only) at will. Using this ability is a standard action at 2nd level, a move action at 7th level, and a swift action at 12th level. The boar shaman can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her druid level. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but they must be used in 1-minute increments. This is a polymorph effect and cannot be used while the druid is using another polymorph effect, such as wild shape.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex) </b>: Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that utilize or target plants, such as <i>blight </i>, <i>entangle </i>, <i>spike growth </i>, and <i>warp wood </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Totemic Summons (Su): </b>At 5th level, a boar shaman may cast summon nature&#146;s ally as a standard action when summoning boars or other porcine creatures, and these summoned creatures gain temporary hit points equal to her druid level. She can apply the young template to any boar or other porcine creature to reduce the level of the summoning spell required by one. She can also increase the level of summoning required by one in order to apply either the advanced or the giant template, or increase it by two to apply both the advanced and giant templates.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 6th level, a boar shaman&#146;s wild shape ability functions at her druid level &#150;2. If she takes on the form of a boar, she instead uses her druid level +2.</p>
			<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat: </b>At 9th level and every four levels thereafter, a boar shaman gains one of the following bonus feats: Bleeding Critical, Blind-Fight, Diehard, or Improved Overrun. She must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The devoted servants of nature corrupted, ruined, and destroyed, blight druids are the caretakers of lands ravaged by natural disaster. While some are devoted to reforming and reclaiming lands despoiled by the ravages of civilization, others seek out the more rapacious violence inherent in nature and feed the creeping rot and decay that brings an end to all things.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: A blight druid may not bond with an animal companion, but may either call a familiar as a wizard of her druid level or select from the Darkness, Death, and Destruction domains in addition to those normally available.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Vermin Empathy (Su): </b>A blight druid can improve the attitude of vermin as a normal druid can with animals. Vermin have a starting attitude of unfriendly. The blight druid can also improve the attitude of animals and mindless undead creatures that were formerly animals, but she takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check unless the animal or undead has a disease special attack.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex) </b>: Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that utilize or target plants, such as <i>blight </i>, <i>entangle </i>, <i>spike growth </i>, and <i>warp wood </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Miasma (Ex): </b>Starting at 5th level, if a blight druid is adjacent to a creature at the beginning of its turn, the creature must succeed at a Fortitude save with a DC of 10 + 1/2 the druid&#146;s level + the druid&#146;s Wisdom modifier or become sickened for 1 round. A creature of the animal, fey, or plant type that fails its save is nauseated for 1 round and sickened for 1 minute thereafter. If the creature makes its save, it is immune to this effect for 24 hours, as are creatures immune to disease.</p>
			<p><b>Blightblooded (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a blight druid gains immunity to all diseases, including natural and supernatural diseases. She also becomes immune to effects that would cause her to become sickened or nauseated.</p>
			<p><b>Plaguebearer (Su): </b>Starting at 13th level, any creature that strikes a blight druid with a touch attack, unarmed strike, or natural weapon must succeed at a Fortitude save with a DC of 10 + 1/2 the druid&#146;s level + the druid&#146;s Wisdom modifier or contract a disease, as the contagion spell. If the creature makes its save, it is immune to this effect for 24 hours.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A shaman with this focus calls upon the mighty bear, titan of the woodlands and mountains, a paragon of strength and ferocity, and yet also a quiet protector rich in wisdom.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: A bear shaman who chooses an animal companion must select a bear. If choosing a domain, the bear shaman must choose from the Animal, Earth, Protection, and Strength domains.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A bear shaman can use wild empathy with bears and wolverines as a full-round action with a +4 bonus.</p>
			<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Totem Transformation (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a bear shaman may adopt an aspect of the bear while retaining her normal form. She gains one of the following bonuses:</p>
			<list>
				<li>movement (+10 enhancement bonus to land speed, +4 racial bonus on Swim checks)</li>
				<li>senses (low-light vision, scent)</li>
				<li>toughness (+2 natural armor bonus to AC, Endurance feat)</li>
				<li>natural weapons (bite [1d6] and 2 claws [1d4] for a Medium shaman, +2 to CMB on grapple checks)</li>
			</list>
			<p>While using totem transformation, the bear shaman may speak normally and can cast speak with animals (mammals only) at will. Using this ability is a standard action at 2nd level, a move action at 7th level, and a swift action at 12th level. The bear shaman can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her druid level. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but they must be used in 1-minute increments. This is a polymorph effect and cannot be used while the druid is using another polymorph effect, such as wild shape.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex) </b>: Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that utilize or target plants, such as <i>blight </i>, <i>entangle </i>, <i>spike growth </i>, and <i>warp wood </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Totemic Summons (Su): </b>At 5th level, a bear shaman may cast summon nature&#146;s ally as a standard action when summoning bears, and summoned bears gain temporary hit points equal to her druid level. She can apply the young template to any bear to reduce the level of the summoning spell required by one. She can also increase the level of summoning required by one in order to apply either the advanced or the giant template, or increase it by two to apply both the advanced and giant templates.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 6th level, a bear shaman&#146;s wild shape ability functions at her druid level &#150; 2. If she takes on the form of a bear, she instead uses her druid level + 2.</p>
			<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat: </b>At 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter, a bear shaman gains one of the following bonus feats: Diehard, Endurance, Great Fortitude, Improved Great Fortitude, Toughness. She must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The bat shaman&#146;s totem is the agile bat, flitting and turning with incredible speed through even the most convoluted mazes. Her enemies do not know when she will appear, and when she does, she strikes fast and hard before disappearing into the night.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: A bat shaman who chooses an animal companion must select a bat. If choosing a domain, the bat shaman must choose from Air, Animal, Darkness (Night subdomain), and Trickery (Deception subdomain).</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A bat shaman can use wild empathy with bats as a full-round action with a +4 bonus.</p>
			<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Totem Transformation (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a bat shaman may adopt an aspect of the bat while retaining her normal form. This ability functions as the ape shaman ability, but the druid may select from the following sets of bonuses and abilities</p>
			<list>
				<li>movement (fly speed 30 ft. [average]; the druid must be at least 5th level to select this bonus)</li>
				<li>senses (blindsense 20 ft.)</li>
				<li>natural weapons (bite [1d4 for a Medium shaman])</li>
			</list>
			<p>While using totem transformation, the bat shaman may speak normally and can cast speak with animals (bats only) at will.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex) </b>: Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that utilize or target plants, such as <i>blight </i>, <i>entangle </i>, <i>spike growth </i>, and <i>warp wood </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Totemic Summons (Su): </b>At 5th level, an bat shaman may cast summon nature&#146;s ally as a standard action when summoning bats, and these summoned creatures gain temporary hit points equal to her druid level. She can apply the young template to any bat to reduce the level of the summoning spell required by one. She can also increase the level of summoning required by one in order to apply either the advanced or the giant template, or increase it by two to apply both the advanced and giant templates.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 6th level, a bat shaman&#146;s wild shape ability functions at her druid level &#150;2. If she takes on the form of a bat, she instead uses her druid level + 2.</p>
			<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Venom Immunity (Ex) </b>: At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat: </b>At 9th level and every four levels thereafter, a bat shaman gains one of the following bonus feats: Acrobatic, Agile Maneuvers, Improved Initiative, Lightning Reflexes, or Skill Focus (Perception). She must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
					<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
					<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as beast shape II . When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as elemental body I.</p>
					<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as beast shape III . When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as elemental body II. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as plant shape I .</p>
					<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as elemental body III . When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as plant shape II .</p>
					<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as elemental body IV . When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as plant shape III .</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>An arctic druid watches over the stark landscape of the far frozen reaches of the world, tending the stunted and rugged life that ekes out its survival in the least habitable climes.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Arctic Native (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, an arctic druid gains a bonus on Initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks equal to 1/2 her druid level in cold or icy terrain, and she cannot be tracked in cold or icy terrain.</p>
			<p><b>Icewalking (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, an arctic druid suffers no penalty to speed or on Acrobatics, Climb, or Stealth checks in snowy or icy terrain or weather conditions and can walk across snow crusts or thin ice without breaking through.</p>
			<p><b>Arctic Endurance (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an arctic druid ignores the effects of a cold climate as if using endure elements. She is also immune to being dazzled.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: An arctic druid gains this ability at 6th level, except that her effective druid level for this ability is equal to her druid level &#150; 2.</p>
			<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>.

				<name type="string">Nature bond</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
					<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
					<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>

The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>

The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>-</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: An aquatic druid&#146;s wild empathy functions only on creatures that have a swim speed or the aquatic or water subtype; however, she can improve the attitude of any such creature with Intelligence 2 or less regardless of type, including mindless creatures.</p>
			<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Aquatic Adaptation (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, an aquatic druid gains an insight bonus on Initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, Survival, and Swim checks equal to 1/2 her druid level in aquatic terrain, and she cannot be tracked such environments.</p>
			<p><b>Natural Swimmer (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, an aquatic druid gains a swim speed equal to half her land speed.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Ocean&#146;s Fury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an aquatic druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against spells of the water type1 or the exceptional or supernatural abilities of creatures with the aquatic or water subtype.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: An aquatic druid gains this ability at 6th level, except that her effective druid level for the ability is equal to her druid level &#150; 2.</p>
			<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Seaborn (Ex): </b>At 9th level, an aquatic druid gains the aquatic subtype, the amphibious trait, and a swim speed equal to her land speed. She also can endure cold climate effects as if using endure elements.</p>
			<p><b>Deep Diver (Ex): </b>At 13th level, an aquatic druid gains DR/slashing or piercing equal to 1/2 her level. This damage reduction also applies against spells and spell-like abilities that inflict damage by grappling or crushing (e.g., black tentacles, crushing hand). She never takes pressure damage from deep water.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

					<p>A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>

					<p>An ape shaman can use wild empathy with apes and other primates as a full-round action with a +4 bonus.</p>
					<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A shaman with this totem calls upon the mighty ape, a peaceful but powerful simian whose strength is beyond compare. An ape shaman is a friendly protector of the forest, but will crush those enemies who rouse her anger.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: An ape shaman who chooses an animal companion must select an ape or related primate. If choosing a domain, the ape shaman must choose from the Animal, Community (Family subdomain), Destruction (Rage subdomain), and Strength domains.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: An ape shaman can use wild empathy with apes and other primates as a full-round action with a +4 bonus.</p>
			<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Totem Transformation (Su): </b>At 2nd level, an ape shaman may adopt an aspect of the ape while retaining her normal form. She gains one of the following bonuses:</p>
			<list>
				<li>movement (climb speed 20 ft., +4 racial bonus on Climb checks)</li>
				<li>senses (low-light vision, scent)</li>
				<li>natural weapons (2 slams [1d6 for a Medium shaman], +2 on combat maneuver checks to grapple)</li>
				<li>toughness (+2 natural armor bonus to AC, Endurance feat)</li>
			</list>
			<p>While using totem transformation, the ape shaman may speak normally and can cast speak with animals (primates only) at will. Using this ability is a standard action at 2nd level, a move action at 7th level, and a swift action at 12th level. The ape shaman can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her druid level. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but they must be used in 1-minute increments. This is a polymorph effect and cannot be used while the druid is using another polymorph effect, such as wild shape.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex) </b>: Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that utilize or target plants, such as <i>blight </i>, <i>entangle </i>, <i>spike growth </i>, and <i>warp wood </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Totemic Summons (Su): </b>At 5th level, an ape shaman may cast summon nature&#146;s ally as a standard action when summoning primates, and these summoned creatures gain temporary hit points equal to her druid level. She can apply the young template to any primate to reduce the level of the summoning spell required by one. She can also increase the level of summoning required by one in order to apply either the advanced or the giant template, or increase it by two to apply both the advanced and giant templates.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 6th level, an ape shaman&#146;s wild shape ability functions at her druid level &#150;2. If she takes on the form of an ape, she instead uses her druid level +2.</p>
			<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat: </b>At 9th level and every four levels thereafter, an ape shaman gains one of the following bonus feats: Diehard, Endurance, Great Fortitude, Improved Bull Rush, and Toughness. She must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

					<p>At 13th level, an ancient guardian gains the ability to reduce a nonliving item to its component raw materials. This acts as the spell polymorph any object, but works on magical or non-magical nonliving objects. The duration is always permanent. Unlike polymorph any object, this ability can&#146;t be used to mimic the effects of other spells. Items subject to this effect receive a Fortitude saving throw to negate the effect (DC = 10 + 1/2 the ancient guardian&#146;s druid level + her Wisdom modifier). Magic items receive a circumstance bonus on this save equal to +1 for every 5,000 gp of the item&#146;s value.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Ancient guardians revere nature and draw power from its divine energies, but also protect the customs, histories, and lore of their tribe and race. They act as ambassadors and protectors of the old ways, nurturing their tribe&#146;s growth and holding back civilization&#146;s corruptive influence.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Ancient Arms: </b>An ancient guardian can&#146;t wield weapons made primarily of metal. She is proficient with only the club, dart, quarterstaff, shortspear, sling, and spear. She is also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form she assumes with wild shape. Using a prohibited weapon renders her unable to cast druid spells or use any of her druid supernatural or spell-like class abilities while wielding the weapon and for 24 hours after ceasing to wield it. This alters the druid&#146;s normal weapon proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Dispel Hostility (Su): </b>An ancient guardian doesn&#146;t gain spontaneous casting at 1st level. Instead, at 3rd level, she can channel stored spell energy into a spell capable of dispelling hostile thoughts and strong emotions. She can &#147;lose&#148; a prepared spell in order to cast calm emotions.</p>
			<p>Instead of the normal Will saving throw for that spell, the DC of a calm emotions spell cast with this ability is 10 + 1/2 the ancient guardian&#146;s druid level + her Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Community Bond (Ex): </b>At 1st level, an ancient guardian must choose the domain nature bond ability and select from the following domains: Community, Healing, Knowledge, Protection, or Repose.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Patience of Nature (Ex): </b>An ancient guardian does not gain wild empathy at 1st level. Instead, at 2nd level, an ancient guardian adds Diplomacy, Perform (oratory), and Sense Motive to her list of class skills and gains an insight bonus equal to half her druid level on such checks.</p>
			<p><b>Ancient Ways (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, an ancient guardian increases any climb, fly, or swim speeds she has or gains via her wild shape ability by 10 feet.</p>
			<p><b>Unimpeachable (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an ancient guardian gains a +4 bonus on saves against enchantments.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>Venom Immunity (Ex) </b>: At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>
			<p><b>Undo Artifice (Sp): </b>At 13th level, an ancient guardian gains the ability to reduce a nonliving item to its component raw materials. This acts as the spell polymorph any object, but works on magical or non-magical nonliving objects. The duration is always permanent. Unlike polymorph any object, this ability can&#146;t be used to mimic the effects of other spells. Items subject to this effect receive a Fortitude saving throw to negate the effect (DC = 10 + 1/2 the ancient guardian&#146;s druid level + her Wisdom modifier). Magic items receive a circumstance bonus on this save equal to +1 for every 5,000 gp of the item&#146;s value.</p>
			<p>An ancient guardian can use undo artifice a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

					<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The aerie protector guards nature&#146;s nests and lairs in the highest mountains, and she is only ever truly at ease when under vast expanses of open sky.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral.</p>
			<h>Ex-Druids</h>
			<p>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, javelins, quarterstaff, shortbows, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>
			<p>Druids are proficient with light armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Druid Table. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).</p>
			<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Casting </b>: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can &#34;lose&#34; a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell of the same level or lower.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells </b>: A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons </b>: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Druid Table under &#34;Spells per Day.&#34; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages </b>: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>
			<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Bond (Ex) </b>: If the aerie protector chooses an animal companion as her nature bond, she must choose an animal with a fly speed. She can use spells or other effects to alter her companion&#146;s fly speed, but it must be able to fly on its own before it becomes her companion.</p>
			<p>If the aerie protector chooses a domain as her nature bond, she must choose the Air, Eagle, Earth, Mountain, or Weather domain.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>
			<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in the reference manual under Druid Companions. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>
			<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Sense (Ex) </b>: A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex) </b>: An aerie protector gains a +4 bonus on wild empathy checks on flying animals, but she takes a &#150;4 penalty on checks on other animals.</p>
			<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Sky and Stone (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, an aerie protector gains a bonus equal to half her level on Knowledge (geography) and Survival checks involving mountainous terrain or high altitudes, and she cannot be tracked in such an environment.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
			<p><b>Wind at Her Back (Su): </b>At 4th level, an aerie protector gains a +4 bonus to CMD and on saving throws against the effects of high altitude and effects that rely on air pressure or strong wind to move her or impede her flight. This bonus also applies to Reflex saves against effects that deal electricity damage.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su) </b>: An aerie protector gains this ability at 6th level, except her effective druid level is her druid level &#150; 2. If she takes on the form of a flying animal, she instead uses her druid level + 2.</p>
			<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>beast shape I </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.</p>
			<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>
			<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape II </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>elemental body I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as <i>beast shape III </i>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body II </i>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as <i>plant shape I </i>.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body III </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape II </i>.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>elemental body IV </i>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as <i>plant shape III </i>.</p>
			<p><b>In the Wind (Ex): </b>At 9th level, the climb and fly speeds of forms the aerie protector assumes with her wild shape ability (if any) increase by 10 feet. The maneuverability of her flying forms improves by one category.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su) </b>: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>
