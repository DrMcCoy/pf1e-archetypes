					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>-</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>8 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>A rogue adds 1/2 her level on Perception checks to locate traps and on Disable Device checks (minimum +1). A rogue can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Danger Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a rogue gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability counts as trap sense for the purpose of any feat or class prerequisite, and can be replaced by any archetype class feature that replaces trap sense. The bonuses gained from this ability stack with those gained from trap sense (from another class).</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A clever rogue knows the easiest battle to win is the one that&#146;s over before your foe knows it has begun. Some rogues thus specialize in setting up ambushes to catch their opponents off guard.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Staggering Reflexes (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a waylayer gains a bonus on initiative checks equal to 1/2 her level (minimum +1) if she acts in a surprise round, and is never flat-footed at the start of combat (even if she fails to act during the surprise round). This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Danger Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a rogue gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability counts as trap sense for the purpose of any feat or class prerequisite, and can be replaced by any archetype class feature that replaces trap sense. The bonuses gained from this ability stack with those gained from trap sense (from another class).</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Ambuscading Sneak Attack (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a waylayer becomes especially skilled at attacking unaware foes. When she makes a sneak attack during a surprise round, she uses d8s to roll sneak attack damage instead of d6s. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Danger Awareness (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a waylayer is never considered an unaware combatant and is always able to act in the surprise round. This replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Exceptional Reflexes (Ex): </b>At 12th level, a waylayer can move up to her speed before taking her action in a surprise round. This replaces the rogue talent gained at 12th level.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Reflexes (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a waylayer&#146;s initiative roll is automatically a natural 20. This ability replaces the rogue talent gained at 20th level.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Vexing dodgers take advantage of their smaller size to outmaneuver larger foes such as giants. Vexing dodgers have the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>8 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Limb-Climber (Ex): </b>When adjacent to or in the space of a corporeal creature at least one size category larger than herself, a vexing dodger can climb that creature&#146;s body with a successful Climb check against a DC equal to the target creature&#146;s CMD. Although the vexing dodger is holding on to the creature, this action isn&#146;t a grapple; it doesn&#146;t provoke attacks of opportunity from the creature, and neither the vexing dodger nor the creature she climbs gains the grappled condition. While the vexing dodger is on the climbed creature, the creature takes a penalty on attack rolls against the vexing dodger equal to the number of sneak attack dice the dodger possesses. This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Dirty Trick (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a vexing dodger gains Improved Dirty TrickAPG as a bonus feat, even if she doesn&#146;t meet the prerequisites. This ability replaces the rogue talent gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Underfoot Agility (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a vexing dodger gains a +1 morale bonus on Acrobatics, Climb, and Escape Artist attempts against creatures at least one size category larger than herself. This bonus increases by 1 for every 3 levels beyond 3rd. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 4th level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Underfoot Trickster (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a vexing dodger can move through the space of a creature two size categories larger than herself without needing to attempt an Acrobatics check. She would still need to succeed at Acrobatics checks to avoid attacks of opportunity provoked by leaving a threatened space; this ability covers only the ability to move. Additionally, whenever the vexing dodger hits a larger foe with a melee sneak attack, she can choose to forgo the sneak attack bonus damage and instead attempt make a dirty trick combat maneuver as a swift action. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Distracting Climber (Ex): </b>At 8th level, when a vexing dodger attempts a dirty trick maneuver against a creature she&#146;s climbing, she gets a bonus on the combat maneuver check equal to the number of sneak attack dice she has. If she chooses to sicken the target with her dirty trick and succeeds at her combat maneuver check, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vexing dodger&#146;s level + her Intelligence modifier) or be nauseated for 1 round. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Underground chemists are part of the rotting, fetid underbelly of the alchemical world. While underground chemists can&#146;t hold a candle to dedicated alchemists, they&#146;re tricky and dangerous with alchemical substances and potions.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>A rogue adds 1/2 her level on Perception checks to locate traps and on Disable Device checks (minimum +1). A rogue can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Chemical Weapons (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, an underground chemist is able to retrieve an alchemical item as if drawing a weapon. She adds her Intelligence modifier to damage dealt with splash weapons, including any splash damage. She adds 1/2 her level to Craft (alchemy) checks. This ability replaces evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Danger Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a rogue gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability counts as trap sense for the purpose of any feat or class prerequisite, and can be replaced by any archetype class feature that replaces trap sense. The bonuses gained from this ability stack with those gained from trap sense (from another class).</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Precise Splash Weapons (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an underground chemist can deal sneak attack damage with splash weapons. The attack must be her first attack that round, qualify for dealing sneak attack damage (such as against a flat-footed target), and be directed at a creature rather than a square. This ability replaces the rogue talent gained at 4th level.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Discovery (Su): </b>At 10th level, an underground chemist can select one of the following alchemist discoveries (Advanced Player&#146;s Guide 28) in place of a rogue talent: concentrate poison, dilution, enhance potion, extend potion, mummificationUM, nauseating fleshUC, poison conversionUC, preserve organsUM, spontaneous healingUM, or sticky poison. She uses her rogue level as her alchemist level for determining the effects of her discoveries and whether she is able to select one. This ability alters advanced talents.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some rogues are not content with just disabling traps&#151;they love to build them, finding a captivating beauty in the turning of gears and the slither of ropes over pulleys. The trapsmith may have started out putting together traps in order to better understand how to disable them, but for most, it&#146;s long since gone beyond that&#151;they now relish the challenge of creating the perfect combat machine.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>8 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>A rogue adds 1/2 her level on Perception checks to locate traps and on Disable Device checks (minimum +1). A rogue can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Careful Disarm (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a trapsmith attempts to disarm a trap using Disable Device, she does not spring the trap unless she fails by 10 or more. If she does set off a trap she was attempting to disarm, she adds double her trap sense bonus to avoid the trap. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Trap Master (Ex): </b>At 8th level, whenever a trapsmith disarms a trap using Disable Device, she can bypass it even if her check did not exceed the DC by 10 or more. If it is a magic trap that allows specific creatures to pass it without danger, she can modify which creatures it allows to pass, adding her allies and restricting enemies if she desires. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Twilight Talons might pursue many tasks, from relatively passive information gathering to staging massive coups meant to depose tyrants. A toxic talon, however, is trained and deployed for one very specific purpose: to defeat foes with unusual and potent poisons. After adopting a profession to serve as a cover for his activities, a toxic talon spends resources and time combining easy-to-obtain materials into dangerous toxins to aid in the defense of Andoran. A toxic talon can use rare, complex, slow-release poisons to make a death look like it happened naturally, but sometimes the toxic talon will use specific poisons to cast suspicion on other organizations, stirring internal conflict that other Twilight Talons can use to their advantage.</i></p>
			<p><i>The use of poisons in the defense of a good nation is controversial, and other branches of the Eagle Knights generally disavow the existence of toxic talons among their organization. Many influential leaders among the Eagle Knights, particularly in the Steel Falcons, have pushed to have the practices of the toxic talons banned from use, but these efforts have only pushed the toxic talons into further obscurity. Their role is particularly protected by the Twilight Talons, who sometimes go as far as to outright lie to others in the Eagle Knights about the operations of a toxic talon. At other times, a toxic talon may choose to martyr his freedom by publicly accepting blame for a mission that has had unfortunate public repercussions. In such a case, the toxic talon is not abandoned by his kin&#151;instead, he is placed on a fair and public trial whose purpose is as much to appease the masses as it is to determine whether any moral lines were crossed. In cases where such a toxic talon is found guilty, he is generally sentenced to hard labor or prison (in which case he often continues to run missions inside of prisons or other fortifications for the Eagle Knights as best suits his talents) or to exile (in which case his role in serving Andoran shifts to one of clandestine missions in other nations). A toxic talon who martyrs his freedom in this way and is then captured again understands that it&#146;s unlikely he&#146;ll be afforded the same level of support from the Eagle Knights, and that the organization may well disavow any official knowledge of his actions. To a toxic talon, this is all merely a deeper, more significant level of service to the well-being of the nation of Andoran. By serving as a sort of sineater for the rest of the Twilight Talons (and at times, for the other branches of the Eagle Knights), such selfless characters can ensure that the organization survives scandal and public outcry to carry on their good work. In such cases, while public recognition for their deeds may never manifest, their brothers and sisters never forget the toxic talon&#146;s sacrifice.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus blowguns, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields. He can use a blowgun without penalty while prone.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>A rogue adds 1/2 her level on Perception checks to locate traps and on Disable Device checks (minimum +1). A rogue can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Toxin Resistance (Ex): </b>A toxic talon&#146;s constant exposure to varied poisons grants him increasing resistance to them. At 3rd level, a toxic talon gains a +1 bonus on saving throws against diseases and poisons, and he gains a +1 bonus on Heal checks to treat diseases and poisons. He also gains a +1 bonus on caster level checks (including when he activates a magic item) to treat or remove poisons and diseases, such as when using remove disease or neutralize poison. Finally, he gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to identify traps that utilize diseases or poisons. These bonuses increase to +2 at 6th level, to +3 at 9th level, to +4 at 12th level, to +5 at 15th level, and to +6 at 18th level.</p>
			<p>This replaces trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Catalyst (Su): </b>At 4th level, a toxic talon can use secret alchemical techniques to enhance a poison as he applies it to a weapon, increasing the save DC of the poison by 1 (this bonus increases to +2 at 12th level). This increase to the save DC lasts for 1 minute or until the poison is used up, whichever comes first. A toxic talon can use catalyst once per hour.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Split Toxin (Su): </b>At 8th level, when a toxic talon uses catalyst to enhance poison as he applies it, he can envenom two ranged weapons or units of ammunition simultaneously with the same dose.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the rogue&#146;s improved uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

					<p>At 8th level, while making a full attack underwater, a tidal trickster can give up one attack to create a tidal distortion. When she creates a tidal distortion, the tidal trickster moves up to 10 feet. If any part of her movement includes a square adjacent to one or more foes, she can choose one of those foes and attempt a Bluff check with a DC of 11 + either the enemy&#146;s Sense Motive or Swim modifier, whichever is higher. Her Bluff check is subject to any penalties the attack roll she sacrificed would have taken, and if she trades an iterative attack gained from having a high base attack bonus, she also takes a penalty based on that attack&#146;s lower base attack bonus (a &#150;5 penalty for the second iterative attack, a &#150;10 penalty for the third iterative attack, and a &#150;15 penalty for the fourth iterative attack, if she manages to gain one). If she succeeds at the Bluff check, the movement doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity from that foe and the foe becomes off-balance (see page 45) until its next turn.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Tidal tricksters roam the seas, using their skillful mastery of the currents to move across aquatic battlefields and throw their enemies off-balance.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Wisdom of the Waves (Ex): </b>A tidal trickster gains a swim speed equal to her unmodified base land speed (or increases her swim speed by 10 feet, if she has a racial swim speed). Instead of the +8 bonus granted by a swim speed, she gains a racial bonus on Swim checks equal to 4 + half her rogue level (if she has a racial swim speed, she uses the better bonus). She gains a bonus on Bluff checks equal to half her rogue level. At 3rd level, she gains a +1 bonus on Will saves whenever she is underwater; this bonus increases by 1 at 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces trapfinding and trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Liquid Disruption (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a tidal trickster can use her knowledge of the cohesion of liquids to disrupt certain foes. She can deal sneak attack damage to oozes and creatures with the water subtype that are normally immune to precision damage (such as water elementals), and she ignores a hydrokineticist&#146;s chance to negate precision damage from elemental overflow.</p>
			<p>This ability alters sneak attack and replaces uncanny dodge and the 4th-level rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Tidal Distortion (Ex): </b>At 8th level, while making a full attack underwater, a tidal trickster can give up one attack to create a tidal distortion. When she creates a tidal distortion, the tidal trickster moves up to 10 feet. If any part of her movement includes a square adjacent to one or more foes, she can choose one of those foes and attempt a Bluff check with a DC of 11 + either the enemy&#146;s Sense Motive or Swim modifier, whichever is higher. Her Bluff check is subject to any penalties the attack roll she sacrificed would have taken, and if she trades an iterative attack gained from having a high base attack bonus, she also takes a penalty based on that attack&#146;s lower base attack bonus (a &#150;5 penalty for the second iterative attack, a &#150;10 penalty for the third iterative attack, and a &#150;15 penalty for the fourth iterative attack, if she manages to gain one). If she succeeds at the Bluff check, the movement doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity from that foe and the foe becomes off-balance (see page 45) until its next turn. A tidal trickster can give up any number of her attacks in a given full attack to create tidal distortions, but she can&#146;t give up two consecutive attacks.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge and the 8th-level rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue.

					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some criminals steal with finesse, their victims only discovering the crime when the rogue is long gone and the coin already spent. A thug, on the other hand, cares nothing for finesse. Through both threat and violence, the thug gets what she wants by the promise of force, and has no problem making good on that promise as needed.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Frightening (Ex): </b>Whenever a thug successfully uses Intimidate to demoralize a creature, the duration of the shaken condition is increased by 1 round. In addition, if the target is shaken for 4 or more rounds, the thug can instead decide to make the target frightened for 1 round. This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Brutal Beating (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, whenever a thug deals sneak attack damage, she can choose to forgo 1d6 points of sneak attack damage to make the target sickened for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 her rogue level. This ability does not stack with itself&#151;only the most recent duration applies. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Sylvan tricksters are rogues who model themselves after the mischievous fey of legend. Though not spellcasters, sylvan tricksters learn minor magical abilities reminiscent of those favored by fey creatures. The journey for many sylvan tricksters began in childhood, learning at an elder&#146;s knee the stories of the fey and the secrets of how to resist their tricks. Sylvan tricksters often live in areas where the boundary with the First World is thin, and a few have even been there&#151; voluntarily or not.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Language: </b>Sylvan is gained as a bonus language</p>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A sylvan trickster can improve an animal&#146;s attitude. This ability functions as the druid ability of the same name, using the sylvan trickster&#146;s rogue level as her effective druid level.</p>
			<p>This replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Fey Tricks: </b>A sylvan trickster can select a witch hex in place of a rogue talent. At 10th level, the sylvan trickster can select a hex or major hex in place of a rogue talent. At 18th level, a sylvan trickster can select a hex, major hex, or grand hex in place of a rogue talent. She cannot select any hex more than once.</p>
			<p>This alters rogue talents.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Danger Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a rogue gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability counts as trap sense for the purpose of any feat or class prerequisite, and can be replaced by any archetype class feature that replaces trap sense. The bonuses gained from this ability stack with those gained from trap sense (from another class).</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Nature&#146;s Lure (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a sylvan trickster gains resist nature&#146;s lure as the druid ability of the same name.</p>
			<p>This replaces uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Fey Resistance (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a sylvan trickster gains DR 2/cold iron. At 11th level and every 3 levels thereafter, this damage reduction increases by 2 (to a maximum of DR 10/cold iron at 20th level).</p>
			<p>This replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level, a swordmaster learns to focus her martial prowess using an intense meditative trance. Under the influence of a trance, the swordmaster can perform fantastic martial feats. Entering a trance is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The swordmaster can maintain the trance for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Wisdom modifier. At each level beyond 3rd, she can remain in the trance for 1 additional round. She can end her trance as a free action. Following a trance, the swordmaster is fatigued for a number of rounds equal to 2 &#215; the number of rounds she spent in the trance. A swordmaster cannot enter a new trance while fatigued but can otherwise enter a trance multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a swordmaster falls unconscious, her trance immediately ends.</p>
					<p>At 3rd level, the swordmaster chooses one trance from the list below. She chooses another trance at 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level. She can only use one type of trance at a time.</p>
					<p><i>Crane Trance (Ex): </i>The swordmaster&#146;s blade rises and falls with the graceful sweeping arcs of the mountain crane. When in this trance, a swordmaster gains the benefits of the Crane Style feat .</p>
					<p><i>Dragon Trance (Ex): </i>Like the dragon, the swordmaster has honed the steadiness of her mind and body. When in this trance, a swordmaster gains the benefits of the Dragon Style feat .</p>
					<p><i>Leopard Trance (Ex): </i>Using the swiftness of the leopard, a swordmaster&#146;s evasive footwork confuses her opponents. When in this trance, a swordmaster gains the benefits of the Mobility feat.</p>
					<p><i>Monkey Trance (Ex): </i>As the monkey springs, the swordmaster leaps from the reach of her enemies. While in this trance, a swordmaster can make an Acrobatics check opposed by an opponent&#146;s CMD. If she succeeds, she may move 5 feet as a swift action within the opponent&#146;s threatened area; this movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity and does not count as a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p><i>Serpent Trance (Ex): </i>Like the serpent, the swordmaster&#146;s quick movements allow her to catch her opponent unawares. While in this trance, a swordmaster receives a +4 bonus on Bluff checks made to feint during combat.</p>
					<p><i>Tiger Trance (Ex): </i>The swordmaster pounces upon her opponents, striking with the ferocity and brute force of a wild tiger. While in this trance, a swordmaster can make a combat maneuver check against an opponent within charge range. If she succeeds, she may charge that opponent and make a full attack against that opponent.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A swordmaster meditates to strengthen her spiritual connection to her blade. She strives to perfect her skills by mastering six deadly trances. A swordmaster has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Race: </b>Tengu Only</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>8 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>A rogue adds 1/2 her level on Perception checks to locate traps and on Disable Device checks (minimum +1). A rogue can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Trance (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a swordmaster learns to focus her martial prowess using an intense meditative trance. Under the influence of a trance, the swordmaster can perform fantastic martial feats. Entering a trance is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The swordmaster can maintain the trance for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Wisdom modifier. At each level beyond 3rd, she can remain in the trance for 1 additional round. She can end her trance as a free action. Following a trance, the swordmaster is fatigued for a number of rounds equal to 2 &#215; the number of rounds she spent in the trance. A swordmaster cannot enter a new trance while fatigued but can otherwise enter a trance multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a swordmaster falls unconscious, her trance immediately ends.</p>
			<p>At 3rd level, the swordmaster chooses one trance from the list below. She chooses another trance at 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level. She can only use one type of trance at a time.</p>
			<p><i>Crane Trance (Ex): </i>The swordmaster&#146;s blade rises and falls with the graceful sweeping arcs of the mountain crane. When in this trance, a swordmaster gains the benefits of the Crane Style feat .</p>
			<p><i>Dragon Trance (Ex): </i>Like the dragon, the swordmaster has honed the steadiness of her mind and body. When in this trance, a swordmaster gains the benefits of the Dragon Style feat .</p>
			<p><i>Leopard Trance (Ex): </i>Using the swiftness of the leopard, a swordmaster&#146;s evasive footwork confuses her opponents. When in this trance, a swordmaster gains the benefits of the Mobility feat.</p>
			<p><i>Monkey Trance (Ex): </i>As the monkey springs, the swordmaster leaps from the reach of her enemies. While in this trance, a swordmaster can make an Acrobatics check opposed by an opponent&#146;s CMD. If she succeeds, she may move 5 feet as a swift action within the opponent&#146;s threatened area; this movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity and does not count as a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p><i>Serpent Trance (Ex): </i>Like the serpent, the swordmaster&#146;s quick movements allow her to catch her opponent unawares. While in this trance, a swordmaster receives a +4 bonus on Bluff checks made to feint during combat.</p>
			<p><i>Tiger Trance (Ex): </i>The swordmaster pounces upon her opponents, striking with the ferocity and brute force of a wild tiger. While in this trance, a swordmaster can make a combat maneuver check against an opponent within charge range. If she succeeds, she may charge that opponent and make a full attack against that opponent.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces all increments of trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
					<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
					<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage.

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A paragon of mobile swordplay, the swashbuckler is a rogue who focuses almost exclusively on honing her skill at arms and perfecting daring acrobatic moves and elaborate flourishes that border on performance.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Martial Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, the swashbuckler may select one martial weapon to add to her list of weapon proficiencies. In addition, she may take the combat trick rogue talent up to two times. This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Daring (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a swashbuckler gains a +1 morale bonus on Acrobatics checks and saving throws against fear. This bonus increases by +1 for every 3 levels beyond 3rd. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue.

A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Swamp poisoners use their own toxins to defend their homes and level the playing field. The swamp poisoner is an archetype available to grippli characters, and it is appropriate for rogues built using the rules from the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook as well as for unchained rogues.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Prerequisites: </b>A swamp poisoner must have selected the toxic skin grippli alternate racial trait.</p>
			<p><b>Race: </b>Grippli</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Mucous Membrane (Ex): </b>A swamp poisoner gains a bonus equal to half his class level on Escape Artist checks and to his CMD when resisting grapple attempts (minimum 1).</p>
			<p>This replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Mark the Vein (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, when the swamp poisoner attacks a target that is currently affected by his grippli racial poison, that target is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC. The target must be actively poisoned, not just suffering the effects of poison, such as lingering ability damage.</p>
			<p>This replaces the rogue talent gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Poison the Well (Ex): </b>At 3rd level as a standard action, a swamp poisoner can smear the poison generated through the use of his toxic skin alternate racial trait onto the ground in a 5-foot area, instead of onto a weapon or his own body. The first creature other than the swamp poisoner to enter the area is exposed to the poison. The poison loses its potency after 1 hour. This area is considered a trap, and the DCs of Perception checks to notice it and Disable Device checks to disable it are equal to 10 + half the swamp poisoner&#146;s level + the swamp poisoner&#146;s Constitution modifier.</p>
			<p>The swamp poisoner also gains an extra use per day of his toxic skin alternate racial trait, plus one additional use per day for every 3 levels beyond 3rd.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 4th level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The survivalist focuses her talents on surviving harsh and unforgiving conditions that would kill a lesser rogue. Whether in blazing deserts or frigid arctic wastes&#151;or simply the cold, hard reality of the streets&#151;the survivalist uses her training to both ensure her own success and provide for the safety of her allies.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Hardy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a survivalist is already prepared to endure extreme hardships and environmental conditions. She can go twice the normal number of days without water and triple the normal number of days without food before feeling the effects of either thirst or starvation. This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Endure Elements (Sp): </b>At 3rd level, a survivalist rogue can use endure elements once per day as a spell-like ability. The survivalist&#146;s caster level is the same as her rogue level. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The best spies are like chameleons, but not only can they change their appearances to fit the situation, they can also change their personalities, allegiances, and even loves if that&#146;s what it takes to achieve their clandestine goals. Spies are the ultimate manipulators, and even those who commission their services sometimes find that they&#146;ve merely served the spies&#146; own interests.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Skilled Liar (Ex): </b>Whenever a spy uses Bluff to attempt to deceive someone, she gains a bonus on the opposed roll equal to 1/2 her rogue level (minimum +1). This bonus does not apply to feint attempts or attempts to pass secret messages. This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Use (Ex): </b>A 3rd level, a spy is trained in the use of poison and cannot accidentally poison herself when applying poison to a blade. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Snoops are the underworld&#146;s version of detectives. They often act as information peddlers, specializing in gathering secrets through investigation, subterfuge, and coercion, and selling or trading those secrets for personal gain.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a snoop gains an ability similar to the investigator&#146;s inspiration class ability (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide 31). The snoop begins with an inspiration pool equal to half her rogue level plus her Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). Unlike an investigator, a snoop can only use inspiration on skill checks, not on attack rolls or saving throws. This ability is otherwise identical to the investigator class ability of the same name.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces trapfinding and evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talents (Ex): </b>Beginning at 2nd level, and each time she selects a new rogue talent, a snoop can instead select one of the following investigator talents (Advanced Class Guide 32&#150;33) eidetic recollection, empathy, hidden agendas, inspired alertness, inspired intimidator, item lore, or underworld inspiration. Her effective investigator level for the purpose of these talents is equal to her rogue level. She still can&#146;t use inspiration on attack rolls or saving throws (so, for instance, she can&#146;t use the second part of hidden agendas).</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Danger Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a rogue gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability counts as trap sense for the purpose of any feat or class prerequisite, and can be replaced by any archetype class feature that replaces trap sense. The bonuses gained from this ability stack with those gained from trap sense (from another class).</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Snoop (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a snoop gains a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks when trying to force an opponent to give her information (or Bluff and Diplomacy checks for the same purpose if she has the coax informationAPG rogue talent). She also gains a +2 bonus on Sense Motive checks to tell if someone&#146;s information is false. At 8th level, these bonuses increase to +4.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Master of Whispers (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a snoop receives the rumormongerUC advanced rogue talent.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the rogue talent gained at 8th level.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some say that the sniper is the worst kind of assassin: a killer who waits silently in the shadows and then strikes from a distance without remorse. Snipers, of course, understand that such protestations about &#147;cowardice&#148; and &#147;honor&#148; regarding their profession are in fact merely the bleatings of sheep fearing the slaughter and pay them no heed. Most snipers take pride in their formidable abilities, which allow them to take life quickly, quietly, and efficiently, then disappear into their surroundings without a trace.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Accuracy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a sniper halves all range increment penalties when making ranged attacks with a bow or crossbow. This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Deadly Range (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a sniper increases the range at which she can apply her sneak attack damage by 10 feet. This range increases by 10 feet for every 3 levels after 3rd. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Deep in darkness, the snare setter constructs his deadly traps and brutal mechanisms to confound and destroy any who try to invade his domain.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Race: </b>Kobold Only</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Trapper (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a snare setter gains Learn Ranger Trap (see page 24) as a bonus feat. In addition to the trap granted by this feat, he learns how to construct the tripwire trap for free. For the purposes of this feat, he&#146;s considered a ranger of his snare setter level, and uses his Intelligence in place of Wisdom to determine uses per day and the DC of his ranger traps. Whenever the snare setter could learn a new rogue trick, he may instead learn a new ranger trap.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces sneak attack (but see below).</p>
			<p><b>Trapsmithing (Ex): </b>A snare setter gains a bonus on Perception skill checks to detect traps and on Craft (traps) checks equal to 1/2 his snare setter level. He can use Craft (traps) in place of Disable Device to disarm traps, including magical traps.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Danger Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a rogue gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability counts as trap sense for the purpose of any feat or class prerequisite, and can be replaced by any archetype class feature that replaces trap sense. The bonuses gained from this ability stack with those gained from trap sense (from another class).</p>
			<p><b>Deadly Traps (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, the snare setter&#146;s traps deal an additional 1d6 points of damage on the first round they&#146;re activated. This damage is of the same type the trap normally deals. Traps that don&#146;t deal damage are unaffected by this ability. This additional damage increases by 1d6 points every 4 levels beyond 3rd (7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th).</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack (Su): </b>At 5th level, the snare setter gains sneak attack +1d6. This functions as the rogue ability of the same name, but the damage increases by 1d6 every 4 levels after 5th (9th, 13th, and 17th).</p>
			<p>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Snare Setter (Ex): </b>At 20th level, the snare setter can attach one of a rogue&#146;s master strike effects to a trap he creates. When the trap is triggered, the subject makes an additional Fortitude save at the same DC as the trap to avoid this effect. A snare setter can have only one trap affected by this ability active at any time. He may remove this ability from a trap at any range as a free action.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces master strike.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Smugglers specialize in moving contraband from one area to another while avoiding detection by authorities. Sometimes a smuggler&#146;s cargo is illegal goods, such as drugs or slaves. Other times, a smuggler hides legal goods to avoid paying duties or taxes, and some may even use their abilities to help smuggle escaped slaves to freedom. Smugglers may work on a ship that does nothing but smuggle goods from one port to another, or they may freelance, working on ships that require a smuggler&#146;s services for a short time.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Conceal Item: </b>A smuggler adds 1/2 her level on Sleight of Hand checks (minimum +1). A smuggler can use Sleight of Hand to conceal a small item in a container or room, such as the false bottom of a chest or beneath floorboards. Anyone attempting to find an item concealed by a smuggler makes a Perception check opposed by the Sleight of Hand check made by the smuggler when she concealed the object. This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Distraction: </b>A smuggler uses patter and body language to deflect searchers from hidden items. At 2nd level, a smuggler may make a Bluff check opposed by a searcher&#146;s Perception check when a searcher looks for items the smuggler has concealed. If the smuggler&#146;s Bluff check succeeds, the searcher must make a second Perception check and take the lower of the two rolls. This ability replaces Evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Bribery: </b>An experienced smuggler knows how to smooth over interactions with customs officials. At 3rd level, when dealing with officials working at a checkpoint, conducting an inspection, or performing another such activity, a smuggler can make a Diplomacy check opposed by the presiding official&#146;s Sense Motive check to ensure her contraband makes it through. She gains a +1 bonus on this Diplomacy check. On a successful check, the smuggler pays a small bribe (5d4 gp) to guarantee her cargo remains undisturbed. This bonus rises to +2 when the smuggler reaches 6th level, +3 at 9th level, +4 at 12th level, +5 at 15th level, and +6 at 18th level. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>At 8th level, a sly saboteur can use Disable Device to rig a magic item to fail as if it were an extremely complex device.

If the item&#146;s effect is continuous or has a duration, the effect fails after 1d4 rounds or minutes of use (sly saboteur&#146;s choice).

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Sly saboteurs are irregular soldiers who specialize in sabotage and surprise attacks. Though they often face enemies with greater numbers or resources (or both), sly saboteurs have the advantage of knowing the local people and terrain. They might be rebels fighting against a corrupt government, or they might be members of a militia opposing an invading force. Some are environmentalists who sabotage the tools of industry in order to protect unspoiled nature.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>A rogue adds 1/2 her level on Perception checks to locate traps and on Disable Device checks (minimum +1). A rogue can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Scamper (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a sly saboteur can move through 5 feet of difficult terrain each round as if it were normal terrain. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, this distance increases by 5 feet (to a maximum of 30 feet at 18th level). This ability allows the sly saboteur to take a 5-foot step into difficult terrain. This ability applies only when she is wearing light armor or no armor and carrying no more than a light load, and it stacks with the Acrobatic Steps and Nimble Moves feats.</p>
			<p>This replaces trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Catastrophic Failure (Ex): </b>At 4th level, when a sly saboteur uses Disable Device to rig a device to fail, she can increase the DC of the check by 5. If she does so and succeeds at the check, when the device fails, users take damage equal to the sly saboteur&#146;s sneak attack, or they take half that amount with a successful Reflex save (DC = 10 + half the sly saboteur&#146;s level + her Dexterity modifier). The type of damage depends on the nature of the device but is typically bludgeoning, fire, piercing, or slashing.</p>
			<p>This replaces uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Disable Magic Device (Su): </b>At 8th level, a sly saboteur can use Disable Device to rig a magic item to fail as if it were an extremely complex device. If the item&#146;s effect is instantaneous, the effect is countered the next time the item is activated, but the activation still consumes a charge or use. If the item&#146;s effect is continuous or has a duration, the effect fails after 1d4 rounds or minutes of use (sly saboteur&#146;s choice). This ends the duration or suppresses a continuous effect for 1d4 rounds (as the spell dispel magic). This ability cannot be used on artifacts.</p>
			<p>If this ability is combined with the catastrophic failure ability, the resulting damage is untyped magic and is not reduced by damage reduction or energy resistance.</p>
			<p>This replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Pushed into a life of crime by the society around them, half-orcs gravitate toward criminal activities that suit them best. Half-orc rogues leave subtle tactics and finesse to halflings and elves, and rely on brute strength and thuggery when they go about making mischief. Skulking slayers have turned the use of raw strength and surprise into an art form. A skulking slayer has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Race: </b>Half-Orc Only</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: 6 </b>+ Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>A rogue adds 1/2 her level on Perception checks to locate traps and on Disable Device checks (minimum +1). A rogue can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Bold Strike (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, when a skulking slayer charges and makes a sneak attack with a two-handed weapon, she rolls d8s instead of d6s for her sneak attack damage. This ability replaces trap sense +1 and +4.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Shifty (Ex): </b>At 6th level, a skulking slayer gains a bonus on Bluff checks to feint equal to half her level. This ability replaces trap sense +2.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Unexpected Charge (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a skulking slayer can make a Bluff check to feint as a swift action before a charge. This ability replaces trap sense +3.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Danger Sense (Ex): </b>At 15th level, a rogue gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability counts as trap sense for the purpose of any feat or class prerequisite, and can be replaced by any archetype class feature that replaces trap sense. The bonuses gained from this ability stack with those gained from trap sense (from another class).</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Sharpers use trickery and deception to part an owner from his valuables. Pathological risk-takers, they distinguish themselves from con artists and burglars by virtue of the simplicity and boldness of their schemes, which are usually impromptu, rather than carefully orchestrated. Many sharpers consider themselves romantic figures and foster the image of a resourceful, dashing rogue living by wits and luck while subverting authority at every turn.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>A rogue adds 1/2 her level on Perception checks to locate traps and on Disable Device checks (minimum +1). A rogue can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Sticky Fingers (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a sharper receives Improved StealAPG as a bonus feat. At 6th level, she receives Greater StealAPG as a bonus feat, and at 8th level, she receives Quick StealAPG as a bonus feat. The sharper gains these feats even if she doesn&#146;t meet the prerequisites.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the rogue talents gained at 2nd, 6th, and 8th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Lucky Save (Su): </b>At 3rd level, when a sharper&#146;s wits aren&#146;t enough to pull her out of a bad situation, her luck still just might save her. She gains a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws. This bonus increases to +2 at 9th level and to +3 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Audacious Overconfidence (Ex): </b>At 4th level, after failing an attack roll, skill check, or saving throw, a sharper can reduce her saving throw bonus from lucky save by 1 for 24 hours in order to reroll the failed roll. She can use this ability once per day at 4th level, plus an additional time per day at 10th level and again at 16th level. The decreases to her bonus from lucky save stack with each other.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the rogue talents gained at 4th, 10th, and 16th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p>Rogue Talents: As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 12th level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 12th level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Shadow walkers are comfortable in light, darkness, and the shadows in between. Fetchling rogues naturally gravitate toward becoming shadow walkers, but shadow walkers exist among other creatures both above and below the surface.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Expanded Sight (Su): </b>At 1st level, a shadow walker gains darkvision with a range of 30 feet. If she already has darkvision, the range of her darkvision increases by 10 feet. When the shadow walker reaches 3rd level, and every 2 rogue levels thereafter, the range of her darkvision increases by 10 feet. Also at 3rd level, the shadow walker loses the light sensitivity weakness, if she has it. If she has light blindness, she instead treats it as light sensitivity.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Illumination Control (Sp): </b>At 3rd level, a shadow walker can manipulate nearby illumination. At the start of each day, a shadow walker gains a number of illumination points equal to half her rogue level and can spend illumination points to use certain spell-like abilities. As long as she has at least 1 illumination point, she can cast light at will. She can spend 2 illumination points to cast darkness, and 3 illumination points to cast daylight, deeper darkness, or motes of dusk and dawn (see page 28). These spell-like abilities have a caster level equal to the shadow walker&#146;s rogue level. Using these spell-like abilities does not hamper the shadow walker&#146;s vision; for example, she can see through the deeper darkness she creates, and does not take penalties for light sensitivity in the area of her own daylight.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the rogue talent gained at 2nd level and trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Illumination (Su): </b>At 4th level, a shadow walker chooses one illumination level: bright light, normal light, dim light, or darkness (including supernatural darkness). While she is within her chosen illumination level, she gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Acrobatics, Perception, and Sleight of Hand skill checks, and can take 10 on any Stealth check attempted within that illumination level. When the shadow walker confirms a critical hit with a melee attack that deals sneak attack damage while in her chosen illumination level, she regains 1 illumination point (to a maximum of half her rogue level). Confirming a critical hit on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the shadow walker&#146;s character level doesn&#146;t restore illumination points. When the shadow walker reaches 6th level, and every 3 rogue levels thereafter, the bonuses she gains within her chosen illumination level increase by 1.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the rogue&#146;s uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 4th level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 4th level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Count Ranalc&#146;s worshipers congregate in the places between dark and light, searching for secrets that might one day free their patron from his mysterious exile. Shadow scions have learned some of these secrets and draw power from the shadows themselves. Many shadow scions are dedicated fetchling (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 123) or wayang (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 274) devotees of Count Ranalc.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Shadow Dweller (Ex): </b>A shadow scion gains darkvision with a range of 30 feet and a +1 competence bonus on Stealth checks in dim light and darkness. If she already has darkvision, the range of her darkvision increases by 10 feet. At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the range of her darkvision increases by 10 feet and her bonus on Stealth checks increases by 1.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Shadow Strike: </b>At 2nd level, a shadow scion gains Shadow StrikeAPG as a bonus feat. A character using the unchained rogue class from Pathfinder RPG Pathfinder Unchained instead gains Blind-Fight as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the rogue talent gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Danger Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a rogue gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability counts as trap sense for the purpose of any feat or class prerequisite, and can be replaced by any archetype class feature that replaces trap sense. The bonuses gained from this ability stack with those gained from trap sense (from another class).</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Shadow Step (Sp): </b>At 8th level, a shadow scion can walk through the Shadow Plane and reappear elsewhere on the Material Plane as a standard action. The shadow scion can travel up to 30 feet per rogue level per day in this fashion, either in a single round or broken up across multiple shadow steps. This movement must be used in increments of at least 5 feet and does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Travel through the Shadow Plane is imprecise; when the shadow scion arrives back on the Material Plane, she reenters 1 square off target, as per the rules for thrown splash weapons. If this would place her in an occupied square, she instead arrives in the nearest safe location. When the shadow scion arrives on the Material Plane, she is cloaked in shadow and gains concealment as per the blur spell for 1 round.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the rogue talent gained at 8th level.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Shadow Speaker (Sp): </b>At 14th level, a shadow scion can spend 1 minute meditating within a patch of dim light or darkness; at the end of the time, she can draw information from the shadows. This functions as commune with nature, except that it functions in any terrain to a radius of 100 feet per rogue level, and it cannot reveal information about any object or subject that is not currently in dim light or darkness. The shadow scion can use this ability once per day at 14th level and twice per day at 19th level.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the rogue talent gained at 14th level.</p>
			<p><b>Shadow Master (Su): </b>At 20th level, whenever a shadow scion is in an area of dim light, she gains DR 10/cold iron and a +2 luck bonus on all saving throws. In addition, whenever she confirms a critical hit against a foe that is in an area of dim light, that foe is blinded for 1d6 rounds.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces master strike.</p>

				<name type="string">Debilitating Injury</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Aquatic elven adventurers descending into the ruins of sunken Azlant developed techniques to ease their explorations, and they now share these techniques among a loose group of acquaintances calling themselves the seekers of the lost. These aquatic elves eagerly explore trap-laden ruins of all types, using their skills to bypass traps and dispatch animated guardians put in place long ago by the lost cities&#146; original founders. These seekers rarely travel far inland, though they may journey to larger landlocked bodies of water, such as Lake Encarthan, to explore submerged ruins there.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>A rogue adds 1/2 her level on Perception checks to locate traps and on Disable Device checks (minimum +1). A rogue can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Arcana Breaker (Su): </b>Typically, only magical traps survive for long periods underwater, so a seeker of the lost specializes in noticing and disarming such traps. At 3rd level, a seeker of the lost gains a +1 competence bonus on Perception checks to notice magical traps and on Disable Device checks to disarm magical traps. This bonus increases by an additional +1 every 3 levels beyond 3rd (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the 2nd-level rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Danger Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a rogue gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability counts as trap sense for the purpose of any feat or class prerequisite, and can be replaced by any archetype class feature that replaces trap sense. The bonuses gained from this ability stack with those gained from trap sense (from another class).</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Underwater Striker (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a seeker of the lost gains the ability to strike precisely underwater. When a seeker of the lost makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon, the damage is not halved for being made underwater, as is usually the case for attacks that deal slashing or bludgeoning damage or, if the rogue is offbalance, attacks that deal piercing damage (see Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Aquatic Adventures for more information about being off-balance). In addition, when a seeker of the lost makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon against a construct, she ignores any hardness the construct has.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Wary Disarm (Ex): </b>At 8th level, whenever a seeker of the lost attempts to disarm a trap using Disable Device, she does not spring the trap unless she fails by an amount equal to her rogue level or more. If she does set off a trap she was attempting to disarm, she doubles her trap sense bonus to avoid the trap.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>At 1st level, the Sczarni swindler can declare two different actions that rely on different types of rolls or checks, such as attacking a creature (an attack roll) or sneaking past the same creature (a Stealth check). As a standard action, the swindler then uses a random method to choose one of the declared activities, such as flipping a coin, rolling a die, or drawing a harrow card. The specific method doesn&#146;t matter as long as there is an equal chance of either activity being chosen. If the swindler then performs the chosen activity within the next round, she gains a luck bonus on the roll type required for that activity&#151;attack rolls with a specific weapon, a specific skill check, a specific ability check, or a specific saving throw&#151;equal to half her rogue level (minimum +1) for 1 minute. If the swindler performs any other action (whether declared or not) in the round after using this ability, she becomes shaken for 1 minute instead. The swindler can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>If life is a game, the Sczarni play to win. When skill and luck aren&#146;t enough, cheating is often the best option.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>8 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Let Fate Decide (Ex): </b>At 1st level, the Sczarni swindler can declare two different actions that rely on different types of rolls or checks, such as attacking a creature (an attack roll) or sneaking past the same creature (a Stealth check). As a standard action, the swindler then uses a random method to choose one of the declared activities, such as flipping a coin, rolling a die, or drawing a harrow card. The specific method doesn&#146;t matter as long as there is an equal chance of either activity being chosen. If the swindler then performs the chosen activity within the next round, she gains a luck bonus on the roll type required for that activity&#151;attack rolls with a specific weapon, a specific skill check, a specific ability check, or a specific saving throw&#151;equal to half her rogue level (minimum +1) for 1 minute. If the swindler performs any other action (whether declared or not) in the round after using this ability, she becomes shaken for 1 minute instead. The swindler can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Quicker Than the Eye (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, when the Sczarni swindler uses Sleight of Hand, creatures take a penalty on their Perception checks equal to half the swindler&#146;s class level to notice the attempt. The swindler also reduces the normal &#150;20 penalty by an amount equal to her class level when attempting a Sleight of Hand check as a move action instead of as a standard action. Lastly, the swindler can draw hidden weapons or objects from her person as a move action instead of the usual standard action. This ability replaces evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Poker Face (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, the Sczarni swindler gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Profession (gambler), and Sense Motive checks. This bonus increases by 1 for every 3 levels beyond 3rd. The Sczarni swindler can also attempt to feint against non-humanoid targets without penalty, though she still takes a &#150;8 penalty on feint attempts against creatures with animal intelligence and she cannot feint against mindless creatures. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>No Fool (Ex): </b>At 4th level, the Sczarni swindler gains a +1 bonus on Will saving throws. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels beyond 4th (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level). This ability replaces uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Cheat Fate (Ex): </b>At 8th level, once per day, the Sczarni swindler can reroll any one d20 roll she has just made before the GM has revealed the result. She must take the result of the second roll, even if it is worse. The swindler can use this ability twice per day at 14th level, and three times per day at 20th. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability).

					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The scroll scoundrel is a rogue archetype that relies on cunning and quick wits to stay alive. He excels in exploiting overconfidence and predictability, using knowledge he&#146;s gained from his extensive research and field experience combined with hearsay and recent observations to react to problems as soon as they arise with swift but unnaturally accurate guesswork. A scroll scoundrel is often called upon by the Pathfinders to undertake missions where killing a foe isn&#146;t nearly as important as humiliating them in public duels or similar conf licts. A scroll scoundrel has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>A rogue adds 1/2 her level on Perception checks to locate traps and on Disable Device checks (minimum +1). A rogue can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Fast Talker (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a scroll scoundrel&#146;s penalty on Bluff checks that are unlikely, farfetched, or impossible to achieve is reduced by 5. When he makes a Diplomacy check to adjust a creature&#146;s starting attitude, he gains a +3 competence bonus on the skill check. This ability replaces the rogue&#146;s 2nd-level rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Adaptive Learning (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, a scroll scoundrel gains a +1 bonus on saving throws against abilities and spells he has already successfully saved against within the past minute (even if the spells or abilities in question were used by different creatures). This bonus increases by +1 when the scroll scoundrel reaches 6th level, and by an additional +1 for every three levels thereafter, to a maximum of +6 at 18th level. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Pay it Back (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a scroll scoundrel receives a +1 bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls against foes who made melee attacks against him in the previous round. This bonus increases to +2 at 10th level. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Elusive Gambit (Ex): </b>At 6th level, a scroll scoundrel&#146;s movement can leave a foe off-balance. If a scroll scoundrel provokes an attack of opportunity by moving past an opponent and that opponent then misses with the attack, that foe is considered to be f lat-footed against the scroll scoundrel&#146;s next melee attack, provided that melee attack comes within 1 round of the missed attack of opportunity. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Spot Weakness (Ex): </b>At 10th level, a scroll scoundrel can discover a weakness in his enemy&#146;s defenses as a swift action. His next successful hit in the same round ignores 5 points of the foe&#146;s damage reduction or hardness. At 15th level, he ignores the first 10 points, and at 20th level, the first 15 points. If the attack deals any sneak attack damage, he ignores all of the foe&#146;s damage reduction or hardness for that attack. He cannot use this ability on foes that are immune to critical hits. This ability replaces the scroll scoundrel&#146;s 10th-level rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>

A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Not all rogues live in the city. Scouts frequently roam the wilderness, often banding together as bandits, but sometimes serving as guides, as trailblazers, or as companions to a ranger or barbarian warrior. More comfortable with sneaking and hiding outdoors, the scout is still effective in the city and the dungeon.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>A rogue adds 1/2 her level on Perception checks to locate traps and on Disable Device checks (minimum +1). A rogue can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Danger Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a rogue gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability counts as trap sense for the purpose of any feat or class prerequisite, and can be replaced by any archetype class feature that replaces trap sense. The bonuses gained from this ability stack with those gained from trap sense (from another class).</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Scout&#146;s Charge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a scout makes a charge, her attack deals sneak attack damage as if the target were flat-footed. Foes with uncanny dodge are immune to this ability. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Skirmisher (Ex): </b>At 8th level, whenever a scout moves more than 10 feet in a round and makes an attack action, the attack deals sneak attack damage as if the target was flat-footed. If the scout makes more than one attack this turn, this ability only applies to the first attack. Foes with uncanny dodge are immune to this ability. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

				<name type="string">Debilitating Injury</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The sapper is a trained siege engineer and can deal with traps and other obstacles given plenty of time.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Destructive Dismantle (Ex): </b>A sapper is able to quickly breach obstacles. Using a combination of engineering, explosives, alchemical reagents, and sheer bloodymindedness, she can deal up to 10 points of damage per sapper level upon an object once per day, ignoring the object&#146;s hardness. She might crack open a stone wall with an explosive charge, or collapse a ceiling by tunneling through its supports. This ability requires 1d4+1 hours of preparation, so it can be used only on immobile and unresisting objects. This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Sapping (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a sapper gains a +4 bonus on Perception or Disable Device checks to find or disable traps. She also grants a +4 bonus when using the aid another action to assist with Strength checks to lift gates, bend bars, or force open doors. However, the sapper is focused, so it takes her a full-round action to complete any aid another action. This ability replaces her 2nd-level rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Danger Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a rogue gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability counts as trap sense for the purpose of any feat or class prerequisite, and can be replaced by any archetype class feature that replaces trap sense. The bonuses gained from this ability stack with those gained from trap sense (from another class).</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Fence (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a sapper loots a dungeon or other adventuring complex of its mundane goods and sells them to her various contacts. These mundane goods include things like brass fittings, stewpots, scrap metal, and so on. The sapper automatically loots this junk while in the dungeon, and must spend 24 uninterrupted hours selling the objects in town. She shares a portion of the proceeds with the adventurers; the amount typically equals 1d10 gp per sapper level per dungeon. This ability replaces her 4thlevel rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 6th level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 6th level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The sanctified rogue serves a higher purpose, acting as a representative of a church or cult, or following the tenets of a specific faith or deity. While most sanctified rogues share the beliefs or ideals of the religions they represent, not all of them are necessarily pious. A handful of disreputable holy thieves serve purely as mercenaries. At the other end of spectrum, however, more sanctified rogues adhere to the tenets of their faith with fanatical devotion. Regardless, all seem blessed with the ability to call upon divine favor to aid them in times of need.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>A rogue adds 1/2 her level on Perception checks to locate traps and on Disable Device checks (minimum +1). A rogue can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Danger Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a rogue gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability counts as trap sense for the purpose of any feat or class prerequisite, and can be replaced by any archetype class feature that replaces trap sense. The bonuses gained from this ability stack with those gained from trap sense (from another class).</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Divine Purpose (Su): </b>At 4th level, the favor of a deity or religious institution grants a special blessing on a sanctified rogue, shoring up some of her weaknesses. She gains a +1 sacred bonus on Fortitude and Will saving throws. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Divine Epiphany (Su): </b>At 8th level, once per day, a sanctified rogue can peer into the immediate future and predict the results of a specific action as if she had cast an augury spell. The caster level of this spell is equal to the sanctified rogue&#146;s rogue class level. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
					<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
					<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, a rotdrinker gains immunity to all ingested poisons, including poisons that are converted to or considered ingested poisons (such as a poison converted to an ingested poison using the alchemist&#146;s poison conversion discovery).</p>
					<p>Further, when the rotdrinker ingests an ingested poison, she gains a number of temporary hit points equal to half her rogue level. These temporary hit points stack with temporary hit points from other effects, and they last until they are lost or for a number of rounds equal to the rotdrinker&#146;s rogue level, whichever comes first.</p>
					<p>Additionally, the rotdrinker gains benefits from the ingested poisons that she ingests depending on the poison&#146;s details, as explained below. A rotdrinker can gain hit points and additional benefits from only one ingested poison at a time. If she ingests another poison while she has temporary hit points and additional benefits from another poison, the previous temporary hit points and benefits are lost. At 8th level, the temporary hit points and additional benefits last for a number of minutes equal to the rotdrinker&#146;s rogue level.</p>
					<p>Ingested poisons provide an alchemical bonus equal to the number of consecutive saving throws required to cure the poison (for example, lich dust provides a +2 bonus). An ingested poison that affects Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution grants this bonus on the rotdrinker&#146;s damage rolls and Fortitude saving throws. An ingested poison that affects Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma instead grants this bonus on the rotdrinker&#146;s attack rolls and Will saving throws. An ingested poison that does not affect any ability scores (such as oil of taggit) grants this bonus to the rotdrinker&#146;s AC. If an ingested poison falls into more than one of these categories, the rotdrinker chooses which benefit she receives at the time of ingestion.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Poisons are common tools in a rogue&#146;s trade, and some poison-using rogues are so frequently exposed to these toxins that they have developed resistances to particular poisons. Known as rotdrinkers, these rogues purposefully consume poisons to augment their minds and bodies, though they do so at the expense of traditional roguish nimbleness. This archetype is appropriate for rogues built using the Core Rulebook as well for unchained rogues.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>A rogue adds 1/2 her level on Perception checks to locate traps and on Disable Device checks (minimum +1). A rogue can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Resistance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rotdrinker gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against all poisons. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level.</p>
			<p>This replaces evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Danger Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a rogue gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability counts as trap sense for the purpose of any feat or class prerequisite, and can be replaced by any archetype class feature that replaces trap sense. The bonuses gained from this ability stack with those gained from trap sense (from another class).</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Unnatural Ingestion (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rotdrinker gains immunity to all ingested poisons, including poisons that are converted to or considered ingested poisons (such as a poison converted to an ingested poison using the alchemist&#146;s poison conversion discovery).</p>
			<p>Further, when the rotdrinker ingests an ingested poison, she gains a number of temporary hit points equal to half her rogue level. These temporary hit points stack with temporary hit points from other effects, and they last until they are lost or for a number of rounds equal to the rotdrinker&#146;s rogue level, whichever comes first.</p>
			<p>Additionally, the rotdrinker gains benefits from the ingested poisons that she ingests depending on the poison&#146;s details, as explained below. A rotdrinker can gain hit points and additional benefits from only one ingested poison at a time. If she ingests another poison while she has temporary hit points and additional benefits from another poison, the previous temporary hit points and benefits are lost. At 8th level, the temporary hit points and additional benefits last for a number of minutes equal to the rotdrinker&#146;s rogue level.</p>
			<p>Ingested poisons provide an alchemical bonus equal to the number of consecutive saving throws required to cure the poison (for example, lich dust provides a +2 bonus). An ingested poison that affects Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution grants this bonus on the rotdrinker&#146;s damage rolls and Fortitude saving throws. An ingested poison that affects Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma instead grants this bonus on the rotdrinker&#146;s attack rolls and Will saving throws. An ingested poison that does not affect any ability scores (such as oil of taggit) grants this bonus to the rotdrinker&#146;s AC. If an ingested poison falls into more than one of these categories, the rotdrinker chooses which benefit she receives at the time of ingestion.</p>
			<p>This replaces improved uncanny dodge and uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue.

					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A specialized urban acrobat, the roof runner makes her home high atop the spires and gables of great cities. She is skilled at traveling these uneven surfaces at full speed, performing daring leaps and deftly balancing upon narrow and precarious ledges.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Roof Running (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a roof runner becomes entirely adept at moving across the tops of buildings, spires, and similar locations. Provided she is wearing light armor or no armor, the roof runner can move at full speed while traveling across the tops of buildings or similar structures, and takes no penalties on any Dexterity-based Skill checks or Reflex saves that might be incurred from moving about on a roof. This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Tumbling Descent (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a roof runner can use her acrobatics skill to attempt a rapid descent from a rooftop or another surface, ricocheting against another surface and then diving through an opening (such as a balcony or window) directly below. So long as she has at least two surfaces no farther than 10 feet apart to bounce against, she can ricochet her body back from one to the next, descending great distances with a single check. The DC is 10 + 5 for every additional 10-foot increment descended beyond the initial 10 feet dropped. If she fails, she falls the full distance. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier.

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>What highway robbers are to roads, river rats are to waterways. Skilled at hiding amid reeds and roots, these rogues strike the unwary from the shallows as others would from the shadows. Despite their strong association with banditry, river rats make excellent guides and hunters.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>8 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Swamper (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a river rat gains a bonus equal to half her rogue level on Swim checks (minimum +1).</p>
			<p>A river rat ignores difficult terrain caused by light undergrowth and shallow bogs, and it costs her only 2 squares of movement to enter a square of deep bog or heavy undergrowth, rather than 4 squares of movement. She takes no penalty on Acrobatics or Stealth checks for being in bogs and undergrowth. All of these abilities apply only when she is wearing light or no armor and carrying no more than a light load.</p>
			<p>This replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Rat&#146;s Resilience (Ex): </b>A river rat is inured to dangers presented by disease-carrying parasites, poisonous fish, and other toxic river denizens. At 3rd level, a river rat gains a +1 bonus on saving throws against disease and poison effects. This bonus increases by 1 every 3 levels thereafter, to a maximum bonus of +6 at 18th level.</p>
			<p>This replaces trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>

A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Relic raiders are rogues who specialize in recovering treasures from ruins and tombs, some in a quest for knowledge, others out of a desire for riches. In addition to natural dangers and mundane traps, these locations are often protected by ancient curses or the psychic imprints of former occupants. Though not versed in magic, relic raiders learn to unweave these maledictions as easily as they unlock ancient vaults.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>A rogue adds 1/2 her level on Perception checks to locate traps and on Disable Device checks (minimum +1). A rogue can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Danger Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a rogue gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability counts as trap sense for the purpose of any feat or class prerequisite, and can be replaced by any archetype class feature that replaces trap sense. The bonuses gained from this ability stack with those gained from trap sense (from another class).</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Curse Sense (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a relic raider adds 1/2 her rogue level on Perception checks to notice haunts and on Spellcraft checks to identify cursed items (using detect magic or similar effects).</p>
			<p>In addition, the relic raider gains a +1 bonus on saving throws against curses and haunts and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by haunts. These bonuses increase by 1 at 6th level and every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability replaces uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Disable Curse (Su): </b>At 8th level, a relic raider can attempt to disable a curse as she would a magical trap. This ability acts as remove curse, except instead of a caster level check, the relic raider attempts a Disable Device check (DC = 15 + the DC of the curse). Disabling a curse takes 2d4 rounds, and the relic raider cannot take 10 or 20 on this check. A relic raider can use this ability once per day at 8th level. At 12th level and every 4 rogue levels thereafter, a relic raider can use disable curse one additional time per day. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p>A relic raider can select the following advanced talents. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a rogue&#146;s sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision must be made before making the attack roll.</p>
			<p><i>Cursed Strike* (Su): </i>Once per day, when the relic raider would normally deal sneak attack damage, she can instead forgo all bonus damage to attempt to curse her target (as per the spell bestow curse). The save is DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the relic raider&#146;s rogue level + her Intelligence modifier. A relic raider must have the major magic rogue talent before choosing cursed strike. The relic raider can use this ability an additional time per day at 15th level and 20th level.</p>
			<p><i>Etheric Strike* (Su): </i>With a successful sneak attack against haunts or undead, the relic raider can deal her sneak attack damage as positive energy damage rather than physical damage. The additional damage affects undead that are normally immune to sneak attacks because of their lack of a discernible anatomy (such as ghosts). A relic raider can make an etheric strike a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The rake is a rogue who is open about her skills and talents, often to the point of being boastful. Usually she has the protection of an important figure who finds her services useful, but sometimes her bravado is enough to keep enemies away. She is often used as a face for the group for diplomacy, gathering information, negotiations, or to gain the most lucrative contracts and quests from local authorities.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Bravado&#146;s Blade (Ex): </b>When a rake hits an opponent and deals sneak attack damage, she can forgo 1d6 points of that damage and make a free Intimidate check to demoralize the foe. For every additional 1d6 points of sneak attack damage she forgoes, she receives a +5 circumstance bonus on this check. This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Rake&#146;s Smile (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a rake gains a +1 morale bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks. This bonus increases by +1 for every 3 levels beyond 3rd. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some consider poisoning an evil act. The poisoner knows poison is just a tool toward an end, and is no different than any other weapon. Some poisoners see themselves as great equalizers, as they are able to craft weapons that the weakest of creatures can wield to devastating effect, but most have no lofty delusions about their work.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Use (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a poisoner is trained in the use of poison and cannot accidentally poison herself when applying poison to a blade. This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Master Poisoner (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a poisoner can use Craft (alchemy) to change the type of a poison. This requires 1 hour of work with an alchemist&#146;s lab and a Craft (alchemy) skill check with a DC equal to the poison&#146;s DC. If successful, the poison&#146;s type changes to contact, ingested, inhaled, or injury. If the check fails, the poison is ruined. The poisoner also receives a bonus on Craft (alchemy) skill checks when working with poison equal to 1/2 her rogue level. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A planar sneak finds creative ways to defy conventional limitations when trying to overcome extraplanar obstacles.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>A rogue adds 1/2 her level on Perception checks to locate traps and on Disable Device checks (minimum +1). A rogue can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Planar Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a planar sneak gains a +1 bonus on saving throws against all effects with the air, chaos, earth, evil, fire, good, law, or water descriptors. This bonus increases by 1 for every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).</p>
			<p>This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Elemental Execution (Su): </b>At 4th level, a planar sneak treats creatures with the elemental subtype as though they were vulnerable to her sneak attack, but she deals only half as much sneak attack damage as she normally would. She can confirm critical hits against such creatures, though 50% of the time, the critical hit is automatically negated and damage is instead rolled normally. At 8th level, this ability also applies to all outsiders otherwise immune to critical hits and sneak attack damage.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A pirate breaks from the confines of country and king to commit her crimes upon the high seas. She holds allegiance only to her ship and its captain (if even that much is true), and lives a lawless life upon the waves, plundering ships and shorelines as suits her whim.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Sea Legs (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a pirate becomes adept at moving on ships, boats, and similar vessels. She gains the Sea Legs feat as a bonus feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites. This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Swinging Reposition (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a pirate incorporates a ship&#146;s masts, rigging, ropes, sails, and other such structures into her combat style. Provided she is wearing light armor or no armor, when fighting in an environment where such structures exist, the rogue incorporates them into her movement, and does not have to move in a straight line when making either a charge attack or a bull rush combat maneuver. Once she completes her attack or maneuver, she can reposition herself. Immediately after making the charge or bull rush, she can move 5 feet as a free action, even if the charge ends her turn. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. This ability replaces the 2nd-level rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Unflinching (Ex): </b>Pirates are a salty and steadfast lot. At 3rd level, a pirate gains a +1 bonus on saving throws against fear and mind-affecting effects. This bonus increases by +1 for every three levels, to a maximum of +6 at 18th level. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 4th level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 4th level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

Starting at 4th level, if the phantom thief is an unchained rogue, she gains rogue&#146;s edge skill unlocks with each of these skills rather than selecting one skill every 5 levels, and she adds half her rogue level to her number of ranks to determine when she receives a skill unlock (so a 7th level rogue (phantom thief ) with 7 ranks in a chosen skill would count as having 10 ranks and receive the second skill unlock).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Also known as gentleman thieves or lady thieves, phantom thieves don&#146;t know the desperation of a hard life like many rogues. Instead, they come from the ranks of the elite, having grown bored with their finery, and seek thrills from acts of daring, skill, and crime. Phantom thieves don&#146;t need the money, so they often perform acts such as breaking into a secure vault for the thrill, leaving a calling card rather than robbing the place.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Refined Education (Ex): </b>A phantom thief adds Handle Animal, Heal, Ride, Spellcraft, Survival, and all Knowledge skills to her list of class skills. Furthermore, she selects one of her rogue class skills and adds half her rogue level on all skill checks using that skill. At 3rd level and every 2 rogue levels thereafter, she selects an additional rogue class skill and adds half her rogue level on all skill checks using that skill as well. Starting at 4th level, if the phantom thief is an unchained rogue, she gains rogue&#146;s edge skill unlocks with each of these skills rather than selecting one skill every 5 levels, and she adds half her rogue level to her number of ranks to determine when she receives a skill unlock (so a 7th level rogue (phantom thief ) with 7 ranks in a chosen skill would count as having 10 ranks and receive the second skill unlock).</p>
			<p>This ability alters the rogue&#146;s class skills and replaces sneak attack and trapfinding. For an unchained rogue, it also alters rogue&#146;s edge and replaces debilitating injury.</p>
			<p><b>Broad Education (Ex): </b>A phantom thief &#146;s broad studies with expensive tutors keep her up to speed in both martial and magical knowledge, as well as in her skills. She can select the combat trick, minor magic, and major magic rogue talents as many times as she likes, and she can select the Skill Focus feat as a rogue talent, also as many times as she likes. Finally, she can select a vigilante social talent instead of a rogue talent, except for social grace and vigilante social talents that would require her to be a craftsman or professional. For the purpose of vigilante social talents, a phantom thief does not have a vigilante identity and is always considered to be in her social identity.</p>
			<p>This ability alters rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Social Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a phantom thief &#146;s social sixth sense allows her to avoid danger in social situations and to act first when it breaks out. She receives a +1 bonus on Sense Motive checks to avoid being surprised by a foe, on Bluff checks to surprise a foe, and on initiative checks for surprise rounds that involved Bluff and Sense Motive checks to determine surprise. This bonus increases by 1 at 3rd level and every 3 rogue levels thereafter.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master of All (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a phantom thief can reroll any skill check as long as it is a class skill in which she is trained. She must take the second result, even if it is worse. She can use this ability no more than once per minute.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces master strike.</p>

					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The sight of yellow sails on the Inner Sea signals the approach of a ship from Okeno, home port of the most ruthless and feared of all slaving operations. Most who see these sails flee in terror, but some freedom fighters actually endeavor to be captured, knowing that being taken to Stonespine Island in manacles is the easiest way to infiltrate the city, liberate other slaves, and lead them to freedom.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Bond Breaker (Ex): </b>An Okeno liberator adds 1/2 her class level to Escape Artist checks, and never takes a penalty on Disable Device checks when using improvised tools to open locks. This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Covert Commander (Ex): </b>An Okeno liberator grants all allies within 30 feet who are in her line of sight (but not herself ) a +1 competence bonus on Disguise and Stealth checks. This bonus increases by 1 for every 3 levels beyond 3rd. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Catch Off-Guard (Ex): </b>At 4th level, the Okeno liberator is adept at improvising weapons. She gains Catch Off-Guard as a bonus feat. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A Numerian scavenger lives for the discovery of new technological wonders scraped from the depths of the strange ruins, metal caverns, and outlandish junkyards of Numeria. She is well-versed in all the ways that technology can be used to protect sites, as well as the ways in which it can malfunction.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks.

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Technic Training (Ex): </b>A Numerian scavenger adds 1/2 her rogue level to Perception skill checks to locate mechanical or high-tech traps and to Disable Device skill checks against these traps (minimum +1). She gains Technologist as a bonus feat. She cannot use Disable Device to disarm magical traps. This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Danger Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a rogue gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability counts as trap sense for the purpose of any feat or class prerequisite, and can be replaced by any archetype class feature that replaces trap sense. The bonuses gained from this ability stack with those gained from trap sense (from another class).</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Lucky Glitch (Ex): </b>Starting at 4th level, whenever a Numerian scavenger triggers a glitch when using a timeworn technological item, she rolls twice and can choose which of the two glitch effects actually occurs. A Numerian scavenger always adds her level to rolls to determine what kind of glitch occurs, and treats rolls of over 100 as 100. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Robot Slayer (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a Numerian scavenger knows just where to strike robots to incapacitate and disable them. When she deals sneak attack damage to a robot, she ignores all hardness that robot possesses. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>While some assassins and killers prefer to be up front with their poison use, others favor a covert approach. Needlers use subtlety and misdirection to deliver deadly poisons to unsuspecting victims in creative and unorthodox ways. This archetype is appropriate for rogues built using the rules from the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook as well as for unchained rogues.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>A rogue adds 1/2 her level on Perception checks to locate traps and on Disable Device checks (minimum +1). A rogue can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Adroit Poisoner (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a needler gains a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks. This bonus increases to +4 when the needler uses Sleight of Hand to draw a hidden weapon that is coated in poison. At 8th level, these bonuses increase to +4 and +6, respectively.</p>
			<p>This replaces evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Danger Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a rogue gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability counts as trap sense for the purpose of any feat or class prerequisite, and can be replaced by any archetype class feature that replaces trap sense. The bonuses gained from this ability stack with those gained from trap sense (from another class).</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Subtle Poisoning (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a needler can apply a contact or ingested poison to her weapon and deliver it as if it were an injury poison. The poison must be delivered within 1 minute of this application, or it is wasted. The DC of the saving throw to resist the poison decreases by 1 when the needler uses this ability to deliver a contact or ingested poison via injury.</p>
			<p>This replaces uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Needle Poisoner (Ex): </b>At 6th level, a needler can apply a dose of poison to a weapon as a swift action. This ability counts as swift poisoning for the purpose of meeting prerequisites.</p>
			<p>This replaces the rogue talent gained at 6th level.</p>
			<p><b>Concealed Delivery (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a needler learns how to deliver all types of poisons with subtlety. As a standard action, she can deliver an ingested or inhaled poison to a creature within reach by placing a dose of poison on the target&#146;s lips, on the target&#146;s neck, or through other similar contact with the target&#146;s skin as if the poison were a contact poison. Delivering poison in this way requires a successful Sleight of Hand check opposed by the target&#146;s Perception check. The poison is not lost on a failed check, but it must be successfully delivered within 1 minute of the first attempt, or it is wasted.</p>
			<p>This replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue.

					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Where bandits and tyrants prey on merchants and caravans, the nameless shadow preys on bandits and tyrants. Posing as mundane merchants or other harmless travelers, these assassins can hide both within darkness and in the anonymity of a seemingly unimportant crowd. This archetype is appropriate for rogues built using the rules from the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook as well as for unchained rogues.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Harmless Guise (Ex): </b>A nameless shadow gains the dual identity and seamless guise vigilante class features, with the following restrictions. Her social identity must be that of a mundane and nonthreatening member of society, such as a farmer or a merchant. At 6th level, the nameless shadow gains the many guises vigilante social talent. At 8th level, the nameless shadow gains the quick change vigilante social talent. At 14th level, the nameless shadow gains the everyman vigilante social talent. At 18th level, the nameless shadow gains the any guise vigilante social talent.</p>
			<p>Additionally, when a nameless shadow attacks a foe while in a social or mundane identity, her target takes a &#150;2 penalty to AC for the purpose of resolving that attack. This use of harmless guise forces the nameless shadow into her vigilante identity after the attack is completed, and the target (if it survives) then becomes aware of the nameless shadow&#146;s secret. This ability cannot be used on targets that are aware of the nameless shadow&#146;s dual identity.</p>
			<p>This replaces trapfinding and the rogue talents gained at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>A rogue adds 1/2 her level on Perception checks to locate traps and on Disable Device checks (minimum +1). A rogue can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Danger Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a rogue gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability counts as trap sense for the purpose of any feat or class prerequisite, and can be replaced by any archetype class feature that replaces trap sense. The bonuses gained from this ability stack with those gained from trap sense (from another class).</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Face in the Crowd (Ex): </b>At 4th level, so long as there are at least 10 other nonhostile creatures within 30 feet of her, a nameless shadow can use Bluff or Disguise in place of Stealth to hide or for sniping. At 8th level, she can use this ability to hide within a crowd even if she is being observed.</p>
			<p>This replaces the rogue talents gained at 4th and 8th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 12th level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 4 levels of rogue attained after 12th level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>

					<p>At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A master of disguise feels no need to advertise her skills to build a reputation. Instead, she believes that never letting her adversaries know her true identity protects her from bad luck or missteps on a job.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Consummate Actor (Ex): </b>A master of disguise adds half her rogue level (minimum 1) on all Disguise checks and on Bluff checks to stay in character while using Disguise. At 2nd level, she gains the quick disguiseAPG rogue talent, and she can create a disguise twice as quickly as normal even for that rogue talent (she can create a disguise that encompasses only minor details as a standard action).</p>
			<p>This ability replaces trapfinding and the rogue talent gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Danger Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a rogue gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability counts as trap sense for the purpose of any feat or class prerequisite, and can be replaced by any archetype class feature that replaces trap sense. The bonuses gained from this ability stack with those gained from trap sense (from another class).</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Grandmaster of Disguise (Ex): </b>At 10th level, a master of disguise gains the master of disguiseAPG advanced rogue talent and can use it an unlimited number of times per day. Because she must still don a physical disguise to gain this bonus, it doesn&#146;t stack with the bonuses from spells like alter self and disguise self, but since it is completely nonmagical, it is more reliable when scrutinized under magical detection.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the rogue talent gained at 10th level.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
					<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
					<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
					<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>

The makeshift scrapper can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to her rogue level. These rounds need not be consecutive, and the makeshift scrapper can change the enhancement each time she activates the ability.

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some combatants specialize in the study of certain weapons, but those without formal training often learn to survive a fight by making brilliant use of whatever is lying around.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>The makeshift scrapper is proficient with only simple weapons.. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Improvised Weapons (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a makeshift scrapper gains Catch Off-Guard and Throw Anything as bonus feats. This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Supernatural Improvisation (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a makeshift scrapper gains the ability to enhance an item, making it a more effective weapon or changing the way it can be used. As a swift action, she can alter a single improvised weapon to either grant it a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls or use it to gain a +1 shield bonus to her AC. The makeshift scrapper can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to her rogue level. These rounds need not be consecutive, and the makeshift scrapper can change the enhancement each time she activates the ability. The bonus increases by 1 every 4 levels thereafter, up to a maximum bonus of +5 at 19th level. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Improvised Weapon Mastery (Ex): </b>At 12th level, the makeshift scrapper gains Improvised Weapon Mastery as a bonus feat. This ability replaces the rogue talent gained at 12th level.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The knife master is a trained killer who specializes in close-up combat and the wave and weave of knife fighting. In her hands, daggers and other similar light blades become truly deadly instruments..</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Hidden Blade: </b>A knife master adds 1/2 her level on Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal a light blade. This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Stab (Ex): </b>A knife master focuses her ability to deal sneak attack damage with daggers and similar weapons to such a degree that she can deal more sneak attack damage with those weapons at the expense of sneak attacks with other weapons. When she makes a sneak attack with a dagger, kerambit, kukri, punching daggers, starknife, or swordbreaker dagger (Advanced Player&#146;s Guide 178), she uses d8s to roll sneak attack damage instead of d6s. For sneak attacks with all other weapons, she uses d4s instead of d6s. This ability is identical in all other ways to sneak attack, and supplements that ability.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Blade Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a knife master is so skilled in combat involving light blades that she gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made against her with light blades. This bonus increases by +1 for every three levels, to a maximum of +6 at 18th level. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The kitsune trickster combines her sharpened wit with minor arcane powers of charm and persuasion. She uses her talents to spin convincing lies, riddles, and stories. A trickster has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Race: </b>Kitsune Only</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Kitsune&#146;s Guile (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a trickster relies on her intellect as much as her personality. She adds her Intelligence modifier on Bluff, Diplomacy, Disguise, and Sense Motive checks. This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Kitsune&#146;s Charm (Sp): </b>At 3rd level, a kitsune trickster can use charm person once per day as a spell-like ability (caster level equal to her rogue level &#150; 2). At 6th level, and every three levels thereafter, the kitsune trickster gains an additional daily use of this ability. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>With few natural barriers, a thriving international port, and many miles separating it from Egorian, Kintargo is geographically suited for rebellion against the rigid laws that reign in Cheliax. This rebellion is hardly malicious in intent; business is simply easier without the imposing bureaucracy. Whenever the Chelish navy sails into the port, these rebels are quick to appear agreeably subservient in order to conceal their noncompliance and avoid retribution.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>A rogue adds 1/2 her level on Perception checks to locate traps and on Disable Device checks (minimum +1). A rogue can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Sophisticated Stealth (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a Kintargo rebel gains a +1 bonus on Knowledge (nobility) checks. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on Bluff checks to convey a secret message and on Sense Motive checks to discern secret messages. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 rogue levels thereafter. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Misdirection (Sp): </b>At 4th level, a Kintargo rebel gains the ability to cast misdirection on herself once per day, though instead of choosing an object for the second target, she must choose a creature in range. The caster level for this ability is equal to her class level, and the save DC for this spell is 12 + the Kintargo rebel&#146;s Intelligence modifier. The save DC of this ability increases by 1 if the secondary target is lawful or evil. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Not all rogues work against the law. Investigators use their skills to serve the law, often in the employ of nobles or in the pursuit of noble causes. In some cities cabals of investigators work for rulers or bureaucracies, but often an investigator is a free agent who pursues whatever mysteries come across her path. Of course, not all investigators serve the law. Crime lords and guildmasters often have squads of investigators serving their own nefarious purposes.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Follow Up (Ex): </b>An investigator can roll twice on any Diplomacy check made to gather information, and receives the information for both results. This takes the same amount of time as one check. If the lesser of the two checks reveals false information, the rogue is aware of it. False information is not revealed in this way if the people she questioned do not know it to be false. This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Danger Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a rogue gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability counts as trap sense for the purpose of any feat or class prerequisite, and can be replaced by any archetype class feature that replaces trap sense. The bonuses gained from this ability stack with those gained from trap sense (from another class).</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>

A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends.

			<p><i>Notorious for their stealth, imagination, and elaborately planned thefts and capers, heisters specialize in breaking into secure locations, stealing items of value, and escaping undetected. Heisters often work as members of or independent operatives contracted to criminal organizations, crime families, or wealthy individuals inclined to unlawful activity.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>A rogue adds 1/2 her level on Perception checks to locate traps and on Disable Device checks (minimum +1). A rogue can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rum Dubber (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, whenever a heister attempts to open a lock without a set of thieves&#146; tools, the DC increases by 2, instead of 10.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the rogue talent gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Danger Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a rogue gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability counts as trap sense for the purpose of any feat or class prerequisite, and can be replaced by any archetype class feature that replaces trap sense. The bonuses gained from this ability stack with those gained from trap sense (from another class).</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Ferret&#146;s Grace (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a heister gains Stealthy as a bonus feat. Additionally, a heister counts as a creature one size category smaller than she actually is when determining whether or not she is squeezing into an enclosed space (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 193&#150;194). Finally, when a heister uses the Escape Artist skill to move through a tight space where her head fits but her shoulders do not (Core Rulebook 95&#150;96), the DC is 20, instead of 30.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces uncanny dodge and the rogue talent gained at 4th level.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 6th level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 10th level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Unseen (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a heister masters hiding in underground and urban terrain. She can use the Stealth skill to hide in underground and urban terrain, even while being observed. She also gains the terrain masteryUC rogue talent twice, once each for underground and urban terrain.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge and the rogue talent gained at 8th level.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Alkenstar protects the secrets of gunpowder and controls the sale of firearms, creating lucrative opportunities for those who can sneak the technology beyond the Mana Wastes. Gun smugglers are adept at procuring firearms and concealing their secret weapons.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>A gun smuggler is proficient with all simple weapons and one-handed firearms, plus the rapier, sap, short sword, and sword cane.. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Hidden Gun (Ex): </b>A gun smuggler gains a bonus equal to half her rogue level on Sleight of Hand checks to conceal a one-handed firearm on her body. She increases the DCs of opponents&#146; Perception checks to realize the true nature of disguised weapons (such as a sword cane) within 5 feet of her by an amount equal to her rogue level (maximum DC 25 plus her rogue level).</p>
			<p>This replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Secret Sidearm (Ex): </b>As an expert in discreet and easily concealable weapons and firearms, a gun smuggler gains a battered gun identical to that gained by a 1st-level gunslinger and Gunsmithing as a bonus feat (including the ability to restore her battered gun as if she were a gunslinger), though she must select a coat pistol, dagger pistol, or sword cane pistol as her battered weapon.</p>
			<p><b>Selective Targeting (Ex): </b>A gun smuggler focuses on concealable firearms for her sneak attacks. When she makes a sneak attack using any weapon other than a coat pistol, dagger pistol, or sword cane pistol (either firing the weapon or making a melee attack), her sneak attack damage dice are d4s instead of d6s.</p>
			<p>This alters sneak attack.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Stolen Shots (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a gun smuggler can access small quantities of cutting-edge firearm technology through clandestine dealers. She gains the benefits of the black market connections rogue talent, though only for the purpose of securing firearms and related equipment. At the beginning of each day, the gun smuggler gains a number of bullets (with accompanying black powder) or paper cartridges&#151;referred to as shots&#151;in any combination equal to her rogue level, representing ammunition smuggled to her by contacts. Her contacts provide only enough shots to replenish this small supply, so she can&#146;t accumulate ammunition indefinitely, and these shots have a market price of 0 gp.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, the gun smuggler can elect to gain one or more pieces of magic ammunition, though each one replaces a number of her daily shots equal to the ammunition&#146;s enhancement bonus (maximum enhancement bonus of +2 for any one piece of ammunition). She can choose to add any of the following weapon special abilities to the shot, though the shot must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus, and these special abilities use an amount of bonus equal to the ability&#146;s normal price: distance, flaming, flaming burst, merciful, seeking, or thundering. At 9th level and every 3 rogue levels thereafter, the maximum enhancement bonus of a gun smuggler&#146;s shots increases by 1 (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).</p>
			<p>This replaces trap sense and the rogue talent gained at 6th level.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Aim (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a gun smuggler increases the range increment of any coat pistol, dagger pistol, or sword cane pistol she wields by 10 feet. At 8th level, the base damage of bullets fired by these weapons increases by one die step.</p>
			<p>This replaces uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Guild agents are members of a thieves&#146; guild or other shadowy organization. What they lose in independence, they more than make up for in benefits gained due to their association&#146;s infrastructure. Guild agents come at all levels of the organization, from a lowly recruit all the way up to the guildmaster himself.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>8 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>A rogue adds 1/2 her level on Perception checks to locate traps and on Disable Device checks (minimum +1). A rogue can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Honor Among Thieves (Ex): </b>A guild agent must remain a member in good standing of a thieves&#146; guild (he starts at rank 1 with her guild when using the organizational influence system). If the guild agent leaves his guild, he loses all of the abilities granted by this archetype and does not gain their replacements. If he joins a new guild, the guild agent regains his abilities, though depending on how he joins the guild, he may regain his abilities all at once or gradually over time. Even if the guild in question operates in multiple locations, the guild agent chooses a settlement as a base of operations for his own activities.</p>
			<p><b>Guild Connections (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a guild agent gains the black market connectionsUC rogue talent. Furthermore, he can ask his guild for tips about the local scene, granting him a bonus equal to half his rogue level on Knowledge (local) checks and Diplomacy checks to gather information, as long as the information in question pertains to the guild agent&#146;s base of operations.</p>
			<p>At 4th level, the guild agent also gains the gossip collector vigilante social talent and his base of operations counts as his area of renown for the purpose of determining the effects of gossip collector.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces evasion and uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Danger Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a rogue gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability counts as trap sense for the purpose of any feat or class prerequisite, and can be replaced by any archetype class feature that replaces trap sense. The bonuses gained from this ability stack with those gained from trap sense (from another class).</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Pull Rank (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a guild agent has attained sufficient rank to call in lesser guild members to assist him with a job. He can call lesser members of a number and level equal to the number of followers he would have if he had the Leadership feat (including the +2 bonus for his guildhouse), to a maximum of a number of lesser members equal to his rogue level. If the guild agent possesses the Leadership feat, he gains twice as many followers as normal. If he spends a favor, he can combine this with the command team organizational influence benefit to gain even more lesser members for a particularly difficult job. Each time the guild agent uses the lesser members recklessly and gets them killed, he loses at least 1 influence with his guild.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Criminal Mastermind (Ex): </b>At 20th level, except in an unusually powerful guild, a guild agent has become the true power behind the guild. The guild agent has built up a nearly worldwide reputation under a particular criminal epithet (such as &#147;The Silver Shadow&#148;), known by criminals and law enforcement officers everywhere. This works like the renown vigilante social talent except as follows. It applies in all towns and cities on the same continent as the guild agent&#146;s base of operations, without requiring him to select a particular settlement. He has only one identity, and only other criminals and members of the underworld treat their attitudes toward the guild agent as one step closer to helpful at all times (rather than while only in his social identity), while the bonus on Intimidate checks applies against everyone at all times (rather than while only in his vigilante identity).</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Guerrillas fight against oppressive leadership and governments&#151;often under cover of night&#151;including Chelish colonization in Sargava and the power structures in Cheliax proper, Nidal, and Razmiran. Any rogue (including the rogue from Pathfinder Unchained) can select the guerrilla archetype.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>A rogue adds 1/2 her level on Perception checks to locate traps and on Disable Device checks (minimum +1). A rogue can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Danger Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a rogue gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability counts as trap sense for the purpose of any feat or class prerequisite, and can be replaced by any archetype class feature that replaces trap sense. The bonuses gained from this ability stack with those gained from trap sense (from another class).</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
					<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>

					<p>This ability functions as the renown vigilante social talent (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Intrigue 12). In addition to improving attitudes, it also improves the Galtan agitator&#146;s starting influence (Ultimate Intrigue 102) and reputation with contacts (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Campaign 148) in the area by one level or step. For the purpose of vigilante social talents, the Galtan agitator does not have a vigilante identity and is always considered to be in her social identity, unless she has another identity (such as from the vigilante class). If the Galtan agitator has another identity, she does not gain any benefits from renown while in that identity unless she has the renown social talent or a similar ability.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Galtan agitators fight mightily to cast down the enemies of their ideals within the shambles of the tumultuous nation of Galt. Any rogue (including the rogue from Pathfinder RPG Pathfinder Unchained) can select the Galtan agitator archetype.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>8 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Reputation (Ex): </b>This ability functions as the renown vigilante social talent (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Intrigue 12). In addition to improving attitudes, it also improves the Galtan agitator&#146;s starting influence (Ultimate Intrigue 102) and reputation with contacts (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Campaign 148) in the area by one level or step. For the purpose of vigilante social talents, the Galtan agitator does not have a vigilante identity and is always considered to be in her social identity, unless she has another identity (such as from the vigilante class). If the Galtan agitator has another identity, she does not gain any benefits from renown while in that identity unless she has the renown social talent or a similar ability.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Ready for Betrayal (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a Galtan agitator gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to recognize disguises and notice hiding creatures and on Sense Motive checks to disbelieve lies. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).</p>
			<p>This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Enthralling Agitation (Su): </b>At 4th level, a Galtan agitator can captivate a crowd once per day, as per the spell enthrall. (DC = 10 + 1/2 the Galtan agitator&#146;s rogue level + her Charisma modifier). During the spell&#146;s effect, the Galtan agitator can attempt a DC 15 Charisma check to increase her individual or organizational influence with the members of the crowd by 1 rank or step. Or, if the crowd members&#146; attitudes toward the Galtan agitator are indifferent or worse, this check can improve their attitudes by 1 step. The Galtan agitator can never use this ability to increase her individual or organization influence or improve the crowd&#146;s attitude by more than 2 ranks or steps.</p>
			<p>This replaces the rogue talent gained at 4th level.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Revolutionary&#146;s Cause (Su): </b>At 8th level, the Galtan agitator can lift an enthralled crowd&#146;s emotions and turn them toward a common purpose. As a standard action after she has used her enthralling agitation&#151; but before the enthrall effect wears off&#151;she can target the affected creatures with a plausible suggestion (DC = 10 + 1/2 her rogue level + her Charisma modifier). that has a duration of up to 1 day.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the rogue talent gained at 8th level.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Leadership (Ex): </b>At 12th level, a Galtan agitator gains Leadership as a bonus feat. If the Galtan agitator already has the Leadership feat, she doubles her Charisma modifier when calculating her base Leadership score.</p>
			<p>This replaces the rogue talent gained at 12th level.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A filcher steals valuables without their owners even realizing it. Whether cutting purses in the midst of combat or replacing prized items with fakes under the noses of their owners, the filcher is the master of the quick and quiet steal. A filcher has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Race: </b>Halfling Only</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>8 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>A rogue adds 1/2 her level on Perception checks to locate traps and on Disable Device checks (minimum +1). A rogue can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Quicker than the Eye (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a filcher develops an amazingly swift and delicate touch. When she uses Sleight of Hand, creatures take a penalty on their Perception checks to notice the attempt equal to half the filcher&#146;s class level. The filcher also subtracts her class level from the normal &#150;20 penalty when attempting to make a Sleight of Hand check as a move action instead of as a standard action. Lastly, the filcher can withdraw an object hidden on her person, including a weapon, as a move action instead of the usual standard action. This ability replaces evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rummage (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a filcher learns how to assess the value of items at the quickest glance. She can even make startlingly accurate guesses about particular items merely by observing the bulges they make in pouches, backpacks, or similar containers. She gains a +1 bonus on Appraise checks and an additional +1 bonus every three levels thereafter.</p>
			<p>As a swift action, a filcher can make an Appraise check in order to determine the relative value of each object carried by her target (DC = 10 + 1 for every object the filcher is trying to ascertain the relative value of). Though she never learns the actual prices of items when using rummage, she does gain enough information to list these items in order, from the most valuable to the least valuable. She can, by taking a &#150;20 penalty on the check, add to this assessment any items carried by her target that she cannot see. This ability replaces trap sense +1, +2, +3, +4, +5, and +6.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Filch (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a filcher learns how pluck items off her opponents even in combat. She gains Improved Steal as a bonus feat and can use her Sleight of Hand bonus instead of her CMB when performing a steal combat maneuver. If the filcher gains bonuses on combat maneuver checks from any feats, spells, magic items, or similar effects, they are added to the Sleight of Hand bonus when using the steal maneuver. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Superior Filching (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a filcher becomes a master at separating owners from their property. She gains Greater Steal as a bonus feat, and opponents do not gain a +5 bonus to their CMD when she tries to remove items fastened to them. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Fey pranksters specialize in tricking others to teach a lesson or for their own entertainment.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Race: </b>Gaitlain Only</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>8 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Treacherous Plants (Sp): </b>The fey prankster can cause plants to distract nearby creatures. To use this ability, the fey prankster attempts a Bluff check to create a distraction to hide as a swift action or to feint against an adjacent opponent as a move action, so long as the target is adjacent to plants. He gains a bonus on this check equal to half his rogue level (minimum +1).</p>
			<p>This replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Dirty Trick: </b>At 2nd level, the fey prankster gains Improved Dirty Trick as a bonus feat. He need not meet the prerequisites.</p>
			<p>This replaces the rogue talent gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Danger Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a rogue gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability counts as trap sense for the purpose of any feat or class prerequisite, and can be replaced by any archetype class feature that replaces trap sense. The bonuses gained from this ability stack with those gained from trap sense (from another class).</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Steal Appearance (Sp): </b>At 4th level, the fey prankster can exchange the appearance of two adjacent items of the same size. He can also exchange the appearance of two creatures if at least one is willing and both are adjacent. Affecting an unwilling creature or an item it wears or carries requires a successful dirty trick combat maneuver against that creature. If he succeeds, the objects or creatures are each disguised as the other as if with veil cast at his rogue level. The Will save DC to resist or disbelieve the illusion is equal to 10 + half the rogue&#146;s level + his Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the fey prankster can also exchange the locations of the two targets by succeeding at a DC 20 Sleight of Hand check. If he succeeds, observers can&#146;t tell which is the original based on movement without succeeding at a Perception check against his Sleight of Hand result.</p>
			<p>This replaces uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Dirty Trick: </b>At 6th level, the fey prankster gains Greater Dirty Trick as a bonus feat. He does not need to meet the prerequisites.</p>
			<p>This replaces the rogue talent gained at 6th level.</p>
			<p><b>Plant Traps (Su): </b>At 8th level, the fey trickster can modify a plant (but not plant creatures) into a trap as a full-round action up to three times per day. The Perception and Disable Device DCs for the trap are each equal to 15 + his rogue level. A Tiny or larger plant can be used to perform a trip or dirty trick combat maneuver using the fey trickster&#146;s CMB and the plant&#146;s size. A Large or larger plant can be used to create a snare as per the spell. The save DC is equal to 12 + the rogue&#146;s Intelligence modifier. The fey trickster can trigger any plant trap he created as a standard action as long as he is within 60 feet of it.</p>
			<p>This replaces the rogue talent gained at 8th level.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Unseen Trickster: </b>At 12th level, the fey trickster can attempt Stealth checks in areas with plants even if he does not have cover or concealment.</p>
			<p>This replaces the rogue talent gained at 12th level.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level, the false medium exploits his natural talent for deception to convince others of the presence of false supernatural entities. As long as the false medium is in conditions of dim light or darkness, he can use Bluff skill checks to emulate the effects of dancing lights, ghost sound, silent image, or ventriloquism by throwing his voice, subtly misdirecting or convincing subjects, or manipulating light and shadows. The range of these effects is 10 feet from the false medium, plus an additional 5 feet for every 3 rogue levels he possesses beyond 3rd. The effects last for 1 round, though they can be maintained with additional checks. Only one of these effects can be created or maintained in a given round. Observers can attempt either a Perception or Sense Motive check (whichever of their bonuses is higher) to oppose this Bluff check; the GM should roll these checks secretly. This is an extraordinary ability and not an illusion, so if the false medium succeeds at the opposed check, even powerful effects like true seeing don&#146;t detect the fakery.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier.

When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Dim the Lights (Ex): </b>At 1st level, while in dim light or darkness, a false medium adds 1/2 his rogue level as a bonus on Bluff, Disguise, and Sleight of Hand checks, and creatures without low-light vision or darkvision take an equal penalty on skill checks to oppose the false medium&#146;s Bluff, Disguise, and Sleight of Hand checks. This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>False Sensitivity (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a charlatan can convincingly fake the ability to use occult skill unlocks such as automatic writing and dowsing. An untrained onlooker can&#146;t tell the difference between the false medium&#146;s scams and a true use of occult skill unlocks. An onlooker capable of using the particular occult skill unlock that the false medium is faking can attempt the appropriate skill check for that unlock, opposed by the false medium&#146;s Bluff check, to detect the fraud. In any case, any results of the false medium&#146;s charades are fabricated (for instance, the false medium might ask leading questions to elicit false memories while pretending to use hypnotism). This ability replaces the 2nd-level rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Haunting Presences (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, the false medium exploits his natural talent for deception to convince others of the presence of false supernatural entities. As long as the false medium is in conditions of dim light or darkness, he can use Bluff skill checks to emulate the effects of dancing lights, ghost sound, silent image, or ventriloquism by throwing his voice, subtly misdirecting or convincing subjects, or manipulating light and shadows. The range of these effects is 10 feet from the false medium, plus an additional 5 feet for every 3 rogue levels he possesses beyond 3rd. The effects last for 1 round, though they can be maintained with additional checks. Only one of these effects can be created or maintained in a given round. Observers can attempt either a Perception or Sense Motive check (whichever of their bonuses is higher) to oppose this Bluff check; the GM should roll these checks secretly. This is an extraordinary ability and not an illusion, so if the false medium succeeds at the opposed check, even powerful effects like true seeing don&#146;t detect the fakery.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The escapologist excels at escaping any confinement, whether physical, magical, or mental. Few restraints can hold an escapologist for long.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Elusive: </b>An escapologist adds 1/2 her rogue level (minimum +1) as a bonus on all Disable Device and Escape Artist checks. An escapologist can use Disable Device to disarm magical traps. This ability replaces trapfinding, but counts as trapfinding for the purposes of prerequisites and abilities that require trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Danger Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a rogue gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability counts as trap sense for the purpose of any feat or class prerequisite, and can be replaced by any archetype class feature that replaces trap sense. The bonuses gained from this ability stack with those gained from trap sense (from another class).</p>
			<p><b>Unfettered Mind (Su): </b>At 3rd level, an escapologist can attempt an Escape Artist check as a full-round action to remove a mind-affecting effect currently affecting her. The DC of this check is equal to the effect&#146;s original save DC + 20. She cannot remove effects that do not allow a saving throw. She can attempt to escape even if paralyzed or restrained, as long as she can take purely mental actions. She can attempt this check against a particular effect once per round if the effect is measured in rounds, once per minute if the effect is measured in minutes, once per 10 minutes if the effect is measured in 10-minute intervals, and so on. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Impossible Escape (Su): </b>At 8th level, as an immediate action, an escapologist can attempt an Escape Artist check at a &#150;10 penalty and apply the result in place of either a failed Reflex save or her AC against an attack that would have hit her. If she succeeds, her contortions let her avoid the attack or effect entirely. Using this ability leaves the escapologist staggered until the end of her next turn. If the escapologist can&#146;t become staggered, she can&#146;t use impossible escape. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Students of arcane magic, legerdemain, and stealth, eldritch scoundrels are a rare breed of adventurer most commonly found seeking lost and valuable arcane writings in the ruins of fallen empires, such as Thassilon or the Jistka Imperium.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Disable Device (Dex), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. An eldritch scoundrel is not proficient with any armor or shields. Armor sometimes interferes with an eldritch scoundrel&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 83). This alters the rogue&#146;s armor proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An eldritch scoundrel casts arcane spells drawn from the wizard spell list. An eldritch scoundrel must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time. She learns, prepares, and casts spells exactly as a wizard does, including adding new spells to her spellbook and gaining two additional spells known (of any level she can cast) each time she gains a rogue level with this archetype.</p>
			<p>An eldritch scoundrel can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is the same as the magus class (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 10).</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>A rogue adds 1/2 her level on Perception checks to locate traps and on Disable Device checks (minimum +1). A rogue can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Alarm Sense (Su): </b>At 3rd level, an eldritch scoundrel gains an intuitive sense that warns her when she is near a magic trap. This functions as the trap spotter rogue talent, but applies only if the eldritch scoundrel comes within 10 feet of a magic trap. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack (Ex): </b>The eldritch scoundrel doesn&#146;t acquire the sneak attack class feature until 3rd level, when she gains a +1d6 sneak attack. This increases by 1d6 at 7th level, and again at every 4 rogue levels thereafter. This modifies the rogue&#146;s normal sneak attack progression.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the eldritch scoundrel gains a rogue or ninja talent for which she meets the prerequisites (treating her rogue level as her ninja level). If a talent requires her to expend points from her ki pool, she can instead expend a spell slot with a spell level equal to the number of ki points she would normally expend. If a talent functions only if she has ki in her ki pool, it functions as long as she still has a spell of 1st level or higher prepared. At 12th level, she can select an advanced talent in place of a rogue talent. This modifies the normal rogue talent progression and advanced talent.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Training: </b>An eldritch scoundrel does not gain uncanny dodge or improved uncanny dodge. Beginning at 4th level, she can take uncanny dodge instead of a rogue talent. Beginning at 12th level, the eldritch scoundrel can choose to take improved uncanny dodge in place of an advanced talent. This modifies uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>An eldritch raider is a rogue who seeks to unravel the mysteries of the destruction of the gillmen&#146;s homeland. They explore old ruins that date back to the days of the old human empire and track down relics and lore from its glory days. An eldritch raider has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>A rogue adds 1/2 her level on Perception checks to locate traps and on Disable Device checks (minimum +1). A rogue can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Detect Magic (Sp): </b>At 2nd level, an eldritch raider gains the ability to use detect magic at will. The eldritch raider treats her rogue level as her caster level for this ability. This ability counts as the minor magic rogue talent for purposes of qualifying for other rogue talents. This ability replaces the rogue talent rogues gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Eldritch Intuition (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, an eldritch raider gains an intuitive sense that allows her to more easily activate sorcerer and wizard spell completion and spell trigger items. She gains a +1 bonus on Use Magic Device checks for this purpose. This bonus increases to +2 at 6th level, +3 at 9th level, +4 at 12th level, +5 at 15th level, and +6 at 18th level. This ability replaces the trap sense class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 4th level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 4th level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p>An eldritch raider has access to the following new advanced talents when selecting rogue advanced talents.</p>
			<p><i>Major Eldritch Magic (Sp): </i>The eldritch raider gains the ability to cast a 3rd-level spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list two times per day as a spell-like ability. The caster level for this ability is equal to her rogue level. The save DC for this spell is 13 + her Intelligence modifier. The eldritch raider must have an Intelligence of at least 13 to select this talent. The eldritch raider must have the major magic, minor eldritch magic, and minor magic rogue talents before choosing this talent.</p>
			<p><i>Minor Eldritch Magic (Sp): </i>The eldritch raider gains the ability to cast a 2nd-level spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list two times per day as a spell-like ability. The caster level for this ability is equal to her rogue level. The save DC for this spell is 12 + her Intelligence modifier. The eldritch raider must have an Intelligence of at least 12 to select this talent. The eldritch raider must have the major magic and minor magic rogue talents before choosing this talent.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>

At the start of each day, an earthshadow gains a pool of earthcraft points equal to half her rogue level plus her Wisdom modifier, and she can spend earthcraft points to use certain spell-like abilities. The caster level of these spell-like abilities is equal to the earthshadow&#146;s rogue level. Earthcraft effects affect only the earthshadow, even if the spell could normally affect others. She can spend 1 earthcraft point to cast blend (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Race Guide 29), even if she is not an elf, but this ability works only in areas of natural earth or unworked stone.</p>
					<p>At 4th level, an earthshadow can spend 2 earthcraft points to cast meld into stone.</p>
					<p>At 8th level, an earthshadow can spend 3 earthcraft points to cast dimension door. She must be able to see her destination (or she must be able to otherwise sense its surface, such as with tremorsense), and her current location must be connected to her destination by continuous natural earth or unworked stone.</p>

				<name type="string">Debilitating Injury</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>When the dwarves began their Quest for Sky millennia ago to reach the world&#146;s surface, they already had a deep understanding of the earth&#146;s secrets. In the centuries since, the mystic lore the dwarves call earthcraft has been passed down through the generations, and its practitioners are called earthshadows. While many earthshadows are dwarves, their secrets have been shared with a worthy few members of other races over the ages.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Earthlink (Su): </b>The earth grants an earthshadow swiftness and hones her senses. When an earthshadow is in direct contact with an expanse of natural earth or unworked stone that is at least as large as she is, she adds half her rogue level (minimum 1) to Acrobatics and Perception checks.</p>
			<p>This replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Earthcraft (Su): </b>At 2nd level, an earthshadow can draw upon the power of earth to perform mystical tricks. At the start of each day, an earthshadow gains a pool of earthcraft points equal to half her rogue level plus her Wisdom modifier, and she can spend earthcraft points to use certain spell-like abilities. The caster level of these spell-like abilities is equal to the earthshadow&#146;s rogue level. Earthcraft effects affect only the earthshadow, even if the spell could normally affect others. She can spend 1 earthcraft point to cast blend (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Race Guide 29), even if she is not an elf, but this ability works only in areas of natural earth or unworked stone.</p>
			<p>At 4th level, an earthshadow can spend 2 earthcraft points to cast meld into stone.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, an earthshadow can spend 3 earthcraft points to cast dimension door. She must be able to see her destination (or she must be able to otherwise sense its surface, such as with tremorsense), and her current location must be connected to her destination by continuous natural earth or unworked stone.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, an earthshadow can spend 5 earthcraft points to cast the spell stone tell but can communicate only with unworked stone.</p>
			<p>At 16th level, an earthshadow can spend 6 earthcraft points to cast statue.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces evasion and the rogue talents gained at 4th, 8th, 12th, and 16th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Danger Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a rogue gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability counts as trap sense for the purpose of any feat or class prerequisite, and can be replaced by any archetype class feature that replaces trap sense. The bonuses gained from this ability stack with those gained from trap sense (from another class).</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A driver makes her living driving vehicles in the service of those who can pay for her considerable talents. She may be a wagon-driver practiced at smuggling contraband, an accomplished musher blazing arctic trails, or a seemingly refined coach driver placing her roguish talents in the service of a wealthy patron. This archetype works best with the vehicle combat rules in Chapter 4.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Hard Drive (Ex): </b>When driving a vehicle that uses a group of animals or magical beasts as muscle propulsion, the DCs of all driving checks are reduced by 2, the maximum speed of the vehicle increases by 10 feet, and the acceleration increases by 5 feet. This ability takes the place of trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Driver&#146;s Fortitude (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, the driver learns to keep driving and maintain control of her vehicle, even when mortally wounded. If the driver drops below 0 hit points but is not dead, she can attempt a DC 15 Fortitude save each round to remain conscious and in control of her vehicle, though she may take no other actions. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a dreamthief selects an emotional focus from among those available to a spiritualist&#146;s phantom. She gains the abilities granted by that emotional focus (with the exception of the focus determining her good saving throws&#151;she retains the typical rogue saves). For each of the two skills associated with that emotional focus, a dreamthief gains ranks in that skill equal to her rogue level; this does not allow her ranks in these skills to exceed her Hit Dice.</p>
					<p>A dreamthief is considered to be both a phantom and a spiritualist for the purpose of emotional focus abilities whose effect references both a phantom and a spiritualist, such as dutiful strike, and she treats her rogue level as both her spiritualist level and her phantom Hit Dice when determining abilities and save DCs.</p>
					<p>Once per round when a dreamthief makes a melee attack, she can declare that attack to be a dreamstrike. This does not require an action, but a dreamthief must declare a dreamstrike before making the attack roll. A dreamstrike is treated as a slam attack for the purpose of emotional focus abilities that apply to a phantom&#146;s slam attacks, such as miserable strike. At 20th level, any melee attack a dreamthief makes automatically gains this benefit.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The dreamthief is master of both waking and dreaming worlds. Each dreamthief bears a focused fragment of emotion, known as a dreamshard, within her soul. Some are born with such fragments, while others gain their dreamshards during traumatic moments, especially those involving nightmares, attacks by ethereal beings, or incidents that take place in the Dimension of Dreams. Whether a dreamshard is shaped from the dreamer&#146;s aggregated emotions or manifested from a repressed aspect of herself, this metaphysical crystal grants a dreamthief supernatural powers, which she supplements with skill and grace.</i></p>
			<p><i>Dreamthieves&#146; powers grant them enhanced access to dreamscapes. Using the unique power of her dreamshard, a knowledgeable dreamthief can crystallize and steal dreamers&#146; deepest emotions. Such theft can alter dreamers in profound ways, whether for better or worse.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Dreamshard Focus (Su): </b>At 1st level, a dreamthief selects an emotional focus from among those available to a spiritualist&#146;s phantom. She gains the abilities granted by that emotional focus (with the exception of the focus determining her good saving throws&#151;she retains the typical rogue saves). For each of the two skills associated with that emotional focus, a dreamthief gains ranks in that skill equal to her rogue level; this does not allow her ranks in these skills to exceed her Hit Dice.</p>
			<p>A dreamthief is considered to be both a phantom and a spiritualist for the purpose of emotional focus abilities whose effect references both a phantom and a spiritualist, such as dutiful strike, and she treats her rogue level as both her spiritualist level and her phantom Hit Dice when determining abilities and save DCs.</p>
			<p>Once per round when a dreamthief makes a melee attack, she can declare that attack to be a dreamstrike. This does not require an action, but a dreamthief must declare a dreamstrike before making the attack roll. A dreamstrike is treated as a slam attack for the purpose of emotional focus abilities that apply to a phantom&#146;s slam attacks, such as miserable strike. At 20th level, any melee attack a dreamthief makes automatically gains this benefit.</p>
			<p>This replaces sneak attack and master strike.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>A rogue adds 1/2 her level on Perception checks to locate traps and on Disable Device checks (minimum +1). A rogue can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Lucid Dreamer (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a dreamthief can control her dreams, and gains Lucid Dreamer as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p>This replaces trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Soothe Dreaming (Su): </b>At 4th level, a dreamthief can steal negative emotions, freeing allies from harmful conditions. This acts as the mesmerist&#146;s touch treatment ability, treating her rogue level as her mesmerist level; a dreamthief can use this ability once per day for every 3 rogue levels she has.</p>
			<p>This replaces uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Dream Infiltrator (Sp): </b>A dreamthief can enter dreams, whether to learn secrets or meddle more directly. At 8th level, a dreamthief can cast dream scan once per day as a spell-like ability. At 12th level, once per day she can cast either dream scan or dream travel as a spell-like ability. The caster level of these spell-like abilities is equal to her rogue level.</p>
			<p>This replaces improved uncanny dodge and the rogue talent gained at 12th level.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>

					<p>A discretion specialist is highly skilled at convincing others not to trust their own senses. At 3rd level as a full-round action, the discretion specialist can convince one living creature within 30 feet that up to 5 minutes of its memories from the past hour are unreliable. If the target fails a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half the discretion specialist&#146;s rogue level + her Intelligence modifier), the target is convinced that those memories didn&#146;t happen or that it&#146;s confusing the memories with a dream (or is otherwise hazy as to the memories&#146; reality). Each hour after the discretion specialist uses this ability, the target can attempt a new Will saving throw to realize that its relevant memories have been tampered with, although not necessarily that the discretion specialist was the originator of the tampering.</p>
					<p>The discretion specialist can use this ability once per day, and one additional time per day for every 5 rogue levels she has. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the discretion specialist can obfuscate memories from an additional hour in the past (to a maximum of 6 hours at 18th level).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Often brought in to handle messy situations, discretion specialists deal with bodies, inconvenient witnesses, and other loose ends. Many organizations employ them to cover up activities that might be unpopular&#151;should they become known to the general populace.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks.

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Fast Talker (Ex): </b>A discretion specialist adds half her rogue level (minimum +1) as a bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks.</p>
			<p>This replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Obfuscation (Su): </b>A discretion specialist is highly skilled at convincing others not to trust their own senses. At 3rd level as a full-round action, the discretion specialist can convince one living creature within 30 feet that up to 5 minutes of its memories from the past hour are unreliable. If the target fails a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half the discretion specialist&#146;s rogue level + her Intelligence modifier), the target is convinced that those memories didn&#146;t happen or that it&#146;s confusing the memories with a dream (or is otherwise hazy as to the memories&#146; reality). Each hour after the discretion specialist uses this ability, the target can attempt a new Will saving throw to realize that its relevant memories have been tampered with, although not necessarily that the discretion specialist was the originator of the tampering.</p>
			<p>The discretion specialist can use this ability once per day, and one additional time per day for every 5 rogue levels she has. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the discretion specialist can obfuscate memories from an additional hour in the past (to a maximum of 6 hours at 18th level).</p>
			<p>This replaces trap sense (for a core rogue) or danger sense (for an unchained rogue).</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Evidence Disposal (Sp): </b>A discretion specialist can cover up a corpse&#146;s cause of a death&#151;or dispose of it entirely. At 4th level, the discretion specialist gains the ability to cast dress corpse (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Intrigue 212) as a spell-like ability, using her rogue level as her caster level. She can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day for every 5 rogue levels she has (to a maximum of five times at 20th level).</p>
			<p>At 12th level, she can spend two uses of this ability to disintegrate a corpse entirely as a full-round action, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust (a disintegrated creature&#146;s equipment is unaffected). The target cannot be an undead creature. A corpse disintegrated this way cannot be brought back to life except by resurrection or more powerful magic, including miracle or wish.</p>
			<p>This replaces the rogue talents gained at 4th and 12th levels.</p>
			<p><b>No Loose Ends (Ex): </b>At 4th level, the discretion specialist can prevent opponents from escaping. Opponents damaged by the discretion specialist&#146;s sneak attack are unable to take the withdraw action for 1 round, though they can still move as normal.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, a creature damaged by the discretion specialist&#146;s sneak attack is hampered in casting spells of the teleportation subschool (such as dimension door) as well as using methods of magical transport such as shadow walk. A target attempting to cast such a spell before the end of the discretion specialist&#146;s next turn must succeed at a concentration check (in addition to any concentration checks required for casting while threatened or other circumstances) or lose the spell. The DC of this check is equal to 10 + half the discretion specialist&#146;s rogue level + her Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>This replaces uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Desert raiders constantly threaten caravans that cross vast, desolate expanses. Some desert raiders are tribespeople who raid to supplement their hardscrabble existence, while others are career thieves who take to the desert to avoid the noose. To survive, a desert raider must learn the secrets of the deserts and become inured to their dangers. Though most often associated with hot deserts, desert raiders can also operate in tundra, where sunlight on snow can blind as easily as on sand.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Desert Tracker (Ex): </b>A desert raider is immune to the dazzled condition. A desert raider adds half her level (minimum 1) as a bonus on Survival skill checks to follow or identify tracks in desert terrain.</p>
			<p>This replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Sun at Your Back (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a desert raider can use the reflected light of the blinding sun to conceal her presence. A desert raider in bright light can attempt Stealth checks without cover or concealment but takes a &#150;5 penalty on her check. The desert raider cannot use this ability to hide from creatures immune to the blinded or dazzled conditions. This replaces the rogue talent gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Light Step (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, the DC of Survival checks to track the desert raider increase by 3. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. The DC increase and the bonus on Perception checks increase by 1 every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum increase of 8 and a maximum bonus of +6 at 18th level).</p>
			<p>This replaces trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Skilled at manipulation and diversion, the deadly courtesan builds up those around her and periodically takes them down. She can be a spy, entertainer, assassin, bodyguard, or just an intimate to someone who needs it most. A deadly courtesan has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Race: </b>Vishkanya Only</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>8 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>A rogue adds 1/2 her level on Perception checks to locate traps and on Disable Device checks (minimum +1). A rogue can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Bardic Performance (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a deadly courtesan gains the bardic performance ability and the fascinate bardic performance. Her fascinate DC is 10 + 1/2 her rogue level + her Charisma modifier. She can use this bardic performance for a number of rounds per day equal to 1 + her Charisma modifier. At each level after 2nd, she can use bardic performance for 1 additional round per day. If the courtesan also has bard levels, she may use these rounds for either class&#146;s fascinate bardic performance, and her bard and rogue levels stack for determining her fascinate DC. This ability replaces the rogue trick gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Inspire Competence (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a deadly courtesan can use her bardic performance to inspire competence. The bonus begins at +2 and increases by +1 for every six levels the courtesan has attained beyond 3rd (+3 at 9th and +4 at 15th). This ability replaces all levels of trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Performance Strike (Sp): </b>At 8th level, as a swift action, a deadly courtesan may expend rounds of bardic performance to gain a morale bonus on one attack roll. The amount of the bonus is equal to the number of bardic performance rounds expended (maximum bonus equal to 1/2 her deadly courtesan level). This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue.

A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Everyone who lives in the city understands that a wealthy man stays wealthy by guarding his purse while wandering the streets and markets. Cutpurses are often trained by guilds to collect the guild&#146;s tax from local businesses on a daily basis, whether through intimidation or pickpocketing. Some find themselves taking up the mantle of adventurer, and their talents are generally appreciated in this role, but the cutpurse is still the first person her companions look to when an item goes missing.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Measure the Mark (Ex): </b>When a cutpurse makes a Sleight of Hand check to take something from a creature, the target makes its Perception check before the rogue makes her Sleight of Hand check, and the rogue knows the Perception check result. She can decide whether or not to make the check based on the results of the target&#146;s Perception check. If the rogue elects not to make the check, she can make a Bluff check, opposed by the target&#146;s Sense Motive, to prevent the target from noticing the attempt. This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Stab and Grab (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, as a full-round action, a cutpurse can make an attack and also make a Sleight of Hand check to steal something from the target of the attack. If the attack deals sneak attack damage, the rogue can use Sleight of Hand to take an item from the creature during combat; otherwise this ability can only be used in a surprise round before the target has acted. If the attack is successful, the target takes a &#150;5 penalty on the Perception check to notice the theft. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

				<name type="string">Debilitating Injury</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Charlatans and stage magicians use slight of hand to fake magic. A counterfeit mage goes a step further, parroting the motions and activation phrases used by arcane casters to activate wands or other magical accoutrements. While counterfeit mages rarely fool a real wizard, their command of the arcane is enough to convince most lay people.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Magical Expertise (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a counterfeit mage adds 1/2 his level to Disable Device checks to disarm magical traps, Perception checks to find magical traps, and Use Magic Device checks to activate scrolls and wands. A counterfeit mage can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps. This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Danger Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a rogue gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability counts as trap sense for the purpose of any feat or class prerequisite, and can be replaced by any archetype class feature that replaces trap sense. The bonuses gained from this ability stack with those gained from trap sense (from another class).</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Signature Wand (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a counterfeit mage can spend 1 hour practicing with a wand to designate it as his signature wand. He can draw that wand as a free action, and can activate it without having to succeed at a Use Magic Device check. He can change his signature wand once per day. This ability replaces the rogue talent gained at 4th level.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Wand Adept (Ex): </b>At 6th level, a counterfeit mage can use his Dexterity modifier in place of his Charisma modifier when attempting Use Magic Device checks to activate wands.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>

					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The construct saboteur harnesses arcane energy to combat the golems and eldritch guardians that prowl the depths of ancient ruins and forgotten tombs.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p>Arcane Strike (Ex): A construct saboteur gains Arcane Strike as a bonus feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites. She uses her construct saboteur class level in place of her caster level for the purposes of the feat&#146;s effects.</p>
			<p>This replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Arcane Sabotage (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a construct saboteur can user her arcane prowess to hinder constructs. Whenever she uses Arcane Strike to attack a construct, she can activate one of the following sabotage abilities that she has gained. She gains one sabotage ability at 2nd level and can thereafter select any sabotage ability in place of a rogue talent. The DC for any sabotage ability that requires a saving throw is 10 + half the construct saboteur&#146;s level + the construct saboteur&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p><i>Diminish Senses: </i>A jolt of energy overwhelms the construct&#146;s senses. The construct is blinded for 1 round. A construct saboteur can forgo dealing sneak attack damage to extend the duration of the blindness by 1 round for every 2d6 points of sneak attack damage forgone in this way. A construct can negate this effect with a successful Will save.</p>
			<p><i>Magic Vulnerability: </i>A field of energy enshrouds the construct, disabling its immunity to magic for 1 round. The construct instead gains spell resistance equal to 15 + its CR. A construct saboteur can forgo dealing sneak attack damage to reduce this spell resistance. The construct&#146;s spell resistance is reduced by 1 for every 1d6 points of sneak attack damage forgone in this way. A construct can negate this effect with a successful Will save.</p>
			<p><i>Overwhelming Jolt: </i>A sudden burst of power moves over the surface of the construct, giving it the staggered condition for 1 round. A construct can negate this effect with a successful Will save.</p>
			<p><i>Slowing Pulse: </i>A surge of slowing energy ripples through the construct, reducing its speed by 5 feet for a number of rounds equal to the construct saboteur&#146;s Intelligence modifier. A construct saboteur can forgo dealing sneak attack damage to reduce the construct&#146;s speed by an additional 5 feet for every 1d6 points of sneak attack damage forgone in this way. This ability cannot lower a construct&#146;s movement speed below 5 feet. A construct can reduce the duration of this effect to 1 round with a successful Reflex save.</p>
			<p>This replaces the rogue talent gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Dismantling Strikes (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a construct saboteur ignores the first 2 points of DR or hardness when attacking constructs. This value increases by 2 every 3 levels after 3rd, to a total of 12 points of DR or hardness ignored at level 18.</p>
			<p>This replaces trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>

Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Dark lurkers use darkness as an ally. They are widely feared in many major metropolises, spoken of as &#147;living shadows&#148; by guards of Magnimar who patrol under the Irespan and called &#147;the hungry night&#148; by citizens of Absalom who mistake them for fetchling assassins.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>A rogue adds 1/2 her level on Perception checks to locate traps and on Disable Device checks (minimum +1). A rogue can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Blades from the Shadows (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a dark lurker gains shadow strikeAPG as a bonus rogue talent. (A character using the unchained rogue class from Pathfinder RPG Pathfinder Unchained instead gains the ability to make attacks of opportunity against foes with cover, though not foes with improved cover or total cover). At 6th level, the dark lurker can deal precision damage to targets with total concealment (though any miss chance applies normally, and may prevent an attack from hitting in the first place).</p>
			<p>This ability replaces evasion; the dark lurker can take evasion as a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Blind-Fight (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a dark lurker gains Blind-Fight as a bonus feat. This ability replaces the rogue talent gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Danger Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a rogue gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability counts as trap sense for the purpose of any feat or class prerequisite, and can be replaced by any archetype class feature that replaces trap sense. The bonuses gained from this ability stack with those gained from trap sense (from another class).</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Blind-Fight (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a dark lurker gains Improved Blind-FightAPG as a bonus feat. This ability replaces the rogue talent gained at 8th level.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Blind-Fight (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a dark lurker gains Greater Blind-FightAPG as a bonus feat. This ability replaces the rogue talent gained at 14th level.</p>
			<p><b>Instinctual Sense (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a dark lurker gains blindsight with a range of 30 feet. This ability replaces the rogue talent gained at 20th level.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
					<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
					<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
					<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>

A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Consiglieres act as trusted mediators and administrators for crime families and various criminal organizations, and many serve as the right hand to the leaders of such groups. Other consiglieres prefer to work as independent operators and sell their advice and expertise to the highest bidder. Though some consiglieres insulate themselves from violence and criminal activities, many enjoy getting their hands dirty leading strike teams or gangs of hardened thugs.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Convincing Attitude (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a consigliere gains Persuasive as a bonus feat. At 2nd level, he gains the charmerAPG rogue talent (or the certainty [Diplomacy] rogue talent if he is an unchained rogue). At 3rd level, if a consigliere attempts a Diplomacy check and fails to influence a creature&#146;s attitude by 5 or more, the creature&#146;s attitude remains unchanged instead of decreasing by one step.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces trapfinding and evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feats (Ex): </b>Starting at 4th level, a consigliere can choose to gain a single teamwork feat instead of a single rogue talent. Starting at 12th level, the consigliere can choose to gain teamwork feats instead of rogue talents as many times as he chooses.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces all instances of trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Advisor (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a consigliere misses with a melee attack against an opponent, he can designate an ally within 30 feet of the target to receive a +1 insight bonus on her next attack roll against that opponent before the consigliere&#146;s next turn. At 8th level, the insight bonus increases to +2.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Field Boss (Ex): </b>At 10th level, as a standard action, a consigliere can grant a teamwork feat to all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear her. This teamwork feat must be one the consigliere knows. Allies retain the use of this feat for 3 rounds plus 1 round for every 2 rogue levels the consigliere has. Allies do not need to meet the prerequisites of this teamwork feat. The consigliere can use this ability once per day at 10th level, plus 1 additional time per day every 4 rogue levels thereafter.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the rogue talent normally gained at 10th level.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A charlatan is a master of lies and deception. Whether creating simple cons or elaborately woven hoaxes capable of swaying the masses and those in positions of power, a charlatan is often a purveyor of snake-oil, forgeries, and rumormongering.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Natural Born Liar (Ex): </b>At 1st level, when a charlatan successfully deceives a creature with a Bluff, that creature takes a &#173;&#150;2 penalty on the charlatan&#146;s Bluff checks for the next 24 hours. This ability does not stack with itself. This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Grand Hoax (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, the charlatan begins to master the art of the grand hoax and learns to create deceptions designed to bestow harm upon her foes. She gains the rumormonger advanced talent, even though she is not yet 10th level. This ability takes the place of trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

Every day she gains a pool of stealth points equal to her ranks in Bluff. These points refresh at the start of each day.

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue.

A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>An absolute master of disguise, a chameleon effortlessly blends into any environment. Whether disappearing into crowded city streets, vanishing into desert sands, or slipping into the darkness of subterranean tunnels, the chameleon relies upon her ability to become part of her surroundings.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Misdirection (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a chameleon begins her career knowing that the secret to disappearing lies in deceiving the senses of her observers. Every day she gains a pool of stealth points equal to her ranks in Bluff. These points refresh at the start of each day. Before making a Stealth check, she can choose to put stealth points into the roll, gaining a bonus on Stealth checks equal to the number of stealth points she puts into the roll. If she gains a bonus on Bluff checks because of a feat (such as Skill Focus [Bluff]), she adds a number of points to her stealth pool equal to the bonus the feat grants. This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Effortless Sneak (Sp): </b>At 3rd level, the chameleon chooses a single terrain from the ranger&#146;s favored terrain class feature. While she is within that terrain, she can take 10 on any Stealth check she can make within that terrain. When the chameleon reaches 6th level, and every three levels thereafter, she chooses a new type of terrain from the ranger&#146;s favored terrain list. She gains this ability with the newly picked terrain. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Gifted with finesse and stealth, catfolk make excellent burglars. Cat burglars are masters of breaking and entering, using their feline grace to make it seem as though no crime was ever committed in the first place. Few locks can withstand skilled cat burglars, and such nimble rogues are capable of bypassing traps without activating them and enabling associates to do the same. A cat burglar has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Race: </b>Catfolk Only</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>A rogue adds 1/2 her level on Perception checks to locate traps and on Disable Device checks (minimum +1). A rogue can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Danger Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a rogue gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability counts as trap sense for the purpose of any feat or class prerequisite, and can be replaced by any archetype class feature that replaces trap sense. The bonuses gained from this ability stack with those gained from trap sense (from another class).</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Trap Saboteur (Su): </b>At 8th level, a cat burglar becomes a master of avoiding and manipulating traps and locks. She can attempt to open a lock as a standard action and takes 1/2 the normal amount of time to disable traps (minimum 1 round) . When she has bypassed a trap without disarming it, she can also choose to suppress its trigger for up to 1 minute. If she does, she can also choose to end this suppression prematurely as a free action. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue.

A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Carnivalists train their miniature minions to perform acts of larceny and often hide their true talents behind theatrical sideshows.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar: </b>At 1st level, a carnivalist gains a familiar as a wizard of equal level. Levels in a class that grants a familiar stack with carnivalist levels for determining the familiar&#146;s abilities.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>A rogue adds 1/2 her level on Perception checks to locate traps and on Disable Device checks (minimum +1). A rogue can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Pet Performance (Ex): </b>A carnivalist gains use of several bardic performances, making Handle Animal checks in place of any Perform checks. At 2nd level, she gains the distraction bardic performance. At 4th level, she gains the fascinate bardic performance. At 6th level, she also gains use of the following performance.</p>
			<p><i>Trained Legerdemain (Ex): </i>At 6th level, a carnivalist can command a familiar or pet within 30 feet to make a Disable Device or Sleight of Hand check as if trained in the skill, using its own skill ranks (if any), Dexterity modifier, and equipment, with a competence bonus equal to 1/2 her rogue level. The check requires the normal amount of time to complete and the DC increases by 5. The carnivalist must maintain this pet performance each round her familiar or pet attempts a Disable Device or Sleight of Hand check.</p>
			<p>The pet performance ability otherwise functions identically to bardic performance. Levels in a class with the distraction or fascinate bardic performances stack with carnivalist levels for the purpose of determining bonuses granted by these performances. This ability replaces the rogue talents gained at 2nd, 4th, and 6th level.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p>A carnivalist gains this ability starting at 2nd level. The sneak attack damage dealt is 1d6 points at 2nd level, and increases by 1d6 points every 4 carnivalist levels thereafter. A carnivalist&#146;s familiar can also deal sneak attack damage as appropriate to foes as long as it is within 30 feet of her (though only Small and larger creatures may flank enemies, as usual).</p>
			<p><b>Animal Trainer (Ex): </b>Starting at 3rd level, a carnivalist receives a bonus equal to 1/2 her rogue level whenever she uses Handle Animal on a Tiny or Small animal. In addition, she can increase the DC by 5 to reduce the time needed to teach an animal a new trick or train an animal for a general purpose to 1 day for every week normally required. She can also train more than one animal at once, although each animal after the first adds 2 to the DC. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 8th level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 8th level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Adept at infiltration, trap removal, and lock picking, burglars prey on the homes of the wealthy and forgotten tombs alike. Such riches are guarded with vicious traps and hazards, but the devious mind of the burglar allows her to find such dangers and avoid them.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>A rogue adds 1/2 her level on Perception checks to locate traps and on Disable Device checks (minimum +1). A rogue can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Danger Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a rogue gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability counts as trap sense for the purpose of any feat or class prerequisite, and can be replaced by any archetype class feature that replaces trap sense. The bonuses gained from this ability stack with those gained from trap sense (from another class).</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Careful Disarm (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a burglar attempts to disarm a trap using Disable Device, she does not spring the trap unless she fails by 10 or more. If she does set off a trap she was attempting to disarm, she adds double her trap sense bonus to avoid the trap. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Distraction (Ex): </b>At 8th level, whenever a burglar is detected while using Stealth, she can immediately attempt a Bluff skill check opposed by the Sense Motive skill of the creature that spotted her. If this check succeeds, the target assumes that the noise was something innocent and disregards the detection. This only functions if the creature cannot see the rogue. This ability can only be used once during a given Stealth attempt. If the same creature detects the rogue&#146;s presence again, the ability has no effect. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>

A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends.

					<p>At 8th level, if a Bellflower irrigator studies his target for 3 rounds (spending a standard action each round to do so) and then makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon that successfully deals damage, the attack has the additional effect of possibly either paralyzing or killing the target (Bellflower irrigator&#146;s choice). The death attack fails if the target detects the Bellflower irrigator or recognizes him as an enemy. If the victim of the attack fails a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the Bellflower irrigator&#146;s class level + the Bellflower irrigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier) against the kill effect, she dies. If the saving throw fails against the paralysis effect, the victim is rendered helpless and unable to act for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per 2 rogue levels that the Bellflower irrigator has. If the victim&#146;s saving throw succeeds, the attack is just a normal sneak attack. Once the Bellflower irrigator has completed the 3 rounds of study, he must make the irrigation attempt within the next 3 rounds. A Bellflower irrigator can attempt to kill or paralyze a creature in this way once per day, plus one additional time per day for every 4 additional rogue levels he has after 8th.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Bellflower irrigators take on tasks that many other agents of the Bellflower Network find distasteful. Rather than focusing on saving slaves, Bellflower irrigators seek to defeat slavery by aiming to eliminate the source. They gauge the precise moment to strike from the shadows and annihilate slave traders and masters alike. Bellflower irrigators realize that for every slave released today, another will be shackled tomorrow&#151;until all the masters are dead. This cynicism leads Bellflower irrigators to target anyone who owns or sells slaves on Golarion, especially cruel masters within Cheliax.</i></p>
			<p><i>Though most Bellflower irrigators are halflings, this branch of the Network is more diverse than many of the others&#151;anyone with a hatred of slavery and a talent for stealth and martial combat is free to join. Bellflower irrigators employ combat methods that many find questionable, such as the use of poison and calculated strikes meant to kill rather than incapacitate. The Bellflower Network does not knowingly allow evil members, but very few Bellflower irrigators are good&#151;most are chaotic neutral in alignment, as their methods of solving the problem of slavery often force them into moral and ethical gray areas. A few Bellflower irrigators are in fact evil, but these rarities do their best to hide their personal lack of morals and addiction to cruelty in order to maintain their positions and connection to the Bellflowers, for as evil as they may be, they share a hatred of slavery with their more altruistic kin. An evil Bellflower irrigator who is found out is typically exiled from the group, yet most continue to fight slavery even after they are sent away in this way.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>8 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Bellflower Crop (Ex): </b>As a standard action, a Bellflower irrigator can designate a number of allies equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier as part of his Bellflower crop. Members of a Bellflower crop must remain within 30 feet of the Bellflower irrigator to gain any benefits from abilities that affect a Bellflower crop, regardless of the ability&#146;s source (whether it&#146;s a Bellflower harvester, irrigator, or tiller). If the allies leave this range, the Bellflower irrigator must designate them again to include them in his crop.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Use (Ex): </b>A Bellflower irrigator is trained in the use of poison and cannot accidentally poison himself when applying poison to a weapon.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Danger Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a rogue gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability counts as trap sense for the purpose of any feat or class prerequisite, and can be replaced by any archetype class feature that replaces trap sense. The bonuses gained from this ability stack with those gained from trap sense (from another class).</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Grafting (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a Bellflower irrigator is considered to be flanking an opponent if at least two members of his Bellflower crop are threatening that opponent, regardless of the irrigator&#146;s actual positioning.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces uncanny dodge and the rogue talent gained at 4th level.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Irrigation (Ex): </b>At 8th level, if a Bellflower irrigator studies his target for 3 rounds (spending a standard action each round to do so) and then makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon that successfully deals damage, the attack has the additional effect of possibly either paralyzing or killing the target (Bellflower irrigator&#146;s choice). The death attack fails if the target detects the Bellflower irrigator or recognizes him as an enemy. If the victim of the attack fails a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the Bellflower irrigator&#146;s class level + the Bellflower irrigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier) against the kill effect, she dies. If the saving throw fails against the paralysis effect, the victim is rendered helpless and unable to act for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per 2 rogue levels that the Bellflower irrigator has. If the victim&#146;s saving throw succeeds, the attack is just a normal sneak attack. Once the Bellflower irrigator has completed the 3 rounds of study, he must make the irrigation attempt within the next 3 rounds. A Bellflower irrigator can attempt to kill or paralyze a creature in this way once per day, plus one additional time per day for every 4 additional rogue levels he has after 8th.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>One of the many ethnicities found in the Mwangi Expanse, the Bekyar people are slavers and demon worshipers. A Bekyar kidnapper is not only adept at hiding herself in thick jungles and quickly subduing her prey, but also at spreading rumors of hidden ruins, buried treasure, and other such valuables that might lure an unwary foreigner into her traps.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Clean Capture (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a Bekyar kidnapper reduces the penalty to her combat maneuver check to tie up a pinned or otherwise restrained target by an amount equal to 1/2 her rogue level. In addition, she can take the feats Improved Grapple and Greater Grapple as rogue talents. She can ignore the Improved Unarmed Strike requirement when selecting these feats as rogue talents, but must meet all other prerequisites. This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Abductor (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a Bekyar kidnapper gains a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks to grapple a foe. In addition, the Bekyar kidnapper treats her combat maneuver bonus as 1 higher when a foe tries to grapple her or when a grappled target attempts to break free of her grapple. These bonuses increase by 1 for every 3 levels beyond 3rd. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
					<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Bandits, brigands, and highwaymen hone their craft along the roadsides and byways of the world, where they leap from the shadows to plunder the spoils of passing travelers. Bandits tend to have a variety of skills; sometimes these skills are similar to a ranger&#146;s, but a bandit&#146;s tactics always deal with surprise followed by intimidation, with the clear threat of naked force if intimidation does not do the trick. But not all bandits are ruthless thugs. There are those who become outlaws in opposition to tyrants or similar oppressors. These bandits target the status quo and distribute their spoils back into the needy hands of the peasantry.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>A rogue adds 1/2 her level on Perception checks to locate traps and on Disable Device checks (minimum +1). A rogue can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Danger Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a rogue gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability counts as trap sense for the purpose of any feat or class prerequisite, and can be replaced by any archetype class feature that replaces trap sense. The bonuses gained from this ability stack with those gained from trap sense (from another class).</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Ambush (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a bandit becomes fully practiced in the art of ambushing. When she acts in the surprise round, she can take a move action, standard action, and swift action during the surprise round, not just a move or standard action. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Fearsome Strike (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a bandit can terrify an opponent with a single hit. A number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1), when a bandit confirms a critical hit and deals sneak attack damage to an opponent, she can choose to make the opponent frightened for a number of rounds equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). She cannot use this ability in conjunction with a critical feat. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
					<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
					<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue.

A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Agility and daring are both excellent rogue traits, and their confluence can create spectacular feats of acrobatics. Whether they are daring thieves, infiltrating assassins, or intrepid spies, proper training in acrobatics is a valuable boon for rogues.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat&#151;all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the Core Rulebook, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue&#146;s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Rogue (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>8 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Expert Acrobat (Ex): </b>At 1st level, an acrobat does not suffer any armor check penalties on Acrobatics, Climb, Fly, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth skill checks while wearing light armor. When she is not wearing armor, she gains a +2 competency bonus on Acrobatics and Fly skill checks. This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The rogue&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack&#151;not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Finesse Training (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a rogue gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Second Chance (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, an acrobat can reroll any Acrobatics, Climb, or Fly skill check she has just made. This reroll is made at a &#150;5 penalty. She must take the second result, even if it is worse. An acrobat can use this ability only once on any given skill check. She can use this ability once per day at 3rd level, plus one additional time per day for every 3 levels beyond 3rd. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Injury (Ex): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rogue deals sneak attack damage to a foe, she can also debilitate the target of her attack, causing it to take a penalty for 1 round (this is in addition to any penalty caused by a rogue talent or other special ability). The rogue can choose to apply any one of the following penalties when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p><i>Bewildered: </i>The target becomes bewildered, taking a &#150;2 penalty to AC. The target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty to AC against all attacks made by the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty to AC against attacks made by the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Disoriented: </i>The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition, the target takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls it makes against the rogue. At 10th level and 16th level, the penalty on attack rolls made against the rogue increases by &#150;2 (to a total maximum of &#150;8).</p>
			<p><i>Hampered: </i>All of the target&#146;s speeds are reduced by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). In addition, the target cannot take a 5-foot step.</p>
			<p>These penalties do not stack with themselves, but additional attacks that deal sneak attack damage extend the duration by 1 round. A creature cannot suffer from more than one penalty from this ability at a time. If a new penalty is applied, the old penalty immediately ends. Any form of healing applied to a target suffering from one of these penalties also removes the penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue&#146;s Edge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skill&#146;s normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She gains the skill unlock powers (see page 82) for that skill as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked.</p>
			<p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Master Strike (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue&#146;s level + the rogue&#146;s Dexterity modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue&#146;s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.</p>
