					<p>A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the shaman spell list. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
					<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;9. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1&#150;3 in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>

					<p>A shaman forms a mystical bond with the spirits of the world. She forms a lasting bond with a single spirit (see Spirits on page 37), which grants a number of abilities and defines many of her other class features.</p>
					<p>At 1st level, a shaman gains the spirit ability granted by her chosen spirit. She adds the spells granted by that spirit to the list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She also adds the hexes possessed by that spirit to the list of hexes that she can use with the hex and wandering hex class features.</p>
					<p>At 8th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her selected spirit. At 16th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed for the true version of her selected spirit.</p>
					<p>If the shaman takes levels in another class that grants a mystery (such as the oracle), the spirit and mystery must match, even if that means one of them must change. Subject to GM discretion, the shaman can change her former mystery or spirit to make them conform.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a shaman forms a close bond with a spirit animal tied to her chosen spirit. This animal is her conduit to the spirit world, guiding her along the path to enlightenment. The animal also aids a shaman by granting her a special ability. See the Spirit Animal section on page 47.</p>
					<p>A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells. While the spirit animal does not store the spells like a witch&#146;s familiar does, the spirit animal serves as her conduit to divine power. If a shaman&#146;s spirit animal is slain, she cannot prepare new spells or use her spirit magic class feature until the spirit animal is replaced.</p>

					<p>A shaman can spontaneously cast a limited number of spells per day beyond those she prepared ahead of time. She has one spell slot per day of each shaman spell level she can cast, not including orisons. She can choose these spells from the list of spells granted by her spirits (see the spirit class feature and the wandering spirit class feature) at the time she casts them. She can enhance these spells using any metamagic feat that she knows, using up a higher-level spell slot as required by the feat and increasing the time to cast the spell (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>-</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>While some heroes speak to gods or consort with otherworldly muses, shamans commune with the spirits of the world and the energies that exist in every living thing. These divine adventurers draw upon their power to shape the world and expand the inf luence of their spiritual patrons. Shamans have strong ties to natural spirits. They form powerful bonds with particular spirits, and as their power grows they learn to call upon other spirits in times of need.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Shamans make for potent divine spellcasters, capable of using divine spells and the power of their spirits to aid their allies and destroy their foes. While they aren&#146;t the healers that clerics are, they can still fill that role when needed.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p>P <b>arent Class(es): </b>Oracle and witch.</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>A shaman is proficient with all simple weapons, and with light and medium armor.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the shaman spell list. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;9. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1&#150;3 in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Shamans can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;9. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit (Su): </b>A shaman forms a mystical bond with the spirits of the world. She forms a lasting bond with a single spirit (see Spirits on page 37), which grants a number of abilities and defines many of her other class features.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a shaman gains the spirit ability granted by her chosen spirit. She adds the spells granted by that spirit to the list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She also adds the hexes possessed by that spirit to the list of hexes that she can use with the hex and wandering hex class features.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her selected spirit. At 16th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed for the true version of her selected spirit.</p>
			<p>If the shaman takes levels in another class that grants a mystery (such as the oracle), the spirit and mystery must match, even if that means one of them must change. Subject to GM discretion, the shaman can change her former mystery or spirit to make them conform.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman forms a close bond with a spirit animal tied to her chosen spirit. This animal is her conduit to the spirit world, guiding her along the path to enlightenment. The animal also aids a shaman by granting her a special ability. See the Spirit Animal section on page 47.</p>
			<p>A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells. While the spirit animal does not store the spells like a witch&#146;s familiar does, the spirit animal serves as her conduit to divine power. If a shaman&#146;s spirit animal is slain, she cannot prepare new spells or use her spirit magic class feature until the spirit animal is replaced.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Magic: </b>A shaman can spontaneously cast a limited number of spells per day beyond those she prepared ahead of time. She has one spell slot per day of each shaman spell level she can cast, not including orisons. She can choose these spells from the list of spells granted by her spirits (see the spirit class feature and the wandering spirit class feature) at the time she casts them. She can enhance these spells using any metamagic feat that she knows, using up a higher-level spell slot as required by the feat and increasing the time to cast the spell (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a shaman learns one hex. At 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.</p>
			<p>Using a hex is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Spirit (Su): </b>At 4th level, a shaman can form a temporary bond with a spirit other than the one selected using her spirit class feature. She must make this selection each day when preparing her spells. While this feature is active, she gains the spirit ability granted by the spirit. She also adds the spells granted by that spirit to her list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She does not add the hexes from her wandering spirit to her list of hexes that she can choose from with the hex class feature. At 12th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit. At 20th level, she gains the ability listed in the true version of her wandering spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Hex: </b>At 6th level, a shaman can temporarily gain the use of one of the hexes possessed by either one of her spirits. She must make this selection each day when she prepares her spells. For the purposes of this ability, she can select any hex possessed by her spirit or wandering spirit. If she selects it from her wandering spirit, she loses the hex immediately if she bonds with another spirit, although she can then select a different hex to gain using this ability, from either her spirit or her new wandering spirit. At 14th level, a shaman can select two wandering hexes each day instead of one. This ability otherwise functions as the hex class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Manifestation (Su): </b>Upon reaching 20th level, a shaman undergoes a transformation as she manifests as a pinnacle of her main spirit. The nature of this manifestation depends on the shaman&#146;s spirit, and is described in its entry.</p>
			<h>Spirit Animal</h>
			<p>By communing with the incredible powers of her spirit, the shaman forges a cherished bond with one specif ic servant of that spirit&#151;known as a spirit animal. A spirit animal is a creature chosen by a shaman to serve as a conduit, allowing her to more fully access the magic of her spirit on a daily basis. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal also grants her special powers. This ability uses the same rules as the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature and is treated as a familiar (see pages 78 and 82 of the Core Rulebook), except as noted below.</p>
			<p>A shaman uses her level as her effective wizard level when determining the abilities of her spirit animal. A shaman can select any familiar available to wizards to serve as her spirit animal, although her spirit animal is augmented by the power of her chosen spirit. Once selected, the spirit animal cannot be changed. Although a shaman&#146;s spirit animal uses the statistics of a specific animal, it is treated as an outsider with the native subtype for the purposes of spells and abilities that affect it.</p>
			<p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack with shaman levels for the purpose of determining any spirit animal abilities that depend on the shaman&#146;s level. If a shaman possesses such levels in other classes, her spirit animal always uses the shaman rules for spirit animals, not those used by familiars of other classes (such as witches, wizards, or sorcerers with the arcane bloodline). If the shaman has witch levels, her spirit animal also serves as the conduit to her patron and stores her witch spells. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal is treated as a familiar for the purposes of all spells, effects, and abilities that affect familiars.</p>
			<p>If a spirit animal is lost or dies, it can be replaced after 24 hours through a special ritual that consumes material components worth 500 gp per shaman level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. The new spirit animal must be of the same sort of creature as the previous one.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman&#146;s spirit animal gains specific abilities, depending upon the type of spirit selected by the shaman using her spirit class feature. These abilities affect the animal&#146;s appearance and grant it special abilities that can aid it in serving the shaman and the spirit it represents and is connected to. These abilities are described in the spirit animal section of each individual spirit description.</p>
			<p><b>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </b>If a shaman is 3rd level or higher, her spirit animal can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the shaman and the spirit animal are in contact at the time the shaman casts a touch spell, she can designate her animal as the &#147;toucher.&#148; The spirit animal can then deliver the touch spell just as the shaman would. If the shaman casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the shaman activates a hex, her spirit animal can be used to make the touch; she doesn&#146;t have to be in contact with the animal to use this ability with hexes.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The witch doctor is a healer who specializes in afflictions of the soul. Often misunderstood, she protects her tribe with healing powers, powerful defensive magic, and her own divine &#147;witchcraft.&#148;</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>While some heroes speak to gods or consort with otherworldly muses, shamans commune with the spirits of the world and the energies that exist in every living thing.

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>A shaman is proficient with all simple weapons, and with light and medium armor.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the shaman spell list. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;9. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1&#150;3 in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Shamans can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;9. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit (Su): </b>A shaman forms a mystical bond with the spirits of the world. She forms a lasting bond with a single spirit (see Spirits on page 37), which grants a number of abilities and defines many of her other class features.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a shaman gains the spirit ability granted by her chosen spirit. She adds the spells granted by that spirit to the list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She also adds the hexes possessed by that spirit to the list of hexes that she can use with the hex and wandering hex class features.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her selected spirit. At 16th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed for the true version of her selected spirit.</p>
			<p>If the shaman takes levels in another class that grants a mystery (such as the oracle), the spirit and mystery must match, even if that means one of them must change. Subject to GM discretion, the shaman can change her former mystery or spirit to make them conform.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman forms a close bond with a spirit animal tied to her chosen spirit. This animal is her conduit to the spirit world, guiding her along the path to enlightenment. The animal also aids a shaman by granting her a special ability. See the Spirit Animal section on page 47.</p>
			<p>A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells. While the spirit animal does not store the spells like a witch&#146;s familiar does, the spirit animal serves as her conduit to divine power. If a shaman&#146;s spirit animal is slain, she cannot prepare new spells or use her spirit magic class feature until the spirit animal is replaced.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Magic: </b>A shaman can spontaneously cast a limited number of spells per day beyond those she prepared ahead of time. She has one spell slot per day of each shaman spell level she can cast, not including orisons. She can choose these spells from the list of spells granted by her spirits (see the spirit class feature and the wandering spirit class feature) at the time she casts them. She can enhance these spells using any metamagic feat that she knows, using up a higher-level spell slot as required by the feat and increasing the time to cast the spell (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a shaman learns one hex. At 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.</p>
			<p>Using a hex is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Channel Energy (Su): </b>At 4th level, the witch doctor can draw transcendental energies to her location, flooding it with positive energy as the cleric class feature. The witch doctor uses her shaman level &#150; 3 as her effective cleric level, and can channel energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. This is a separate pool of channel energy that does not stack with the life spirit's channel spirit ability. This ability replaces the hexes gained at 4th and 12th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Spirit (Su): </b>At 4th level, a shaman can form a temporary bond with a spirit other than the one selected using her spirit class feature. She must make this selection each day when preparing her spells. While this feature is active, she gains the spirit ability granted by the spirit. She also adds the spells granted by that spirit to her list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She does not add the hexes from her wandering spirit to her list of hexes that she can choose from with the hex class feature. At 12th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit. At 20th level, she gains the ability listed in the true version of her wandering spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Hex: </b>At 6th level, a shaman can temporarily gain the use of one of the hexes possessed by either one of her spirits. She must make this selection each day when she prepares her spells. For the purposes of this ability, she can select any hex possessed by her spirit or wandering spirit. If she selects it from her wandering spirit, she loses the hex immediately if she bonds with another spirit, although she can then select a different hex to gain using this ability, from either her spirit or her new wandering spirit. At 14th level, a shaman can select two wandering hexes each day instead of one. This ability otherwise functions as the hex class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Counter Curse (Su): </b>At 8th level, the witch doctor can choose to lose any prepared spirit magic spell that is 3rd level or higher in order to spontaneously cast dispel magic or remove curse. This ability can only target a spell effect that is on an ally (including herself ). If she forfeits a spirit magic spell higher than 3rd level, she gains a +2 sacred bonus on her caster level check to dispel the spell or to remove the curse for every spell level higher than 3rd that she sacrifices. This ability replaces the hex gained at 8th level.</p>
			<p><b>Countering Hex (Su): </b>At 10th level, the witch doctor can use her hex magic to counterspell as a readied action as dispel magic instead. She must succeed at a dispel check (1d20 + her shaman level) with a DC equal to 11 + the spell&#146;s caster level. If countering hex succeeds, the spell fizzles away and is lost. Failure means the spell is not countered. In either case, the witch doctor cannot attempt to use this hex against any of that caster&#146;s spells again for 24 hours. The witch doctor cannot use countering hex on an ongoing effect, a magic item, or a hex. This ability replaces the hex gained at 10th level.</p>
			<p><b>Manifestation (Su): </b>Upon reaching 20th level, a shaman undergoes a transformation as she manifests as a pinnacle of her main spirit. The nature of this manifestation depends on the shaman&#146;s spirit, and is described in its entry.</p>
			<h>Spirit Animal</h>
			<p>By communing with the incredible powers of her spirit, the shaman forges a cherished bond with one specif ic servant of that spirit&#151;known as a spirit animal. A spirit animal is a creature chosen by a shaman to serve as a conduit, allowing her to more fully access the magic of her spirit on a daily basis. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal also grants her special powers. This ability uses the same rules as the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature and is treated as a familiar (see pages 78 and 82 of the Core Rulebook), except as noted below.</p>
			<p>A shaman uses her level as her effective wizard level when determining the abilities of her spirit animal. A shaman can select any familiar available to wizards to serve as her spirit animal, although her spirit animal is augmented by the power of her chosen spirit. Once selected, the spirit animal cannot be changed. Although a shaman&#146;s spirit animal uses the statistics of a specific animal, it is treated as an outsider with the native subtype for the purposes of spells and abilities that affect it.</p>
			<p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack with shaman levels for the purpose of determining any spirit animal abilities that depend on the shaman&#146;s level. If a shaman possesses such levels in other classes, her spirit animal always uses the shaman rules for spirit animals, not those used by familiars of other classes (such as witches, wizards, or sorcerers with the arcane bloodline). If the shaman has witch levels, her spirit animal also serves as the conduit to her patron and stores her witch spells. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal is treated as a familiar for the purposes of all spells, effects, and abilities that affect familiars.</p>
			<p>If a spirit animal is lost or dies, it can be replaced after 24 hours through a special ritual that consumes material components worth 500 gp per shaman level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. The new spirit animal must be of the same sort of creature as the previous one.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman&#146;s spirit animal gains specific abilities, depending upon the type of spirit selected by the shaman using her spirit class feature. These abilities affect the animal&#146;s appearance and grant it special abilities that can aid it in serving the shaman and the spirit it represents and is connected to. These abilities are described in the spirit animal section of each individual spirit description.</p>
			<p><b>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </b>If a shaman is 3rd level or higher, her spirit animal can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the shaman and the spirit animal are in contact at the time the shaman casts a touch spell, she can designate her animal as the &#147;toucher.&#148; The spirit animal can then deliver the touch spell just as the shaman would. If the shaman casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the shaman activates a hex, her spirit animal can be used to make the touch; she doesn&#146;t have to be in contact with the animal to use this ability with hexes.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The visionary is a master at divination, drawing upon her intimate relationship with the spirit world to ferret out all manner of secrets and insights about the world around her and beyond.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>While some heroes speak to gods or consort with otherworldly muses, shamans commune with the spirits of the world and the energies that exist in every living thing. These divine adventurers draw upon their power to shape the world and expand the inf luence of their spiritual patrons. Shamans have strong ties to natural spirits. They form powerful bonds with particular spirits, and as their power grows they learn to call upon other spirits in times of need.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Shamans make for potent divine spellcasters, capable of using divine spells and the power of their spirits to aid their allies and destroy their foes. While they aren&#146;t the healers that clerics are, they can still fill that role when needed.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p>P <b>arent Class(es): </b>Oracle and witch.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shaman's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), and Survival (Wis).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>A shaman is proficient with all simple weapons, and with light and medium armor.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the shaman spell list. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;9. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1&#150;3 in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Shamans can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;9. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit (Su): </b>A shaman forms a mystical bond with the spirits of the world. She forms a lasting bond with a single spirit (see Spirits on page 37), which grants a number of abilities and defines many of her other class features.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a shaman gains the spirit ability granted by her chosen spirit. She adds the spells granted by that spirit to the list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She also adds the hexes possessed by that spirit to the list of hexes that she can use with the hex and wandering hex class features.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her selected spirit. At 16th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed for the true version of her selected spirit.</p>
			<p>If the shaman takes levels in another class that grants a mystery (such as the oracle), the spirit and mystery must match, even if that means one of them must change. Subject to GM discretion, the shaman can change her former mystery or spirit to make them conform.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman forms a close bond with a spirit animal tied to her chosen spirit. This animal is her conduit to the spirit world, guiding her along the path to enlightenment. The animal also aids a shaman by granting her a special ability. See the Spirit Animal section on page 47.</p>
			<p>A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells. While the spirit animal does not store the spells like a witch&#146;s familiar does, the spirit animal serves as her conduit to divine power. If a shaman&#146;s spirit animal is slain, she cannot prepare new spells or use her spirit magic class feature until the spirit animal is replaced.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Magic: </b>A shaman can spontaneously cast a limited number of spells per day beyond those she prepared ahead of time. She has one spell slot per day of each shaman spell level she can cast, not including orisons. She can choose these spells from the list of spells granted by her spirits (see the spirit class feature and the wandering spirit class feature) at the time she casts them. She can enhance these spells using any metamagic feat that she knows, using up a higher-level spell slot as required by the feat and increasing the time to cast the spell (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a shaman learns one hex. At 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.</p>
			<p>Using a hex is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat: </b>At 4th level, the visionary gains Diviner&#146;s DelvingAPG as a bonus feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites.</p>
			<p><b>Discern Magical Expertise (Ex): </b>At 4th level, the shaman can determine what type of spellcasting expertise a creature possesses by studying the creature for 2 rounds with detect magic or any of the following spells: detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, or detect law (if the creature belongs to the alignment). This ability tells the visionary what bloodlines, domains, hexes, schools, or mysteries (if any) the creature possesses. A successful Will saving throw negates this effect (DC = 10 + 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier). A creature affected by this ability cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours. This ability functions through magical sensors as with clairaudience/clairvoyance and scrying. This ability replaces wandering spirit gained at 4th level.</p>
			<p><b>Vision Spirit Magic: </b>At 4th level, the visionary adds the following spells to the list of spells she can cast using spirit magic: see alignmentUC (1st), see invisibility (2nd), clairaudience/clairvoyance (3rd), detect scrying (4th), prying eyes (5th), legend lore (6th), vision (7th), moment of prescience (8th), foresight (9th). This ability replaces the spirit magic spells gained from the shaman&#146;s wandering spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Divination (Su): </b>At 6th level, the visionary becomes more adept at divination magic. When she casts the augury spell, her chance for an accurate answer is automatically the maximum of 90%. Likewise, when she casts divination, she has the maximum 90% chance of an accurate answer.</p>
			<p>Finally, the visionary can prepare scrying as a 4th-level spell, and it requires only 1 minute to cast. The visionary also has a 10% chance per caster level to cast the spells listed in the scrying spell description, instead of 5% per caster level (to a maximum of 100%).</p>
			<p>The visionary must still prepare these spells to receive these benefits. This ability replaces the wandering hex gained at 6th level.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Spirit (Su): </b>At 12th level, the visionary forms a temporary bond with another spirit (other than the one she selected using her spirit class feature). This is identical to the 4th-level shaman class feature. This adds the wandering spirit magic spells to the list of spells she can cast using spirit magic, along with vision spirit magic and her original spirit. At 20th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit. This ability replaces the greater version of wandering spirit gained at 12th level and true version of wandering spirit gained at 20th level.</p>
			<p><b>Manifestation (Su): </b>Upon reaching 20th level, a shaman undergoes a transformation as she manifests as a pinnacle of her main spirit. The nature of this manifestation depends on the shaman&#146;s spirit, and is described in its entry.</p>
			<h>Spirit Animal</h>
			<p>By communing with the incredible powers of her spirit, the shaman forges a cherished bond with one specif ic servant of that spirit&#151;known as a spirit animal. A spirit animal is a creature chosen by a shaman to serve as a conduit, allowing her to more fully access the magic of her spirit on a daily basis. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal also grants her special powers. This ability uses the same rules as the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature and is treated as a familiar (see pages 78 and 82 of the Core Rulebook), except as noted below.</p>
			<p>A shaman uses her level as her effective wizard level when determining the abilities of her spirit animal. A shaman can select any familiar available to wizards to serve as her spirit animal, although her spirit animal is augmented by the power of her chosen spirit. Once selected, the spirit animal cannot be changed. Although a shaman&#146;s spirit animal uses the statistics of a specific animal, it is treated as an outsider with the native subtype for the purposes of spells and abilities that affect it.</p>
			<p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack with shaman levels for the purpose of determining any spirit animal abilities that depend on the shaman&#146;s level. If a shaman possesses such levels in other classes, her spirit animal always uses the shaman rules for spirit animals, not those used by familiars of other classes (such as witches, wizards, or sorcerers with the arcane bloodline). If the shaman has witch levels, her spirit animal also serves as the conduit to her patron and stores her witch spells. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal is treated as a familiar for the purposes of all spells, effects, and abilities that affect familiars.</p>
			<p>If a spirit animal is lost or dies, it can be replaced after 24 hours through a special ritual that consumes material components worth 500 gp per shaman level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. The new spirit animal must be of the same sort of creature as the previous one.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman&#146;s spirit animal gains specific abilities, depending upon the type of spirit selected by the shaman using her spirit class feature. These abilities affect the animal&#146;s appearance and grant it special abilities that can aid it in serving the shaman and the spirit it represents and is connected to. These abilities are described in the spirit animal section of each individual spirit description.</p>
			<p><b>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </b>If a shaman is 3rd level or higher, her spirit animal can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the shaman and the spirit animal are in contact at the time the shaman casts a touch spell, she can designate her animal as the &#147;toucher.&#148; The spirit animal can then deliver the touch spell just as the shaman would. If the shaman casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the shaman activates a hex, her spirit animal can be used to make the touch; she doesn&#146;t have to be in contact with the animal to use this ability with hexes.</p>

					<p>A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the shaman spell list. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
					<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;9. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1&#150;3 in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>

					<p>At 1st level, the unsworn shaman also forms a temporary bond with a minor spirit each day, granting her access to a shaman or witch hex of her choosing, but not a major hex or a grand hex. She must make this selection each day when she prepares her spells for the day. Until she changes the minor spirit, she continues to have access to the shaman or witch hex. At 2nd level, she can instead select a hex from one of her wandering spirits selected for that day. If she selects a witch hex, she treats her shaman level as her witch level, and uses her Wisdom in place of her Intelligence for the purpose of that hex.</p>
					<p>She can make temporary bonds with two minor spirits (thus gaining two hexes) at 4th level, and with one additional minor spirit (and hex) every 4 levels thereafter. This ability replaces spirit and alters hex.</p>

					<p>A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells. While the spirit animal does not store the spells like a witch&#146;s familiar does, the spirit animal serves as her conduit to divine power. If a shaman&#146;s spirit animal is slain, she cannot prepare new spells or use her spirit magic class feature until the spirit animal is replaced.</p>

					<p>A shaman can spontaneously cast a limited number of spells per day beyond those she prepared ahead of time. She has one spell slot per day of each shaman spell level she can cast, not including orisons. She can choose these spells from the list of spells granted by her spirits (see the spirit class feature and the wandering spirit class feature) at the time she casts them. She can enhance these spells using any metamagic feat that she knows, using up a higher-level spell slot as required by the feat and increasing the time to cast the spell (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>An unsworn shaman never binds herself to one specific spirit, always making new deals as she deems necessary for the circumstances that she finds herself in. While this weakens the powers she can access from any one spirit, it gives her access to a broader overall range of abilities.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>While some heroes speak to gods or consort with otherworldly muses, shamans commune with the spirits of the world and the energies that exist in every living thing. These divine adventurers draw upon their power to shape the world and expand the inf luence of their spiritual patrons. Shamans have strong ties to natural spirits. They form powerful bonds with particular spirits, and as their power grows they learn to call upon other spirits in times of need.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Shamans make for potent divine spellcasters, capable of using divine spells and the power of their spirits to aid their allies and destroy their foes. While they aren&#146;t the healers that clerics are, they can still fill that role when needed.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p>P <b>arent Class(es): </b>Oracle and witch.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shaman's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), and Survival (Wis).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>A shaman is proficient with all simple weapons, and with light and medium armor.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the shaman spell list. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;9. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1&#150;3 in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>
			<p><b>Minor Spirit (Su): </b>At 1st level, the unsworn shaman also forms a temporary bond with a minor spirit each day, granting her access to a shaman or witch hex of her choosing, but not a major hex or a grand hex. She must make this selection each day when she prepares her spells for the day. Until she changes the minor spirit, she continues to have access to the shaman or witch hex. At 2nd level, she can instead select a hex from one of her wandering spirits selected for that day. If she selects a witch hex, she treats her shaman level as her witch level, and uses her Wisdom in place of her Intelligence for the purpose of that hex.</p>
			<p>She can make temporary bonds with two minor spirits (thus gaining two hexes) at 4th level, and with one additional minor spirit (and hex) every 4 levels thereafter. This ability replaces spirit and alters hex.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Shamans can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;9. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman forms a close bond with a spirit animal tied to her chosen spirit. This animal is her conduit to the spirit world, guiding her along the path to enlightenment. The animal also aids a shaman by granting her a special ability. See the Spirit Animal section on page 47.</p>
			<p>A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells. While the spirit animal does not store the spells like a witch&#146;s familiar does, the spirit animal serves as her conduit to divine power. If a shaman&#146;s spirit animal is slain, she cannot prepare new spells or use her spirit magic class feature until the spirit animal is replaced.</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a shaman learns one hex. At 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.</p>
			<p>Using a hex is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Magic: </b>The unsworn shaman gains this ability at 2nd level rather than at 1st. This ability alters spirit magic.A shaman can spontaneously cast a limited number of spells per day beyond those she prepared ahead of time. She has one spell slot per day of each shaman spell level she can cast, not including orisons. She can choose these spells from the list of spells granted by her spirits (see the spirit class feature and the wandering spirit class feature) at the time she casts them. She can enhance these spells using any metamagic feat that she knows, using up a higher-level spell slot as required by the feat and increasing the time to cast the spell (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal: </b>At 2nd level, an unsworn shaman&#146;s spirit animal gains the spirit animal bonus from one of her wandering spirits (see below). This bonus can be changed each day when the shaman prepares spells, but it must correspond to one of the shaman&#146;s wandering spirits. This ability alters spirit animal.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Spirit (Su): </b>At 2nd level, the unsworn shaman gains access to the wandering spirit class feature. At 10th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit. At 18th level, she gains the abilities listed in the true version of her wandering spirit.</p>
			<p>Additionally, at 6th level, she also gains a second wandering spirit, gaining the abilities listed in the greater version of that spirit at 14th level, and the abilities listed in the true version at 20th level. This ability alters wandering spirit and replaces wandering hex.</p>
			<p><b>Manifestation (Su): </b>Upon reaching 20th level, a shaman undergoes a transformation as she manifests as a pinnacle of her main spirit. The nature of this manifestation depends on the shaman&#146;s spirit, and is described in its entry.</p>
			<h>Spirit Animal</h>
			<p>By communing with the incredible powers of her spirit, the shaman forges a cherished bond with one specif ic servant of that spirit&#151;known as a spirit animal. A spirit animal is a creature chosen by a shaman to serve as a conduit, allowing her to more fully access the magic of her spirit on a daily basis. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal also grants her special powers. This ability uses the same rules as the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature and is treated as a familiar (see pages 78 and 82 of the Core Rulebook), except as noted below.</p>
			<p>A shaman uses her level as her effective wizard level when determining the abilities of her spirit animal. A shaman can select any familiar available to wizards to serve as her spirit animal, although her spirit animal is augmented by the power of her chosen spirit. Once selected, the spirit animal cannot be changed. Although a shaman&#146;s spirit animal uses the statistics of a specific animal, it is treated as an outsider with the native subtype for the purposes of spells and abilities that affect it.</p>
			<p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack with shaman levels for the purpose of determining any spirit animal abilities that depend on the shaman&#146;s level. If a shaman possesses such levels in other classes, her spirit animal always uses the shaman rules for spirit animals, not those used by familiars of other classes (such as witches, wizards, or sorcerers with the arcane bloodline). If the shaman has witch levels, her spirit animal also serves as the conduit to her patron and stores her witch spells. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal is treated as a familiar for the purposes of all spells, effects, and abilities that affect familiars.</p>
			<p>If a spirit animal is lost or dies, it can be replaced after 24 hours through a special ritual that consumes material components worth 500 gp per shaman level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. The new spirit animal must be of the same sort of creature as the previous one.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman&#146;s spirit animal gains specific abilities, depending upon the type of spirit selected by the shaman using her spirit class feature. These abilities affect the animal&#146;s appearance and grant it special abilities that can aid it in serving the shaman and the spirit it represents and is connected to. These abilities are described in the spirit animal section of each individual spirit description.</p>
			<p><b>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </b>If a shaman is 3rd level or higher, her spirit animal can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the shaman and the spirit animal are in contact at the time the shaman casts a touch spell, she can designate her animal as the &#147;toucher.&#148; The spirit animal can then deliver the touch spell just as the shaman would. If the shaman casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the shaman activates a hex, her spirit animal can be used to make the touch; she doesn&#146;t have to be in contact with the animal to use this ability with hexes.</p>

					<p>A true silvered throne&#146;s divine magic arises from communion with spirits alongside study of archaic lore compiled into a personal occult grimoire.

By studying his grimoire, a true silvered throne can prepare any spell on the shaman spell list or provided by his spirit. If this grimoire is lost or destroyed, he cannot prepare new spells or use his spirit magic class feature until it is replaced, which requires 1 week of work. This ability replaces spirit animal.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Members in good standing who have risen to a prestigious rank within the Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye, true silvered thrones have managed to discover rituals and occult secrets within the lore of their order. They are scholars of ancient mysteries and keepers of forbidden secrets who go beyond simply learning eldritch traditions to make the occult a part of their very souls.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>While some heroes speak to gods or consort with otherworldly muses, shamans commune with the spirits of the world and the energies that exist in every living thing. These divine adventurers draw upon their power to shape the world and expand the inf luence of their spiritual patrons. Shamans have strong ties to natural spirits. They form powerful bonds with particular spirits, and as their power grows they learn to call upon other spirits in times of need.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Shamans make for potent divine spellcasters, capable of using divine spells and the power of their spirits to aid their allies and destroy their foes. While they aren&#146;t the healers that clerics are, they can still fill that role when needed.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p>P <b>arent Class(es): </b>Oracle and witch.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shaman's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Fly (Dex), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>A shaman is proficient with all simple weapons, and with light and medium armor.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the shaman spell list. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;9. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1&#150;3 in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>
			<p><b>Occult Grimoire (Ex): </b>A true silvered throne&#146;s divine magic arises from communion with spirits alongside study of archaic lore compiled into a personal occult grimoire. Unlike a wizard&#146;s spellbook, this grimoire doesn&#146;t contain specific spells. By studying his grimoire, a true silvered throne can prepare any spell on the shaman spell list or provided by his spirit. If this grimoire is lost or destroyed, he cannot prepare new spells or use his spirit magic class feature until it is replaced, which requires 1 week of work. This ability replaces spirit animal.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Shamans can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;9. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Ritual Hex: </b>A true silvered throne gains Ritual Hex (see page 24) as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit (Su): </b>A shaman forms a mystical bond with the spirits of the world. She forms a lasting bond with a single spirit (see Spirits on page 37), which grants a number of abilities and defines many of her other class features.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a shaman gains the spirit ability granted by her chosen spirit. She adds the spells granted by that spirit to the list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She also adds the hexes possessed by that spirit to the list of hexes that she can use with the hex and wandering hex class features.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her selected spirit. At 16th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed for the true version of her selected spirit.</p>
			<p>If the shaman takes levels in another class that grants a mystery (such as the oracle), the spirit and mystery must match, even if that means one of them must change. Subject to GM discretion, the shaman can change her former mystery or spirit to make them conform.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Magic: </b>A shaman can spontaneously cast a limited number of spells per day beyond those she prepared ahead of time. She has one spell slot per day of each shaman spell level she can cast, not including orisons. She can choose these spells from the list of spells granted by her spirits (see the spirit class feature and the wandering spirit class feature) at the time she casts them. She can enhance these spells using any metamagic feat that she knows, using up a higher-level spell slot as required by the feat and increasing the time to cast the spell (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a shaman learns one hex. At 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.</p>
			<p>Using a hex is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Scarab of the Second Throne (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a true silvered throne successfully constructs a golden scarab that is infused with some of his occult potential. Treat this construct as a clockwork spy (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 58), except it has half its master&#146;s total hit points regardless of its Hit Dice and can write and take dictation rather than record audio. If worn in the true silvered throne&#146;s amulet slot, the golden scarab provides a +4 bonus to AC against sneak attacks and attacks of opportunity, as the scarab animates and moves to intercept attacks. If lost or destroyed, the golden scarab can be replaced in a week-long ritual costing 250 gp.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Ritual (Su): </b>At 6th level, a true silvered throne can attempt to coax a nearby spirit into service with a 1-minute-long ritual once per day, gaining that spirit&#146;s spirit ability and adding its list of spells to those he can cast using his spirit magic. The silvered throne can maintain this bond for 1 hour, or until he dismisses the spirit as a free action. At 12th level, he also gains this spirit&#146;s greater spirit power while bonded, and at 20th level gains its true spirit power as well. He can perform a wandering ritual one additional time per day at 8th level and 14th level. This ability replaces wandering spirit and wandering hex.</p>
			<p><b>Esoteric Rites (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a true silvered throne gains a +1 insight bonus on skill checks attempted as part of an occult ritual. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 shaman levels beyond 8th (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level). If the true silvered throne is the ritual&#146;s primary caster, he also adds this bonus to the caster level of the ritual&#146;s effect. This ability replaces the 8th-level hex.</p>
			<p><b>Manifestation (Su): </b>Upon reaching 20th level, a shaman undergoes a transformation as she manifests as a pinnacle of her main spirit. The nature of this manifestation depends on the shaman&#146;s spirit, and is described in its entry.</p>
			<h>Spirit Animal</h>
			<p>By communing with the incredible powers of her spirit, the shaman forges a cherished bond with one specif ic servant of that spirit&#151;known as a spirit animal. A spirit animal is a creature chosen by a shaman to serve as a conduit, allowing her to more fully access the magic of her spirit on a daily basis. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal also grants her special powers. This ability uses the same rules as the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature and is treated as a familiar (see pages 78 and 82 of the Core Rulebook), except as noted below.</p>
			<p>A shaman uses her level as her effective wizard level when determining the abilities of her spirit animal. A shaman can select any familiar available to wizards to serve as her spirit animal, although her spirit animal is augmented by the power of her chosen spirit. Once selected, the spirit animal cannot be changed. Although a shaman&#146;s spirit animal uses the statistics of a specific animal, it is treated as an outsider with the native subtype for the purposes of spells and abilities that affect it.</p>
			<p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack with shaman levels for the purpose of determining any spirit animal abilities that depend on the shaman&#146;s level. If a shaman possesses such levels in other classes, her spirit animal always uses the shaman rules for spirit animals, not those used by familiars of other classes (such as witches, wizards, or sorcerers with the arcane bloodline). If the shaman has witch levels, her spirit animal also serves as the conduit to her patron and stores her witch spells. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal is treated as a familiar for the purposes of all spells, effects, and abilities that affect familiars.</p>
			<p>If a spirit animal is lost or dies, it can be replaced after 24 hours through a special ritual that consumes material components worth 500 gp per shaman level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. The new spirit animal must be of the same sort of creature as the previous one.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman&#146;s spirit animal gains specific abilities, depending upon the type of spirit selected by the shaman using her spirit class feature. These abilities affect the animal&#146;s appearance and grant it special abilities that can aid it in serving the shaman and the spirit it represents and is connected to. These abilities are described in the spirit animal section of each individual spirit description.</p>
			<p><b>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </b>If a shaman is 3rd level or higher, her spirit animal can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the shaman and the spirit animal are in contact at the time the shaman casts a touch spell, she can designate her animal as the &#147;toucher.&#148; The spirit animal can then deliver the touch spell just as the shaman would. If the shaman casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the shaman activates a hex, her spirit animal can be used to make the touch; she doesn&#146;t have to be in contact with the animal to use this ability with hexes.</p>

					<p>A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Not all spirits deserve reverence and respect. Some are twisted and despicable. It&#146;s a spirit warden&#146;s duty to end these spirits&#146; existence.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>While some heroes speak to gods or consort with otherworldly muses, shamans commune with the spirits of the world and the energies that exist in every living thing. These divine adventurers draw upon their power to shape the world and expand the inf luence of their spiritual patrons. Shamans have strong ties to natural spirits. They form powerful bonds with particular spirits, and as their power grows they learn to call upon other spirits in times of need.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Shamans make for potent divine spellcasters, capable of using divine spells and the power of their spirits to aid their allies and destroy their foes. While they aren&#146;t the healers that clerics are, they can still fill that role when needed.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p>P <b>arent Class(es): </b>Oracle and witch.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shaman's class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), and Survival (Wis).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>A shaman is proficient with all simple weapons, and with light and medium armor.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the shaman spell list. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;9. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1&#150;3 in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Shamans can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;9. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Restless Magic (Su): </b>The spirit warden adds the following spells to the list of spells she can cast using spirit magic: detect undead (1st), command undead (2nd), halt undead (3rd), death ward (4th), possess objectUM (5th), undead to death (6th), ethereal jaunt (7th), control undead (8th), foresight (9th). This ability replaces the spirit magic spells gained from the shaman&#146;s spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit (Su): </b>A shaman forms a mystical bond with the spirits of the world. She forms a lasting bond with a single spirit (see Spirits on page 37), which grants a number of abilities and defines many of her other class features.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a shaman gains the spirit ability granted by her chosen spirit. She adds the spells granted by that spirit to the list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She also adds the hexes possessed by that spirit to the list of hexes that she can use with the hex and wandering hex class features.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her selected spirit. At 16th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed for the true version of her selected spirit.</p>
			<p>If the shaman takes levels in another class that grants a mystery (such as the oracle), the spirit and mystery must match, even if that means one of them must change. Subject to GM discretion, the shaman can change her former mystery or spirit to make them conform.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman forms a close bond with a spirit animal tied to her chosen spirit. This animal is her conduit to the spirit world, guiding her along the path to enlightenment. The animal also aids a shaman by granting her a special ability. See the Spirit Animal section on page 47.</p>
			<p>A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells. While the spirit animal does not store the spells like a witch&#146;s familiar does, the spirit animal serves as her conduit to divine power. If a shaman&#146;s spirit animal is slain, she cannot prepare new spells or use her spirit magic class feature until the spirit animal is replaced.</p>
			<p><b>Unnatural Mien (Ex): </b>At 1st level, the spirit warden&#146;s dealings with the spirit world give her an unsettling demeanor. Diplomacy and Handle Animal are not class skills for a spirit warden. Intimidate is added as a class skill, and she gains a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks to demoralize a foe.</p>
			<p><b>Rebuke Spirits (Su): </b>At 2nd level, the spirit warden gains the ability to channel positive energy as a cleric of her level. Regardless of her alignment, she can only use this ability to harm undead creatures. The spirit warden can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. This ability replaces the hex gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 4th level, a shaman learns one hex. At 8th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.</p>
			<p>Using a hex is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Spirit (Su): </b>At 4th level, a shaman can form a temporary bond with a spirit other than the one selected using her spirit class feature. She must make this selection each day when preparing her spells. While this feature is active, she gains the spirit ability granted by the spirit. She also adds the spells granted by that spirit to her list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She does not add the hexes from her wandering spirit to her list of hexes that she can choose from with the hex class feature. At 12th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit. At 20th level, she gains the ability listed in the true version of her wandering spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Hex: </b>At 6th level, a shaman can temporarily gain the use of one of the hexes possessed by either one of her spirits. She must make this selection each day when she prepares her spells. For the purposes of this ability, she can select any hex possessed by her spirit or wandering spirit. If she selects it from her wandering spirit, she loses the hex immediately if she bonds with another spirit, although she can then select a different hex to gain using this ability, from either her spirit or her new wandering spirit. At 14th level, a shaman can select two wandering hexes each day instead of one. This ability otherwise functions as the hex class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Laugh at Death (Su): </b>At 10th level, the spirit warden&#146;s familiarity with the dead has filled her with contempt for death itself. She gains a +4 insight bonus on saving throws against death effects and to avoid or remove negative levels. This ability replaces the hex gained at 10th level.</p>
			<p><b>Manifestation (Su): </b>Upon reaching 20th level, a shaman undergoes a transformation as she manifests as a pinnacle of her main spirit. The nature of this manifestation depends on the shaman&#146;s spirit, and is described in its entry.</p>
			<h>Spirit Animal</h>
			<p>By communing with the incredible powers of her spirit, the shaman forges a cherished bond with one specif ic servant of that spirit&#151;known as a spirit animal. A spirit animal is a creature chosen by a shaman to serve as a conduit, allowing her to more fully access the magic of her spirit on a daily basis. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal also grants her special powers. This ability uses the same rules as the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature and is treated as a familiar (see pages 78 and 82 of the Core Rulebook), except as noted below.</p>
			<p>A shaman uses her level as her effective wizard level when determining the abilities of her spirit animal. A shaman can select any familiar available to wizards to serve as her spirit animal, although her spirit animal is augmented by the power of her chosen spirit. Once selected, the spirit animal cannot be changed. Although a shaman&#146;s spirit animal uses the statistics of a specific animal, it is treated as an outsider with the native subtype for the purposes of spells and abilities that affect it.</p>
			<p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack with shaman levels for the purpose of determining any spirit animal abilities that depend on the shaman&#146;s level. If a shaman possesses such levels in other classes, her spirit animal always uses the shaman rules for spirit animals, not those used by familiars of other classes (such as witches, wizards, or sorcerers with the arcane bloodline). If the shaman has witch levels, her spirit animal also serves as the conduit to her patron and stores her witch spells. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal is treated as a familiar for the purposes of all spells, effects, and abilities that affect familiars.</p>
			<p>If a spirit animal is lost or dies, it can be replaced after 24 hours through a special ritual that consumes material components worth 500 gp per shaman level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. The new spirit animal must be of the same sort of creature as the previous one.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman&#146;s spirit animal gains specific abilities, depending upon the type of spirit selected by the shaman using her spirit class feature. These abilities affect the animal&#146;s appearance and grant it special abilities that can aid it in serving the shaman and the spirit it represents and is connected to. These abilities are described in the spirit animal section of each individual spirit description.</p>
			<p><b>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </b>If a shaman is 3rd level or higher, her spirit animal can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the shaman and the spirit animal are in contact at the time the shaman casts a touch spell, she can designate her animal as the &#147;toucher.&#148; The spirit animal can then deliver the touch spell just as the shaman would. If the shaman casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the shaman activates a hex, her spirit animal can be used to make the touch; she doesn&#146;t have to be in contact with the animal to use this ability with hexes.</p>

					<p>A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the shaman spell list. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
					<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;9. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1&#150;3 in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A speaker for the past is a shaman who specifically serves as the voice for spirits from her people&#146;s history. A speaker for the past is often an advocate of the ancestors of a specific group, the voice of experience, and a powerful resource that allows the past to aid the present.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>While some heroes speak to gods or consort with otherworldly muses, shamans commune with the spirits of the world and the energies that exist in every living thing. These divine adventurers draw upon their power to shape the world and expand the inf luence of their spiritual patrons. Shamans have strong ties to natural spirits. They form powerful bonds with particular spirits, and as their power grows they learn to call upon other spirits in times of need.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Shamans make for potent divine spellcasters, capable of using divine spells and the power of their spirits to aid their allies and destroy their foes. While they aren&#146;t the healers that clerics are, they can still fill that role when needed.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p>P <b>arent Class(es): </b>Oracle and witch.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shaman's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Survival (Wis), and Use Magic Device.</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>A shaman is proficient with all simple weapons, and with light and medium armor.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the shaman spell list. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;9. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1&#150;3 in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>
			<p><b>Mysteries of the Past: </b>A speaker for the past gains Linguistics, Knowledge (history), Knowledge (local), Perception, and Use Magic Device as class skills. She also adds the spells from the ancestorUM and timeUM oracle mysteries to her class spell list (as the cleric level for those spells).</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the shaman&#146;s familiar. The speaker for the past must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation to regain her daily allotment of spells, but does not need to commune with a familiar during this time. Because she has no familiar, she does not gain a spirit familiar feature from any spirit she bonds with.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Shamans can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;9. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit (Su): </b>A shaman forms a mystical bond with the spirits of the world. She forms a lasting bond with a single spirit (see Spirits on page 37), which grants a number of abilities and defines many of her other class features.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a shaman gains the spirit ability granted by her chosen spirit. She adds the spells granted by that spirit to the list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She also adds the hexes possessed by that spirit to the list of hexes that she can use with the hex and wandering hex class features.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her selected spirit. At 16th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed for the true version of her selected spirit.</p>
			<p>If the shaman takes levels in another class that grants a mystery (such as the oracle), the spirit and mystery must match, even if that means one of them must change. Subject to GM discretion, the shaman can change her former mystery or spirit to make them conform.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Magic: </b>A shaman can spontaneously cast a limited number of spells per day beyond those she prepared ahead of time. She has one spell slot per day of each shaman spell level she can cast, not including orisons. She can choose these spells from the list of spells granted by her spirits (see the spirit class feature and the wandering spirit class feature) at the time she casts them. She can enhance these spells using any metamagic feat that she knows, using up a higher-level spell slot as required by the feat and increasing the time to cast the spell (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a shaman learns one hex. At 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.</p>
			<p>Using a hex is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Revelations of the Past: </b>At 4th, 6th, 12th, 14th, and 20th levels, the speaker for the past can select a revelation from the ancestor or time mysteries. She uses her shaman level as her oracle level for these revelations, and uses her Wisdom modifier in place of her Charisma modifier for the purposes of the revelation. This ability replaces wandering spirit and wandering hex.</p>
			<p><b>Manifestation (Su): </b>Upon reaching 20th level, a shaman undergoes a transformation as she manifests as a pinnacle of her main spirit. The nature of this manifestation depends on the shaman&#146;s spirit, and is described in its entry.</p>
			<h>Spirit Animal</h>
			<p>By communing with the incredible powers of her spirit, the shaman forges a cherished bond with one specif ic servant of that spirit&#151;known as a spirit animal. A spirit animal is a creature chosen by a shaman to serve as a conduit, allowing her to more fully access the magic of her spirit on a daily basis. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal also grants her special powers. This ability uses the same rules as the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature and is treated as a familiar (see pages 78 and 82 of the Core Rulebook), except as noted below.</p>
			<p>A shaman uses her level as her effective wizard level when determining the abilities of her spirit animal. A shaman can select any familiar available to wizards to serve as her spirit animal, although her spirit animal is augmented by the power of her chosen spirit. Once selected, the spirit animal cannot be changed. Although a shaman&#146;s spirit animal uses the statistics of a specific animal, it is treated as an outsider with the native subtype for the purposes of spells and abilities that affect it.</p>
			<p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack with shaman levels for the purpose of determining any spirit animal abilities that depend on the shaman&#146;s level. If a shaman possesses such levels in other classes, her spirit animal always uses the shaman rules for spirit animals, not those used by familiars of other classes (such as witches, wizards, or sorcerers with the arcane bloodline). If the shaman has witch levels, her spirit animal also serves as the conduit to her patron and stores her witch spells. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal is treated as a familiar for the purposes of all spells, effects, and abilities that affect familiars.</p>
			<p>If a spirit animal is lost or dies, it can be replaced after 24 hours through a special ritual that consumes material components worth 500 gp per shaman level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. The new spirit animal must be of the same sort of creature as the previous one.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman&#146;s spirit animal gains specific abilities, depending upon the type of spirit selected by the shaman using her spirit class feature. These abilities affect the animal&#146;s appearance and grant it special abilities that can aid it in serving the shaman and the spirit it represents and is connected to. These abilities are described in the spirit animal section of each individual spirit description.</p>
			<p><b>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </b>If a shaman is 3rd level or higher, her spirit animal can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the shaman and the spirit animal are in contact at the time the shaman casts a touch spell, she can designate her animal as the &#147;toucher.&#148; The spirit animal can then deliver the touch spell just as the shaman would. If the shaman casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the shaman activates a hex, her spirit animal can be used to make the touch; she doesn&#146;t have to be in contact with the animal to use this ability with hexes.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Although some catfolk venerate elven and human deities, the traditional worship of the so-called &#147;spirits of creation&#148; is by far the most prevalent religion among their kind, especially in the catfolk nation of Murraseth. The serendipitous, shamanistic rites associated with this faith focus upon attracting good fortune and banishing ill fortune in the name of these spirits. Although the ancient practices of the serendipity shaman were once exclusive to the mysterious catfolk nation, the catfolk&#146;s curiosity and willingness to travel have spread them across Golarion, where today many with a tendency toward good fortune embrace the faith.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>While some heroes speak to gods or consort with otherworldly muses, shamans commune with the spirits of the world and the energies that exist in every living thing. These divine adventurers draw upon their power to shape the world and expand the inf luence of their spiritual patrons. Shamans have strong ties to natural spirits. They form powerful bonds with particular spirits, and as their power grows they learn to call upon other spirits in times of need.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Shamans make for potent divine spellcasters, capable of using divine spells and the power of their spirits to aid their allies and destroy their foes. While they aren&#146;t the healers that clerics are, they can still fill that role when needed.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>A shaman is proficient with all simple weapons, and with light and medium armor.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the shaman spell list. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;9. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1&#150;3 in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>
			<p><b>Limited Calling: </b>A shaman must have a racial trait with &#147;luck&#148; in its name to select this archetype, such as cat&#146;s luck or half ling luck. A character with the Defiant LuckARG feat also qualifies for this archetype.</p>
			<p><b>Luck Magic: </b>A serendipity shaman adds the domain spells from the Luck cleric domain to the list of spells she can cast with the spirit magic ability instead of her spirit&#146;s spirit magic spells.</p>
			<p>This ability alters spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Shamans can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;9. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit (Su): </b>A shaman forms a mystical bond with the spirits of the world. She forms a lasting bond with a single spirit (see Spirits on page 37), which grants a number of abilities and defines many of her other class features.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a shaman gains the spirit ability granted by her chosen spirit. She adds the spells granted by that spirit to the list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She also adds the hexes possessed by that spirit to the list of hexes that she can use with the hex and wandering hex class features.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her selected spirit. At 16th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed for the true version of her selected spirit.</p>
			<p>If the shaman takes levels in another class that grants a mystery (such as the oracle), the spirit and mystery must match, even if that means one of them must change. Subject to GM discretion, the shaman can change her former mystery or spirit to make them conform.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman forms a close bond with a spirit animal tied to her chosen spirit. This animal is her conduit to the spirit world, guiding her along the path to enlightenment. The animal also aids a shaman by granting her a special ability. See the Spirit Animal section on page 47.</p>
			<p>A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells. While the spirit animal does not store the spells like a witch&#146;s familiar does, the spirit animal serves as her conduit to divine power. If a shaman&#146;s spirit animal is slain, she cannot prepare new spells or use her spirit magic class feature until the spirit animal is replaced.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Magic: </b>A shaman can spontaneously cast a limited number of spells per day beyond those she prepared ahead of time. She has one spell slot per day of each shaman spell level she can cast, not including orisons. She can choose these spells from the list of spells granted by her spirits (see the spirit class feature and the wandering spirit class feature) at the time she casts them. She can enhance these spells using any metamagic feat that she knows, using up a higher-level spell slot as required by the feat and increasing the time to cast the spell (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a shaman learns one hex. At 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.</p>
			<p>Using a hex is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Luck Hexes: </b>A serendipity shaman can select from any of the following hexes, in addition to general shaman hexes and the hexes granted by her spirit. When she gains the wandering spirit class feature, she can select one of these hexes in place of a wandering hex.</p>
			<p><i>Channel Luck (Su): </i>A serendipity shaman gains the ability to channel luck, as the cleric variant channeling ability of the same name (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 30), using her shaman level to determine her effective cleric level for the purpose of her channel energy ability. She does not count as having the channel energy ability for the purpose of meeting feat prerequisites or prestige class requirements with the exception of Selective Channeling, which the shaman can take as normal. A shaman must be at least 8th level before selecting this hex.</p>
			<p><i>Fortune (Ex): </i>This hex functions as the dual-cursed oracle revelation of the same name (Ultimate Magic 58), using the shaman&#146;s class level as her effective oracle level.</p>
			<p><i>Misfortune (Ex): </i>As a standard action, a serendipity shaman can afflict one target within 30 feet with misfortune, causing it to take a &#150;2 penalty on all saving throws against the shaman&#146;s spells. The effect lasts for 1 minute or until the target hits the shaman with an attack.</p>
			<p><i>Spirit Magic: </i>A serendipity shaman adds both her spirit&#146;s spirit magic spells and the domain spells from the Luck cleric domain to the list of spells she can cast with the spirit magic ability. This hex cannot be taken as a wandering hex.</p>
			<p><i>Tweak the Odds (Su): </i>Whenever the serendipity shaman or one of her allies within 30 feet rolls an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, the shaman can use this ability as an immediate action to tweak the odds in her favor, increasing the result of the die roll or check by 1. This can turn a normal hit into a critical threat, but it cannot make an attack roll an automatic hit (this bonus does not stack with effects that increase a weapon&#146;s critical threat range, such as Improved Critical or keen edge). The shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her shaman level. At 4th level and every 4 shaman levels thereafter, she can spend an additional use of this ability to further increase the die result of the target&#146;s roll by an additional 1. For example, a 12th-level shaman can spend up to three uses of this ability to increase an ally&#146;s roll by 1 per use expended.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Spirit (Su): </b>At 4th level, a shaman can form a temporary bond with a spirit other than the one selected using her spirit class feature. She must make this selection each day when preparing her spells. While this feature is active, she gains the spirit ability granted by the spirit. She also adds the spells granted by that spirit to her list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She does not add the hexes from her wandering spirit to her list of hexes that she can choose from with the hex class feature. At 12th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit. At 20th level, she gains the ability listed in the true version of her wandering spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Hex: </b>At 6th level, a shaman can temporarily gain the use of one of the hexes possessed by either one of her spirits. She must make this selection each day when she prepares her spells. For the purposes of this ability, she can select any hex possessed by her spirit or wandering spirit. If she selects it from her wandering spirit, she loses the hex immediately if she bonds with another spirit, although she can then select a different hex to gain using this ability, from either her spirit or her new wandering spirit. At 14th level, a shaman can select two wandering hexes each day instead of one. This ability otherwise functions as the hex class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Manifestation (Su): </b>Upon reaching 20th level, a shaman undergoes a transformation as she manifests as a pinnacle of her main spirit. The nature of this manifestation depends on the shaman&#146;s spirit, and is described in its entry.</p>
			<h>Spirit Animal</h>
			<p>By communing with the incredible powers of her spirit, the shaman forges a cherished bond with one specif ic servant of that spirit&#151;known as a spirit animal. A spirit animal is a creature chosen by a shaman to serve as a conduit, allowing her to more fully access the magic of her spirit on a daily basis. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal also grants her special powers. This ability uses the same rules as the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature and is treated as a familiar (see pages 78 and 82 of the Core Rulebook), except as noted below.</p>
			<p>A shaman uses her level as her effective wizard level when determining the abilities of her spirit animal. A shaman can select any familiar available to wizards to serve as her spirit animal, although her spirit animal is augmented by the power of her chosen spirit. Once selected, the spirit animal cannot be changed. Although a shaman&#146;s spirit animal uses the statistics of a specific animal, it is treated as an outsider with the native subtype for the purposes of spells and abilities that affect it.</p>
			<p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack with shaman levels for the purpose of determining any spirit animal abilities that depend on the shaman&#146;s level. If a shaman possesses such levels in other classes, her spirit animal always uses the shaman rules for spirit animals, not those used by familiars of other classes (such as witches, wizards, or sorcerers with the arcane bloodline). If the shaman has witch levels, her spirit animal also serves as the conduit to her patron and stores her witch spells. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal is treated as a familiar for the purposes of all spells, effects, and abilities that affect familiars.</p>
			<p>If a spirit animal is lost or dies, it can be replaced after 24 hours through a special ritual that consumes material components worth 500 gp per shaman level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. The new spirit animal must be of the same sort of creature as the previous one.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman&#146;s spirit animal gains specific abilities, depending upon the type of spirit selected by the shaman using her spirit class feature. These abilities affect the animal&#146;s appearance and grant it special abilities that can aid it in serving the shaman and the spirit it represents and is connected to. These abilities are described in the spirit animal section of each individual spirit description.</p>
			<p><b>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </b>If a shaman is 3rd level or higher, her spirit animal can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the shaman and the spirit animal are in contact at the time the shaman casts a touch spell, she can designate her animal as the &#147;toucher.&#148; The spirit animal can then deliver the touch spell just as the shaman would. If the shaman casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the shaman activates a hex, her spirit animal can be used to make the touch; she doesn&#146;t have to be in contact with the animal to use this ability with hexes.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The influence of primal magic extends beyond what is visible and material. Spirits that linger in areas where primal magic reigns can become warped, losing touch with their former selves and experiencing random surges of power. A shaman who communes with such spirits learns to stabilize these erratic energies and draw upon them to her benefit. Such shamans gradually learn to guide their spirits toward coherence and lucidity, and in the process learn to bend chance and fortune in their favor.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>While some heroes speak to gods or consort with otherworldly muses, shamans commune with the spirits of the world and the energies that exist in every living thing. These divine adventurers draw upon their power to shape the world and expand the inf luence of their spiritual patrons. Shamans have strong ties to natural spirits. They form powerful bonds with particular spirits, and as their power grows they learn to call upon other spirits in times of need.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Shamans make for potent divine spellcasters, capable of using divine spells and the power of their spirits to aid their allies and destroy their foes. While they aren&#146;t the healers that clerics are, they can still fill that role when needed.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p>P <b>arent Class(es): </b>Oracle and witch.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shaman's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), and Survival (Wis).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>A shaman is proficient with all simple weapons, and with light and medium armor.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the shaman spell list. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;9. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1&#150;3 in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Shamans can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;9. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit (Su): </b>A shaman forms a mystical bond with the spirits of the world. She forms a lasting bond with a single spirit (see Spirits on page 37), which grants a number of abilities and defines many of her other class features.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a shaman gains the spirit ability granted by her chosen spirit. She adds the spells granted by that spirit to the list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She also adds the hexes possessed by that spirit to the list of hexes that she can use with the hex and wandering hex class features.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her selected spirit. At 16th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed for the true version of her selected spirit.</p>
			<p>If the shaman takes levels in another class that grants a mystery (such as the oracle), the spirit and mystery must match, even if that means one of them must change. Subject to GM discretion, the shaman can change her former mystery or spirit to make them conform.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>A primal warden&#146;s spirit animal exhibits unusual physical features for a creature of its type, such as unnatural colorations and extra or missing appendages. Each day, the spirit animal gains resistance 10 against a random element. Roll 1d4 to determine the type of resistance (1 = acid, 2 = cold, 3 = electricity, 4 = fire).</p>
			<p>This replaces the abilities the shaman&#146;s spirit animal gains from the shaman&#146;s chosen spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Magic: </b>A shaman can spontaneously cast a limited number of spells per day beyond those she prepared ahead of time. She has one spell slot per day of each shaman spell level she can cast, not including orisons. She can choose these spells from the list of spells granted by her spirits (see the spirit class feature and the wandering spirit class feature) at the time she casts them. She can enhance these spells using any metamagic feat that she knows, using up a higher-level spell slot as required by the feat and increasing the time to cast the spell (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a shaman learns one hex. At 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.</p>
			<p>Using a hex is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>A primal warden shaman gains the hexes below at the specified levels.</p>
			<p>A primal warden shaman cannot select the chant hex, the evil eye hex, the misfortune hex, or any witch hexes. This alters hexes and replaces the hexes gained at 4th and 12th levels.</p>
			<p><i>Primal Blessing (Su): </i>At 4th level, the shaman gains the ability to channel primal magic into a target within 30 feet. Roll 1d4 to determine the effect. On a result of 1, the target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks. On a result of 2, the target&#146;s size is enlarged or reduced, as per enlarge person or reduce person, and the effect functions even if the target is not a humanoid; roll randomly to determine the effect. On a result of 3, the target gains a +20-foot enhancement bonus to her base speed. On a result of 4, all attacks against the target suffer a 20% miss chance. The effects of this hex last for 1 minute. A creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.</p>
			<p><i>Greater Primal Blessing (Su): </i>At 12th level, the shaman&#146;s primal blessing hex improves. This functions as the primal blessing hex in all ways, except that the shaman has a chance to bestow greater benefits upon her targets. Roll 1d6 to determine the effect. On a result of 1&#150;4, refer to the primal blessing ability to determine the effect. On a roll of 5, the target gains a +2 luck bonus on attack rolls and saving throws and to her Armor Class. On a roll of 6, the target gains the benefit of the haste spell, using the primal warden&#146;s shaman level as her caster level.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Spirit (Su): </b>At 4th level, a shaman can form a temporary bond with a spirit other than the one selected using her spirit class feature. She must make this selection each day when preparing her spells. While this feature is active, she gains the spirit ability granted by the spirit. She also adds the spells granted by that spirit to her list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She does not add the hexes from her wandering spirit to her list of hexes that she can choose from with the hex class feature. At 12th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit. At 20th level, she gains the ability listed in the true version of her wandering spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Hex: </b>At 6th level, a shaman can temporarily gain the use of one of the hexes possessed by either one of her spirits. She must make this selection each day when she prepares her spells. For the purposes of this ability, she can select any hex possessed by her spirit or wandering spirit. If she selects it from her wandering spirit, she loses the hex immediately if she bonds with another spirit, although she can then select a different hex to gain using this ability, from either her spirit or her new wandering spirit. At 14th level, a shaman can select two wandering hexes each day instead of one. This ability otherwise functions as the hex class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Manifestation (Su): </b>Upon reaching 20th level, a shaman undergoes a transformation as she manifests as a pinnacle of her main spirit. The nature of this manifestation depends on the shaman&#146;s spirit, and is described in its entry.</p>
			<h>Spirit Animal</h>
			<p>By communing with the incredible powers of her spirit, the shaman forges a cherished bond with one specif ic servant of that spirit&#151;known as a spirit animal. A spirit animal is a creature chosen by a shaman to serve as a conduit, allowing her to more fully access the magic of her spirit on a daily basis. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal also grants her special powers. This ability uses the same rules as the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature and is treated as a familiar (see pages 78 and 82 of the Core Rulebook), except as noted below.</p>
			<p>A shaman uses her level as her effective wizard level when determining the abilities of her spirit animal. A shaman can select any familiar available to wizards to serve as her spirit animal, although her spirit animal is augmented by the power of her chosen spirit. Once selected, the spirit animal cannot be changed. Although a shaman&#146;s spirit animal uses the statistics of a specific animal, it is treated as an outsider with the native subtype for the purposes of spells and abilities that affect it.</p>
			<p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack with shaman levels for the purpose of determining any spirit animal abilities that depend on the shaman&#146;s level. If a shaman possesses such levels in other classes, her spirit animal always uses the shaman rules for spirit animals, not those used by familiars of other classes (such as witches, wizards, or sorcerers with the arcane bloodline). If the shaman has witch levels, her spirit animal also serves as the conduit to her patron and stores her witch spells. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal is treated as a familiar for the purposes of all spells, effects, and abilities that affect familiars.</p>
			<p>If a spirit animal is lost or dies, it can be replaced after 24 hours through a special ritual that consumes material components worth 500 gp per shaman level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. The new spirit animal must be of the same sort of creature as the previous one.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman&#146;s spirit animal gains specific abilities, depending upon the type of spirit selected by the shaman using her spirit class feature. These abilities affect the animal&#146;s appearance and grant it special abilities that can aid it in serving the shaman and the spirit it represents and is connected to. These abilities are described in the spirit animal section of each individual spirit description.</p>
			<p><b>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </b>If a shaman is 3rd level or higher, her spirit animal can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the shaman and the spirit animal are in contact at the time the shaman casts a touch spell, she can designate her animal as the &#147;toucher.&#148; The spirit animal can then deliver the touch spell just as the shaman would. If the shaman casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the shaman activates a hex, her spirit animal can be used to make the touch; she doesn&#146;t have to be in contact with the animal to use this ability with hexes.</p>

					<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;9.

					<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells.

					<p>A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells. While the spirit animal does not store the spells like a witch&#146;s familiar does, the spirit animal serves as her conduit to divine power.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>For a possessed shaman, merely communing with the spirit world is insufficient. Instead, she invites the spirits to share her body, granting them the chance to experience corporeal existence. In return, they grant her their skills and protect her from otherworldly influence.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>While some heroes speak to gods or consort with otherworldly muses, shamans commune with the spirits of the world and the energies that exist in every living thing. These divine adventurers draw upon their power to shape the world and expand the inf luence of their spiritual patrons. Shamans have strong ties to natural spirits. They form powerful bonds with particular spirits, and as their power grows they learn to call upon other spirits in times of need.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Shamans make for potent divine spellcasters, capable of using divine spells and the power of their spirits to aid their allies and destroy their foes. While they aren&#146;t the healers that clerics are, they can still fill that role when needed.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p>P <b>arent Class(es): </b>Oracle and witch.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shaman's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), and Survival (Wis).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Shamans can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;9. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit (Su): </b>A shaman forms a mystical bond with the spirits of the world. She forms a lasting bond with a single spirit (see Spirits on page 37), which grants a number of abilities and defines many of her other class features.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a shaman gains the spirit ability granted by her chosen spirit. She adds the spells granted by that spirit to the list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She also adds the hexes possessed by that spirit to the list of hexes that she can use with the hex and wandering hex class features.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her selected spirit. At 16th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed for the true version of her selected spirit.</p>
			<p>If the shaman takes levels in another class that grants a mystery (such as the oracle), the spirit and mystery must match, even if that means one of them must change. Subject to GM discretion, the shaman can change her former mystery or spirit to make them conform.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman forms a close bond with a spirit animal tied to her chosen spirit. This animal is her conduit to the spirit world, guiding her along the path to enlightenment. The animal also aids a shaman by granting her a special ability. See the Spirit Animal section on page 47.</p>
			<p>A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells. While the spirit animal does not store the spells like a witch&#146;s familiar does, the spirit animal serves as her conduit to divine power. If a shaman&#146;s spirit animal is slain, she cannot prepare new spells or use her spirit magic class feature until the spirit animal is replaced.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Magic: </b>A shaman can spontaneously cast a limited number of spells per day beyond those she prepared ahead of time. She has one spell slot per day of each shaman spell level she can cast, not including orisons. She can choose these spells from the list of spells granted by her spirits (see the spirit class feature and the wandering spirit class feature) at the time she casts them. She can enhance these spells using any metamagic feat that she knows, using up a higher-level spell slot as required by the feat and increasing the time to cast the spell (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a shaman learns one hex. At 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.</p>
			<p>Using a hex is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Spirit (Su): </b>At 4th level, a shaman can form a temporary bond with a spirit other than the one selected using her spirit class feature. She must make this selection each day when preparing her spells. While this feature is active, she gains the spirit ability granted by the spirit. She also adds the spells granted by that spirit to her list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She does not add the hexes from her wandering spirit to her list of hexes that she can choose from with the hex class feature. At 12th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit. At 20th level, she gains the ability listed in the true version of her wandering spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Skills (Su): </b>At 6th level, a possessed shaman is able to make room for another spirit. When choosing her wandering spirit for the day, the possessed shaman chooses one skill. The possessed shaman treats this skill as if she had a number of ranks in it equal to her shaman level, and uses her Wisdom modifier in place of the ability modifier the skill would normally use. If the skill is a class skill, she receives the usual +3 bonus on skill checks for having ranks in that skill. Each time the possessed shaman changes her wandering spirit, she can also change the skill gained through this ability. These ranks do not stack with her other skill ranks (only the higher number of ranks applies). This ability replaces the wandering hex gained at 6th level.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Hex: </b>At 14th level, a shaman can temporarily gain the use of one of the hexes possessed by either one of her spirits. She must make this selection each day when she prepares her spells. For the purposes of this ability, she can select any hex possessed by her spirit or wandering spirit. If she selects it from her wandering spirit, she loses the hex immediately if she bonds with another spirit, although she can then select a different hex to gain using this ability, from either her spirit or her new wandering spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Manifestation (Su): </b>Upon reaching 20th level, a shaman undergoes a transformation as she manifests as a pinnacle of her main spirit. The nature of this manifestation depends on the shaman&#146;s spirit, and is described in its entry.</p>
			<h>Spirit Animal</h>
			<p>By communing with the incredible powers of her spirit, the shaman forges a cherished bond with one specif ic servant of that spirit&#151;known as a spirit animal. A spirit animal is a creature chosen by a shaman to serve as a conduit, allowing her to more fully access the magic of her spirit on a daily basis. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal also grants her special powers. This ability uses the same rules as the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature and is treated as a familiar (see pages 78 and 82 of the Core Rulebook), except as noted below.</p>
			<p>A shaman uses her level as her effective wizard level when determining the abilities of her spirit animal. A shaman can select any familiar available to wizards to serve as her spirit animal, although her spirit animal is augmented by the power of her chosen spirit. Once selected, the spirit animal cannot be changed. Although a shaman&#146;s spirit animal uses the statistics of a specific animal, it is treated as an outsider with the native subtype for the purposes of spells and abilities that affect it.</p>
			<p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack with shaman levels for the purpose of determining any spirit animal abilities that depend on the shaman&#146;s level. If a shaman possesses such levels in other classes, her spirit animal always uses the shaman rules for spirit animals, not those used by familiars of other classes (such as witches, wizards, or sorcerers with the arcane bloodline). If the shaman has witch levels, her spirit animal also serves as the conduit to her patron and stores her witch spells. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal is treated as a familiar for the purposes of all spells, effects, and abilities that affect familiars.</p>
			<p>If a spirit animal is lost or dies, it can be replaced after 24 hours through a special ritual that consumes material components worth 500 gp per shaman level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. The new spirit animal must be of the same sort of creature as the previous one.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman&#146;s spirit animal gains specific abilities, depending upon the type of spirit selected by the shaman using her spirit class feature. These abilities affect the animal&#146;s appearance and grant it special abilities that can aid it in serving the shaman and the spirit it represents and is connected to. These abilities are described in the spirit animal section of each individual spirit description.</p>
			<p><b>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </b>If a shaman is 3rd level or higher, her spirit animal can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the shaman and the spirit animal are in contact at the time the shaman casts a touch spell, she can designate her animal as the &#147;toucher.&#148; The spirit animal can then deliver the touch spell just as the shaman would. If the shaman casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the shaman activates a hex, her spirit animal can be used to make the touch; she doesn&#146;t have to be in contact with the animal to use this ability with hexes.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>While all shamans use their connection to the spirits of the world to draw upon otherworldly magic powers, the shamans of the Lands of the Linnorm Kings have a unique tradition in which they use the power of patron spirits to directly control their enemies. Such overseers may assume roles as religious leaders and protectors of their tribes, turning foes into short-term allies for the tribe&#146;s greater good. Other overseers become tyrants who enforce their will upon the weak for personal gain. In combat, an overseer manages the battlefield by debilitating foes using her hexes and specialized spells.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>While some heroes speak to gods or consort with otherworldly muses, shamans commune with the spirits of the world and the energies that exist in every living thing. These divine adventurers draw upon their power to shape the world and expand the inf luence of their spiritual patrons. Shamans have strong ties to natural spirits. They form powerful bonds with particular spirits, and as their power grows they learn to call upon other spirits in times of need.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Shamans make for potent divine spellcasters, capable of using divine spells and the power of their spirits to aid their allies and destroy their foes. While they aren&#146;t the healers that clerics are, they can still fill that role when needed.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p>P <b>arent Class(es): </b>Oracle and witch.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shaman's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), and Survival (Wis).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>A shaman is proficient with all simple weapons, and with light and medium armor.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the shaman spell list. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;9. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1&#150;3 in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>
			<p><b>Controlling Magic (Su): </b>The overseer adds the following spells to the list of spells she can cast using spirit magic: charm person (1st), hideous laughter (2nd), hold person (3rd), crushing despair (4th), feeblemind (5th), mass suggestion (6th), power word blind (7th), irresistible dance (8th), and dominate monster (9th).</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the spirit magic spells gained from the shaman&#146;s spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Shamans can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;9. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit (Su): </b>A shaman forms a mystical bond with the spirits of the world. She forms a lasting bond with a single spirit (see Spirits on page 37), which grants a number of abilities and defines many of her other class features.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a shaman gains the spirit ability granted by her chosen spirit. She adds the spells granted by that spirit to the list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She also adds the hexes possessed by that spirit to the list of hexes that she can use with the hex and wandering hex class features.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her selected spirit. At 16th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed for the true version of her selected spirit.</p>
			<p>If the shaman takes levels in another class that grants a mystery (such as the oracle), the spirit and mystery must match, even if that means one of them must change. Subject to GM discretion, the shaman can change her former mystery or spirit to make them conform.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman forms a close bond with a spirit animal tied to her chosen spirit. This animal is her conduit to the spirit world, guiding her along the path to enlightenment. The animal also aids a shaman by granting her a special ability. See the Spirit Animal section on page 47.</p>
			<p>A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells. While the spirit animal does not store the spells like a witch&#146;s familiar does, the spirit animal serves as her conduit to divine power. If a shaman&#146;s spirit animal is slain, she cannot prepare new spells or use her spirit magic class feature until the spirit animal is replaced.</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a shaman learns one hex. At 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.</p>
			<p>Using a hex is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Surge (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, an overseer gains the ability to cast any of her mind-affecting spells that target a single creature through her spirit animal. When she&#146;s using this ability, the selected spell&#146;s range becomes touch, and she must deliver the spell through the spirit animal via the spirit animal&#146;s deliver touch spells supernatural ability. The shaman&#146;s effective caster level for these spells is 2 higher than her normal caster level. The overseer can deliver any other spells via the deliver touch spells spirit animal ability.</p>
			<p>This alters the deliver touch spells spirit animal ability.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Spirit (Su): </b>At 4th level, a shaman can form a temporary bond with a spirit other than the one selected using her spirit class feature. She must make this selection each day when preparing her spells. While this feature is active, she gains the spirit ability granted by the spirit. She also adds the spells granted by that spirit to her list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She does not add the hexes from her wandering spirit to her list of hexes that she can choose from with the hex class feature. At 12th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit. At 20th level, she gains the ability listed in the true version of her wandering spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Hex: </b>At 6th level, a shaman can temporarily gain the use of one of the hexes possessed by either one of her spirits. She must make this selection each day when she prepares her spells. For the purposes of this ability, she can select any hex possessed by her spirit or wandering spirit. If she selects it from her wandering spirit, she loses the hex immediately if she bonds with another spirit, although she can then select a different hex to gain using this ability, from either her spirit or her new wandering spirit. At 14th level, a shaman can select two wandering hexes each day instead of one. This ability otherwise functions as the hex class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Manifestation (Su): </b>Upon reaching 20th level, a shaman undergoes a transformation as she manifests as a pinnacle of her main spirit. The nature of this manifestation depends on the shaman&#146;s spirit, and is described in its entry.</p>
			<h>Spirit Animal</h>
			<p>By communing with the incredible powers of her spirit, the shaman forges a cherished bond with one specif ic servant of that spirit&#151;known as a spirit animal. A spirit animal is a creature chosen by a shaman to serve as a conduit, allowing her to more fully access the magic of her spirit on a daily basis. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal also grants her special powers. This ability uses the same rules as the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature and is treated as a familiar (see pages 78 and 82 of the Core Rulebook), except as noted below.</p>
			<p>A shaman uses her level as her effective wizard level when determining the abilities of her spirit animal. A shaman can select any familiar available to wizards to serve as her spirit animal, although her spirit animal is augmented by the power of her chosen spirit. Once selected, the spirit animal cannot be changed. Although a shaman&#146;s spirit animal uses the statistics of a specific animal, it is treated as an outsider with the native subtype for the purposes of spells and abilities that affect it.</p>
			<p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack with shaman levels for the purpose of determining any spirit animal abilities that depend on the shaman&#146;s level. If a shaman possesses such levels in other classes, her spirit animal always uses the shaman rules for spirit animals, not those used by familiars of other classes (such as witches, wizards, or sorcerers with the arcane bloodline). If the shaman has witch levels, her spirit animal also serves as the conduit to her patron and stores her witch spells. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal is treated as a familiar for the purposes of all spells, effects, and abilities that affect familiars.</p>
			<p>If a spirit animal is lost or dies, it can be replaced after 24 hours through a special ritual that consumes material components worth 500 gp per shaman level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. The new spirit animal must be of the same sort of creature as the previous one.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman&#146;s spirit animal gains specific abilities, depending upon the type of spirit selected by the shaman using her spirit class feature. These abilities affect the animal&#146;s appearance and grant it special abilities that can aid it in serving the shaman and the spirit it represents and is connected to. These abilities are described in the spirit animal section of each individual spirit description.</p>
			<p><b>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </b>If a shaman is 3rd level or higher, her spirit animal can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the shaman and the spirit animal are in contact at the time the shaman casts a touch spell, she can designate her animal as the &#147;toucher.&#148; The spirit animal can then deliver the touch spell just as the shaman would. If the shaman casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the shaman activates a hex, her spirit animal can be used to make the touch; she doesn&#146;t have to be in contact with the animal to use this ability with hexes.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Pathfinders who perish in the pursuit of greater knowledge are commemorated on the Wall of Names, a curving monument of black glass at the Grand Lodge. Originally started as a humble memorial, the Wall of Names is now a moving testament to all those who have given their lives to further the cause of the Pathfinder Society, and for many agents, an expedition to Absalom is as much a chance to visit the Wall of Names and seek out a vanished loved one, relation, or departed friend as it is an opportunity to visit the place where it all began.</i></p>
			<p><i>A decade ago, a small cadre of agents began studying the fallen names, correlating these adventurers with the quests they were on when they perished or went missing, and then took it upon themselves to finish these incomplete missions&#151; but in so doing these agents made an unexpected discovery. In delving into the storied histories etched into the Wall of Names, these agents have discovered how to commune with the departed spirits of those whose names are memorialized on the monument. These mystical agents soon became known as name-keepers, and they pride themselves on helping their predecessors find peace while preventing other Pathfinders&#146; names from being added to the wall.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>While some heroes speak to gods or consort with otherworldly muses, shamans commune with the spirits of the world and the energies that exist in every living thing. These divine adventurers draw upon their power to shape the world and expand the inf luence of their spiritual patrons. Shamans have strong ties to natural spirits. They form powerful bonds with particular spirits, and as their power grows they learn to call upon other spirits in times of need.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Shamans make for potent divine spellcasters, capable of using divine spells and the power of their spirits to aid their allies and destroy their foes. While they aren&#146;t the healers that clerics are, they can still fill that role when needed.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p>P <b>arent Class(es): </b>Oracle and witch.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shaman's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), and Spellcraft (Int).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>A shaman is proficient with all simple weapons, and with light and medium armor.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the shaman spell list. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;9. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1&#150;3 in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>
			<p><b>Inherited Wayfinder (Su): </b>A name-keeper forms a powerful bond with a damaged wayfinder (see pages 148&#150;149) inherited from another Pathfinder. It functions for her alone. This functions as a wizard&#146;s bonded object except it can be used to cast shaman spells (instead of wizard spells).</p>
			<p>This ability replaces spirit animal.</p>
			<p><b>Keeper Spirit Magic: </b>The namekeeper adds the following spells to the list of spells she can cast using spirit magic: stone shieldARG (1st), object readingOA (2nd), speak with dead (3rd), wall of stone (4th), breath of life (5th), stone tell (6th), vision (7th), word of recall (8th), and true resurrection (9th).</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the spirit magic spells gained from the shaman&#146;s spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Shamans can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;9. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit (Su): </b>A shaman forms a mystical bond with the spirits of the world. She forms a lasting bond with a single spirit (see Spirits on page 37), which grants a number of abilities and defines many of her other class features.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a shaman gains the spirit ability granted by her chosen spirit. She adds the spells granted by that spirit to the list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She also adds the hexes possessed by that spirit to the list of hexes that she can use with the hex and wandering hex class features.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her selected spirit. At 16th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed for the true version of her selected spirit.</p>
			<p>If the shaman takes levels in another class that grants a mystery (such as the oracle), the spirit and mystery must match, even if that means one of them must change. Subject to GM discretion, the shaman can change her former mystery or spirit to make them conform.</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a shaman learns one hex. At 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.</p>
			<p>Using a hex is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Pathfinders Past (Su): </b>At 4th level, a name-keeper can form a temporary bond with a deceased Pathfinder who is commemorated on the Wall of Names. The namekeeper must make this selection each day when preparing her spells. While this feature is active, she gains one or more benefits tied to the Pathfinder&#146;s former focus in the Society: Scrolls, Spells, or Swords. Each allows her to select one or more options (such as a weapon or shaman spirit), and she can choose different options each time she forms this bond.</p>
			<p><i>Scrolls: </i>The name-keeper selects an oracleAPG mystery. She can use any of the mystery&#146;s associated skills untrained, and she treats them as class skills. For any of those skills that were already class skills, she instead gains a +2 sacred bonus on those checks. At 12th level, she gains Skill Focus for one of the associated skills as a bonus feat. At 20th level, she gains Skill Focus a second time as a bonus feat, and she always counts as having at least 10 ranks in those skills for calculating these temporary feats&#146; benefits.</p>
			<p><i>Spells: </i>The name-keeper selects a second shaman spirit and adds the spells granted by that spirit to her list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She gains one additional spirit magic spell slot of her highest spell level. At 12th level, she selects two shaman spirits and adds both their granted spells to the list of spells she can cast using spirit magic. At 20th level, her number of spirit magic spell slots at each spell level increases to two.</p>
			<p><i>Swords: </i>The name-keeper gains proficiency in all martial weapons and one exotic weapon of her choice. At 12th level, whenever she makes a full attack, she gains one additional attack at her highest base attack bonus; this ability stacks with the extra attack from haste, but it doesn&#146;t stack with other abilities that grant extra attacks. At 20th level, she gains two combat feats for which she qualifies.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces wandering spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Versatile Hex (Su): </b>At 6th level, a namekeeper can temporarily gain a shaman hex or one of the hexes that her spirit has when she prepares her spells, lasting until the next time she prepares spells. At 14th level, she can select two such hexes each day.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces wandering hex.</p>
			<p><b>Manifestation (Su): </b>Upon reaching 20th level, a shaman undergoes a transformation as she manifests as a pinnacle of her main spirit. The nature of this manifestation depends on the shaman&#146;s spirit, and is described in its entry.</p>
			<h>Spirit Animal</h>
			<p>By communing with the incredible powers of her spirit, the shaman forges a cherished bond with one specif ic servant of that spirit&#151;known as a spirit animal. A spirit animal is a creature chosen by a shaman to serve as a conduit, allowing her to more fully access the magic of her spirit on a daily basis. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal also grants her special powers. This ability uses the same rules as the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature and is treated as a familiar (see pages 78 and 82 of the Core Rulebook), except as noted below.</p>
			<p>A shaman uses her level as her effective wizard level when determining the abilities of her spirit animal. A shaman can select any familiar available to wizards to serve as her spirit animal, although her spirit animal is augmented by the power of her chosen spirit. Once selected, the spirit animal cannot be changed. Although a shaman&#146;s spirit animal uses the statistics of a specific animal, it is treated as an outsider with the native subtype for the purposes of spells and abilities that affect it.</p>
			<p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack with shaman levels for the purpose of determining any spirit animal abilities that depend on the shaman&#146;s level. If a shaman possesses such levels in other classes, her spirit animal always uses the shaman rules for spirit animals, not those used by familiars of other classes (such as witches, wizards, or sorcerers with the arcane bloodline). If the shaman has witch levels, her spirit animal also serves as the conduit to her patron and stores her witch spells. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal is treated as a familiar for the purposes of all spells, effects, and abilities that affect familiars.</p>
			<p>If a spirit animal is lost or dies, it can be replaced after 24 hours through a special ritual that consumes material components worth 500 gp per shaman level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. The new spirit animal must be of the same sort of creature as the previous one.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman&#146;s spirit animal gains specific abilities, depending upon the type of spirit selected by the shaman using her spirit class feature. These abilities affect the animal&#146;s appearance and grant it special abilities that can aid it in serving the shaman and the spirit it represents and is connected to. These abilities are described in the spirit animal section of each individual spirit description.</p>
			<p><b>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </b>If a shaman is 3rd level or higher, her spirit animal can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the shaman and the spirit animal are in contact at the time the shaman casts a touch spell, she can designate her animal as the &#147;toucher.&#148; The spirit animal can then deliver the touch spell just as the shaman would. If the shaman casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the shaman activates a hex, her spirit animal can be used to make the touch; she doesn&#146;t have to be in contact with the animal to use this ability with hexes.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a shaman forms a close bond with a spirit animal tied to her chosen spirit. This animal is her conduit to the spirit world, guiding her along the path to enlightenment. The animal also aids a shaman by granting her a special ability. See the Spirit Animal section on page 47.</p>
					<p>A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells. While the spirit animal does not store the spells like a witch&#146;s familiar does, the spirit animal serves as her conduit to divine power. If a shaman&#146;s spirit animal is slain, she cannot prepare new spells or use her spirit magic class feature until the spirit animal is replaced.</p>

					<p>At 2nd level, as a standard action, a grasping vine can use speak with plants as a spell-like ability. The grasping vine can use this ability a number of times per day equal to half her shaman level. In addition, while under the effects of speak with plants, the grasping vine can deliver a suggestion (as per the spell) to a single plant creature within 30 feet, ignoring the plant&#146;s immunity to mind-affecting effects. The grasping vine can use this ability once per day at 2nd level, plus an additional time per day every 4 levels after 2nd level.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Grasping vine shamans are typically adherents of one of several scattered sects dedicated to the Green Mother. They revere plant life in all its forms, with a special fondness for poisonous or carnivorous plants. Unlike most shamans, a grasping vine is guided by a plantlike creature rather than a spirit animal.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>While some heroes speak to gods or consort with otherworldly muses, shamans commune with the spirits of the world and the energies that exist in every living thing. These divine adventurers draw upon their power to shape the world and expand the inf luence of their spiritual patrons. Shamans have strong ties to natural spirits. They form powerful bonds with particular spirits, and as their power grows they learn to call upon other spirits in times of need.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Shamans make for potent divine spellcasters, capable of using divine spells and the power of their spirits to aid their allies and destroy their foes. While they aren&#146;t the healers that clerics are, they can still fill that role when needed.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p>P <b>arent Class(es): </b>Oracle and witch.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shaman's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), and Survival (Wis).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>A shaman is proficient with all simple weapons, and with light and medium armor.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the shaman spell list. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;9. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1&#150;3 in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Shamans can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;9. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Plant Spirit (Ex): </b>A shaman&#146;s spirit animal is made of leaves and thorny vines. This plant spirit has the statistics and abilities as a shaman&#146;s spirit animal, but it is treated as a creature of the plant type rather than a native outsider.</p>
			<p>This ability alters the shaman&#146;s spirit animal.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit (Su): </b>Though a grasping vine is not limited to a particular choice of spirit, common selections are Life, Nature, or Wood (Pathfinder Player Companion Heroes of the Wild 26).</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a shaman gains the spirit ability granted by her chosen spirit. She adds the spells granted by that spirit to the list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She also adds the hexes possessed by that spirit to the list of hexes that she can use with the hex and wandering hex class features.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her selected spirit. At 16th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed for the true version of her selected spirit.</p>
			<p>If the shaman takes levels in another class that grants a mystery (such as the oracle), the spirit and mystery must match, even if that means one of them must change. Subject to GM discretion, the shaman can change her former mystery or spirit to make them conform.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman forms a close bond with a spirit animal tied to her chosen spirit. This animal is her conduit to the spirit world, guiding her along the path to enlightenment. The animal also aids a shaman by granting her a special ability. See the Spirit Animal section on page 47.</p>
			<p>A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells. While the spirit animal does not store the spells like a witch&#146;s familiar does, the spirit animal serves as her conduit to divine power. If a shaman&#146;s spirit animal is slain, she cannot prepare new spells or use her spirit magic class feature until the spirit animal is replaced.</p>
			<p><b>Verdant Magic: </b>A grasping vine adds the following spells to the list of spells she can cast using spirit magic: entangle (1st), barkskin (2nd), thorny entanglementACG (3rd), command plants (4th), wall of thorns (5th), fire seeds (6th), animate plants (7th), horrid wilting (8th), and shambler (9th).</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the spirit magic spells granted by the shaman&#146;s spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Greentongue (Sp): </b>At 2nd level, as a standard action, a grasping vine can use speak with plants as a spell-like ability. The grasping vine can use this ability a number of times per day equal to half her shaman level. In addition, while under the effects of speak with plants, the grasping vine can deliver a suggestion (as per the spell) to a single plant creature within 30 feet, ignoring the plant&#146;s immunity to mind-affecting effects. The grasping vine can use this ability once per day at 2nd level, plus an additional time per day every 4 levels after 2nd level.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the shaman&#146;s hex gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 4th level, a shaman learns one hex. At 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.</p>
			<p>Using a hex is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Spirit (Su): </b>At 4th level, a shaman can form a temporary bond with a spirit other than the one selected using her spirit class feature. She must make this selection each day when preparing her spells. While this feature is active, she gains the spirit ability granted by the spirit. She also adds the spells granted by that spirit to her list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She does not add the hexes from her wandering spirit to her list of hexes that she can choose from with the hex class feature. At 12th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit. At 20th level, she gains the ability listed in the true version of her wandering spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Hex: </b>At 6th level, a shaman can temporarily gain the use of one of the hexes possessed by either one of her spirits. She must make this selection each day when she prepares her spells. For the purposes of this ability, she can select any hex possessed by her spirit or wandering spirit. If she selects it from her wandering spirit, she loses the hex immediately if she bonds with another spirit, although she can then select a different hex to gain using this ability, from either her spirit or her new wandering spirit. At 14th level, a shaman can select two wandering hexes each day instead of one. This ability otherwise functions as the hex class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Flower&#146;s Form (Sp): </b>At 8th level, as a standard action, a grasping vine can assume the form of a Small or Medium plant creature, as per plant shape I. At 12th level, this ability functions as plant shape II. At 16th level, this ability functions as plant shape III. The grasping vine can use this ability for 1 minute per shaman level per day. This duration does not need to be used consecutively, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the shaman&#146;s hex gained at 8th level.</p>
			<p><b>Manifestation (Su): </b>Upon reaching 20th level, a shaman undergoes a transformation as she manifests as a pinnacle of her main spirit. The nature of this manifestation depends on the shaman&#146;s spirit, and is described in its entry.</p>
			<h>Spirit Animal</h>
			<p>By communing with the incredible powers of her spirit, the shaman forges a cherished bond with one specif ic servant of that spirit&#151;known as a spirit animal. A spirit animal is a creature chosen by a shaman to serve as a conduit, allowing her to more fully access the magic of her spirit on a daily basis. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal also grants her special powers. This ability uses the same rules as the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature and is treated as a familiar (see pages 78 and 82 of the Core Rulebook), except as noted below.</p>
			<p>A shaman uses her level as her effective wizard level when determining the abilities of her spirit animal. A shaman can select any familiar available to wizards to serve as her spirit animal, although her spirit animal is augmented by the power of her chosen spirit. Once selected, the spirit animal cannot be changed. Although a shaman&#146;s spirit animal uses the statistics of a specific animal, it is treated as an outsider with the native subtype for the purposes of spells and abilities that affect it.</p>
			<p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack with shaman levels for the purpose of determining any spirit animal abilities that depend on the shaman&#146;s level. If a shaman possesses such levels in other classes, her spirit animal always uses the shaman rules for spirit animals, not those used by familiars of other classes (such as witches, wizards, or sorcerers with the arcane bloodline). If the shaman has witch levels, her spirit animal also serves as the conduit to her patron and stores her witch spells. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal is treated as a familiar for the purposes of all spells, effects, and abilities that affect familiars.</p>
			<p>If a spirit animal is lost or dies, it can be replaced after 24 hours through a special ritual that consumes material components worth 500 gp per shaman level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. The new spirit animal must be of the same sort of creature as the previous one.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman&#146;s spirit animal gains specific abilities, depending upon the type of spirit selected by the shaman using her spirit class feature. These abilities affect the animal&#146;s appearance and grant it special abilities that can aid it in serving the shaman and the spirit it represents and is connected to. These abilities are described in the spirit animal section of each individual spirit description.</p>
			<p><b>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </b>If a shaman is 3rd level or higher, her spirit animal can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the shaman and the spirit animal are in contact at the time the shaman casts a touch spell, she can designate her animal as the &#147;toucher.&#148; The spirit animal can then deliver the touch spell just as the shaman would. If the shaman casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the shaman activates a hex, her spirit animal can be used to make the touch; she doesn&#146;t have to be in contact with the animal to use this ability with hexes.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>In some regions of Tian Xia, shamans are unusually common, and may have strong ties to dragon gods and imperial dragons who act as mentors. Some of these shamans draw their powers from the might of dragons, rather than from spirits. These shamans each gain a powerful drake as an ally, and view caring for that drake as a sacred duty.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>While some heroes speak to gods or consort with otherworldly muses, shamans commune with the spirits of the world and the energies that exist in every living thing. These divine adventurers draw upon their power to shape the world and expand the inf luence of their spiritual patrons. Shamans have strong ties to natural spirits. They form powerful bonds with particular spirits, and as their power grows they learn to call upon other spirits in times of need.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Shamans make for potent divine spellcasters, capable of using divine spells and the power of their spirits to aid their allies and destroy their foes. While they aren&#146;t the healers that clerics are, they can still fill that role when needed.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p>P <b>arent Class(es): </b>Oracle and witch.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shaman's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), and Survival (Wis).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>A shaman is proficient with all simple weapons, and with light and medium armor.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the shaman spell list. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;9. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1&#150;3 in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Shamans can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;9. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Drake Companion: </b>A draconic shaman gains a drake companion instead of a spirit animal, and she communes with the drake to prepare her spells just as other shamans commune with their spirit animals. She doesn&#146;t gain a primary spirit, but she still gains wandering spirit at 4th level. She must select all her hexes (other than her wandering hexes) from the list of shaman hexes, and she can&#146;t select the witch hex shaman hex. She doesn&#146;t gain spirit magic slots until 4th level when she gains her wandering spirit. Any ability granted by a wandering spirit that would normally affect a spirit animal (such as nature&#146;s true spirit ability) has no effect for a draconic shaman.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces spirit, spirit animal, and the hexes gained at 4th and 10th levels and alters spirit magic.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Magic: </b>A shaman can spontaneously cast a limited number of spells per day beyond those she prepared ahead of time. She has one spell slot per day of each shaman spell level she can cast, not including orisons. She can choose these spells from the list of spells granted by her spirits (see the spirit class feature and the wandering spirit class feature) at the time she casts them. She can enhance these spells using any metamagic feat that she knows, using up a higher-level spell slot as required by the feat and increasing the time to cast the spell (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a shaman learns one hex. At 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.</p>
			<p>Using a hex is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Spirit (Su): </b>At 4th level, a shaman can form a temporary bond with a spirit other than the one selected using her spirit class feature. She must make this selection each day when preparing her spells. While this feature is active, she gains the spirit ability granted by the spirit. She also adds the spells granted by that spirit to her list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She does not add the hexes from her wandering spirit to her list of hexes that she can choose from with the hex class feature. At 12th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit. At 20th level, she gains the ability listed in the true version of her wandering spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Hex: </b>At 6th level, a shaman can temporarily gain the use of one of the hexes possessed by either one of her spirits. She must make this selection each day when she prepares her spells. For the purposes of this ability, she can select any hex possessed by her spirit or wandering spirit. If she selects it from her wandering spirit, she loses the hex immediately if she bonds with another spirit, although she can then select a different hex to gain using this ability, from either her spirit or her new wandering spirit. At 14th level, a shaman can select two wandering hexes each day instead of one. This ability otherwise functions as the hex class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Manifestation (Su): </b>Upon reaching 20th level, a shaman undergoes a transformation as she manifests as a pinnacle of her main spirit. The nature of this manifestation depends on the shaman&#146;s spirit, and is described in its entry.</p>
			<h>Spirit Animal</h>
			<p>By communing with the incredible powers of her spirit, the shaman forges a cherished bond with one specif ic servant of that spirit&#151;known as a spirit animal. A spirit animal is a creature chosen by a shaman to serve as a conduit, allowing her to more fully access the magic of her spirit on a daily basis. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal also grants her special powers. This ability uses the same rules as the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature and is treated as a familiar (see pages 78 and 82 of the Core Rulebook), except as noted below.</p>
			<p>A shaman uses her level as her effective wizard level when determining the abilities of her spirit animal. A shaman can select any familiar available to wizards to serve as her spirit animal, although her spirit animal is augmented by the power of her chosen spirit. Once selected, the spirit animal cannot be changed. Although a shaman&#146;s spirit animal uses the statistics of a specific animal, it is treated as an outsider with the native subtype for the purposes of spells and abilities that affect it.</p>
			<p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack with shaman levels for the purpose of determining any spirit animal abilities that depend on the shaman&#146;s level. If a shaman possesses such levels in other classes, her spirit animal always uses the shaman rules for spirit animals, not those used by familiars of other classes (such as witches, wizards, or sorcerers with the arcane bloodline). If the shaman has witch levels, her spirit animal also serves as the conduit to her patron and stores her witch spells. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal is treated as a familiar for the purposes of all spells, effects, and abilities that affect familiars.</p>
			<p>If a spirit animal is lost or dies, it can be replaced after 24 hours through a special ritual that consumes material components worth 500 gp per shaman level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. The new spirit animal must be of the same sort of creature as the previous one.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman&#146;s spirit animal gains specific abilities, depending upon the type of spirit selected by the shaman using her spirit class feature. These abilities affect the animal&#146;s appearance and grant it special abilities that can aid it in serving the shaman and the spirit it represents and is connected to. These abilities are described in the spirit animal section of each individual spirit description.</p>
			<p><b>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </b>If a shaman is 3rd level or higher, her spirit animal can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the shaman and the spirit animal are in contact at the time the shaman casts a touch spell, she can designate her animal as the &#147;toucher.&#148; The spirit animal can then deliver the touch spell just as the shaman would. If the shaman casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the shaman activates a hex, her spirit animal can be used to make the touch; she doesn&#146;t have to be in contact with the animal to use this ability with hexes.</p>

					<p>A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells.

At 12th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit. At 20th level, she gains the ability listed in the true version of her wandering spirit.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>While most shamans of the waves spirit have powers associated with surface waters, deep shamans are tied to spirits from the depths. Some say that the first deep shamans served Besmara back when she was a water spirit, before she achieved full godhood.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>While some heroes speak to gods or consort with otherworldly muses, shamans commune with the spirits of the world and the energies that exist in every living thing. These divine adventurers draw upon their power to shape the world and expand the inf luence of their spiritual patrons. Shamans have strong ties to natural spirits. They form powerful bonds with particular spirits, and as their power grows they learn to call upon other spirits in times of need.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Shamans make for potent divine spellcasters, capable of using divine spells and the power of their spirits to aid their allies and destroy their foes. While they aren&#146;t the healers that clerics are, they can still fill that role when needed.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p>P <b>arent Class(es): </b>Oracle and witch.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shaman's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), and Survival (Wis).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>A shaman is proficient with all simple weapons, and with light and medium armor.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the shaman spell list. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;9. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1&#150;3 in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>
			<p><b>Aquatic Spirit Abilities (Su): </b>When used underwater, a deep shaman&#146;s wave strike deals lethal bludgeoning damage and pushes the target away 5 feet + an additional 5 feet for every 6 shaman levels she has. At 11th level, whenever the deep shaman is underwater, all weapons she holds are treated as if they had the impact special ability instead of quenching. Instead of a swim speed and the ability to breathe underwater, fluid mastery provides tremorsense with a range of 30 feet while in the water, and when underwater, fluid mastery&#146;s torrent deals 1d6 points of damage per shaman level in a 30-foot cone.</p>
			<p>This alters spirit ability and greater spirit ability.</p>
			<p><b>Brine Dragon Form (Su): </b>When a deep shaman gains access to the true version of the waves spirit, she can assume the form of a Large (or smaller) brine dragon as per form of the dragon II, with a line of acid breath weapon, acid resistance 20, and a swim speed of 60 feet. She can use this ability for 1 hour per shaman level each day, divided any way she chooses in 1 hour increments, though the spell&#146;s breath weapon limit applies across the whole day. Time she spends underwater doesn&#146;t count against this limit, but every minute (or fraction thereof ) that she spends flying expends 1 hour of her daily uses. At 18th level, she can assume the form of a Huge or smaller brine dragon as per form of the dragon III instead.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the elemental form of the true spirit ability.</p>
			<p><b>Deep Spirit: </b>A deep shaman must choose the waves spirit. The deep shaman must choose a spirit animal with the aquatic subtype, and it gains the amphibious special quality instead of gaining the ability to breathe in water. A deep shaman gains Swim as a class skill.</p>
			<p>This alters spirit, spirit animal, and the shaman&#146;s class skills.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Shamans can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;9. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit (Su): </b>A shaman forms a mystical bond with the spirits of the world. She forms a lasting bond with a single spirit (see Spirits on page 37), which grants a number of abilities and defines many of her other class features.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a shaman gains the spirit ability granted by her chosen spirit. She adds the spells granted by that spirit to the list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She also adds the hexes possessed by that spirit to the list of hexes that she can use with the hex and wandering hex class features.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her selected spirit. At 16th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed for the true version of her selected spirit.</p>
			<p>If the shaman takes levels in another class that grants a mystery (such as the oracle), the spirit and mystery must match, even if that means one of them must change. Subject to GM discretion, the shaman can change her former mystery or spirit to make them conform.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman forms a close bond with a spirit animal tied to her chosen spirit. This animal is her conduit to the spirit world, guiding her along the path to enlightenment. The animal also aids a shaman by granting her a special ability. See the Spirit Animal section on page 47.</p>
			<p>A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells. While the spirit animal does not store the spells like a witch&#146;s familiar does, the spirit animal serves as her conduit to divine power. If a shaman&#146;s spirit animal is slain, she cannot prepare new spells or use her spirit magic class feature until the spirit animal is replaced.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Magic: </b>A shaman can spontaneously cast a limited number of spells per day beyond those she prepared ahead of time. She has one spell slot per day of each shaman spell level she can cast, not including orisons. She can choose these spells from the list of spells granted by her spirits (see the spirit class feature and the wandering spirit class feature) at the time she casts them. She can enhance these spells using any metamagic feat that she knows, using up a higher-level spell slot as required by the feat and increasing the time to cast the spell (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p><b>Aquatic Hexes (Su): </b>When a deep shaman uses beckoning chill on a creature in the water, that creature becomes fatigued due to hypothermia for the duration, and it also becomes entangled if the creature takes damage from he deep shaman&#146;s spirit abilities and from spells and abilities with the water descriptor. Her crashing waves hex applies to her spirit abilities that deal damage as if they were spells with the water descriptor, raising her effective shaman level for those abilities. Instead of mist&#146;s shroud and watersight, she can select the two hexes below.</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a shaman learns one hex. At 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.</p>
			<p>Using a hex is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Spirit (Su): </b>At 4th level, a shaman can form a temporary bond with a spirit other than the one selected using her spirit class feature. She must make this selection each day when preparing her spells. While this feature is active, she gains the spirit ability granted by the spirit. She also adds the spells granted by that spirit to her list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She does not add the hexes from her wandering spirit to her list of hexes that she can choose from with the hex class feature. At 12th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit. At 20th level, she gains the ability listed in the true version of her wandering spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Hex: </b>At 6th level, a shaman can temporarily gain the use of one of the hexes possessed by either one of her spirits. She must make this selection each day when she prepares her spells. For the purposes of this ability, she can select any hex possessed by her spirit or wandering spirit. If she selects it from her wandering spirit, she loses the hex immediately if she bonds with another spirit, although she can then select a different hex to gain using this ability, from either her spirit or her new wandering spirit. At 14th level, a shaman can select two wandering hexes each day instead of one. This ability otherwise functions as the hex class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Manifestation (Su): </b>Upon reaching 20th level, a shaman undergoes a transformation as she manifests as a pinnacle of her main spirit. The nature of this manifestation depends on the shaman&#146;s spirit, and is described in its entry.</p>
			<h>Spirit Animal</h>
			<p>By communing with the incredible powers of her spirit, the shaman forges a cherished bond with one specif ic servant of that spirit&#151;known as a spirit animal. A spirit animal is a creature chosen by a shaman to serve as a conduit, allowing her to more fully access the magic of her spirit on a daily basis. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal also grants her special powers. This ability uses the same rules as the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature and is treated as a familiar (see pages 78 and 82 of the Core Rulebook), except as noted below.</p>
			<p>A shaman uses her level as her effective wizard level when determining the abilities of her spirit animal. A shaman can select any familiar available to wizards to serve as her spirit animal, although her spirit animal is augmented by the power of her chosen spirit. Once selected, the spirit animal cannot be changed. Although a shaman&#146;s spirit animal uses the statistics of a specific animal, it is treated as an outsider with the native subtype for the purposes of spells and abilities that affect it.</p>
			<p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack with shaman levels for the purpose of determining any spirit animal abilities that depend on the shaman&#146;s level. If a shaman possesses such levels in other classes, her spirit animal always uses the shaman rules for spirit animals, not those used by familiars of other classes (such as witches, wizards, or sorcerers with the arcane bloodline). If the shaman has witch levels, her spirit animal also serves as the conduit to her patron and stores her witch spells. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal is treated as a familiar for the purposes of all spells, effects, and abilities that affect familiars.</p>
			<p>If a spirit animal is lost or dies, it can be replaced after 24 hours through a special ritual that consumes material components worth 500 gp per shaman level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. The new spirit animal must be of the same sort of creature as the previous one.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman&#146;s spirit animal gains specific abilities, depending upon the type of spirit selected by the shaman using her spirit class feature. These abilities affect the animal&#146;s appearance and grant it special abilities that can aid it in serving the shaman and the spirit it represents and is connected to. These abilities are described in the spirit animal section of each individual spirit description.</p>
			<p><b>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </b>If a shaman is 3rd level or higher, her spirit animal can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the shaman and the spirit animal are in contact at the time the shaman casts a touch spell, she can designate her animal as the &#147;toucher.&#148; The spirit animal can then deliver the touch spell just as the shaman would. If the shaman casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the shaman activates a hex, her spirit animal can be used to make the touch; she doesn&#146;t have to be in contact with the animal to use this ability with hexes.</p>

					<p>At 1st level, a shaman forms a close bond with a spirit animal tied to her chosen spirit. This animal is her conduit to the spirit world, guiding her along the path to enlightenment. The animal also aids a shaman by granting her a special ability. See the Spirit Animal section on page 47.</p>
					<p>A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells. While the spirit animal does not store the spells like a witch&#146;s familiar does, the spirit animal serves as her conduit to divine power. If a shaman&#146;s spirit animal is slain, she cannot prepare new spells or use her spirit magic class feature until the spirit animal is replaced.</p>

					<p>A shaman can spontaneously cast a limited number of spells per day beyond those she prepared ahead of time. She has one spell slot per day of each shaman spell level she can cast, not including orisons. She can choose these spells from the list of spells granted by her spirits (see the spirit class feature and the wandering spirit class feature) at the time she casts them. She can enhance these spells using any metamagic feat that she knows, using up a higher-level spell slot as required by the feat and increasing the time to cast the spell (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Crystal tenders are most often found among subterranean races and races bearing a strong connection to the earth. A crystal tender focuses on the spirits of metal and stone, using crystals as a means to focus the power of the spirits she venerates. Many crystal tenders take it upon themselves to guard rich gem veins and other mineral treasures from those who would mine them out of greed, much in the way that surface-dwelling druids might defend a sacred grove from woodcutters.</i></p>
			<p><i>The crystal tenders of Orv meditate within the Crystal Womb, often near the churning vortex that makes up the heart of the Vault. They learn to focus the cavern&#146;s energies through ley lines in the stone, and they study the birth of crystals within the Womb in order to mimic the process.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>While some heroes speak to gods or consort with otherworldly muses, shamans commune with the spirits of the world and the energies that exist in every living thing. These divine adventurers draw upon their power to shape the world and expand the inf luence of their spiritual patrons. Shamans have strong ties to natural spirits. They form powerful bonds with particular spirits, and as their power grows they learn to call upon other spirits in times of need.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Shamans make for potent divine spellcasters, capable of using divine spells and the power of their spirits to aid their allies and destroy their foes. While they aren&#146;t the healers that clerics are, they can still fill that role when needed.</p>

			<p><b>Spells: </b>A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the shaman spell list. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;9. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1&#150;3 in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Shamans can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;9. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Scion of the Stones (Ex): </b>A crystal tender forms a mystic connection with the precious stones and gems she has sworn to protect. Her spirit animal always appears to be composed of a crystalline substance and gains a +2 bonus to its natural armor. Her spirit animal is treated as an outsider with both the earth and native subtypes, and counts as a crystalline creature for the purposes of spells and abilities. The unique nature of her spirit animal increases the cost of replacing it to 750 gp per shaman level.</p>
			<p>This alters spirit animal.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit (Su): </b>A shaman forms a mystical bond with the spirits of the world. She forms a lasting bond with a single spirit (see Spirits on page 37), which grants a number of abilities and defines many of her other class features.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a shaman gains the spirit ability granted by her chosen spirit. She adds the spells granted by that spirit to the list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She also adds the hexes possessed by that spirit to the list of hexes that she can use with the hex and wandering hex class features.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her selected spirit. At 16th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed for the true version of her selected spirit.</p>
			<p>If the shaman takes levels in another class that grants a mystery (such as the oracle), the spirit and mystery must match, even if that means one of them must change. Subject to GM discretion, the shaman can change her former mystery or spirit to make them conform.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman forms a close bond with a spirit animal tied to her chosen spirit. This animal is her conduit to the spirit world, guiding her along the path to enlightenment. The animal also aids a shaman by granting her a special ability. See the Spirit Animal section on page 47.</p>
			<p>A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells. While the spirit animal does not store the spells like a witch&#146;s familiar does, the spirit animal serves as her conduit to divine power. If a shaman&#146;s spirit animal is slain, she cannot prepare new spells or use her spirit magic class feature until the spirit animal is replaced.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Magic: </b>A shaman can spontaneously cast a limited number of spells per day beyond those she prepared ahead of time. She has one spell slot per day of each shaman spell level she can cast, not including orisons. She can choose these spells from the list of spells granted by her spirits (see the spirit class feature and the wandering spirit class feature) at the time she casts them. She can enhance these spells using any metamagic feat that she knows, using up a higher-level spell slot as required by the feat and increasing the time to cast the spell (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a shaman learns one hex. At 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.</p>
			<p>Using a hex is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Reciprocal Resonance (Su): </b>At 4th level, a crystal tender learns to form a temporary bond with a spirit of crystal. When selecting her wandering spirit, she can forgo gaining a spirit ability to instead grant herself and her spirit animal DR 1/adamantine as long as they&#146;re within 10 feet of one another. While benefiting from this ability, the crystal tender&#146;s skin takes on a crystalline sheen. The DR gained from this ability increases to 2/ adamantine at 8th level, 3/adamantine at 12th level, 4/adamantine at 16th level, and 5/adamantine at 20th level.</p>
			<p>This alters wandering spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Spirit (Su): </b>At 4th level, a shaman can form a temporary bond with a spirit other than the one selected using her spirit class feature. She must make this selection each day when preparing her spells. While this feature is active, she gains the spirit ability granted by the spirit. She also adds the spells granted by that spirit to her list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She does not add the hexes from her wandering spirit to her list of hexes that she can choose from with the hex class feature. At 12th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit. At 20th level, she gains the ability listed in the true version of her wandering spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Hex: </b>At 6th level, a shaman can temporarily gain the use of one of the hexes possessed by either one of her spirits. She must make this selection each day when she prepares her spells. For the purposes of this ability, she can select any hex possessed by her spirit or wandering spirit. If she selects it from her wandering spirit, she loses the hex immediately if she bonds with another spirit, although she can then select a different hex to gain using this ability, from either her spirit or her new wandering spirit. At 14th level, a shaman can select two wandering hexes each day instead of one. This ability otherwise functions as the hex class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Invoke Latent Facets (Su): </b>At 8th level, both a crystal tender and her spirit animal gain all of the benefits of any ioun stones worn by one another, as long as they&#146;re within 100 feet of each other. The crystal tender&#146;s spirit animal can also embed a number of ioun stones equal to the crystal tender&#146;s Charisma modifier into its crystalline form. Embedded ioun stones don&#146;t gain any additional abilities, save that they don&#146;t orbit the spirit animal and can&#146;t be separately targeted. A slain or unconscious spirit animal immediately loses all embedded ioun stones, which tumble to the ground beside its body.</p>
			<p>This replaces the shaman hex gained at 8th level.</p>
			<p><b>Cabochon Form (Sp): </b>At 20th level, as a standard action, a crystal tender can transform her body into a living gemstone as per iron body with a duration of 12 hours. Instead of being vulnerable to effects that can harm an iron golem while in this form, she is vulnerable to effects that can harm a crystalline creature (such as shatter). She can use this ability once per day.</p>
			<p>This replaces manifestation.</p>
			<h>Spirit Animal</h>
			<p>By communing with the incredible powers of her spirit, the shaman forges a cherished bond with one specif ic servant of that spirit&#151;known as a spirit animal. A spirit animal is a creature chosen by a shaman to serve as a conduit, allowing her to more fully access the magic of her spirit on a daily basis. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal also grants her special powers. This ability uses the same rules as the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature and is treated as a familiar (see pages 78 and 82 of the Core Rulebook), except as noted below.</p>
			<p>A shaman uses her level as her effective wizard level when determining the abilities of her spirit animal. A shaman can select any familiar available to wizards to serve as her spirit animal, although her spirit animal is augmented by the power of her chosen spirit. Once selected, the spirit animal cannot be changed. Although a shaman&#146;s spirit animal uses the statistics of a specific animal, it is treated as an outsider with the native subtype for the purposes of spells and abilities that affect it.</p>
			<p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack with shaman levels for the purpose of determining any spirit animal abilities that depend on the shaman&#146;s level. If a shaman possesses such levels in other classes, her spirit animal always uses the shaman rules for spirit animals, not those used by familiars of other classes (such as witches, wizards, or sorcerers with the arcane bloodline). If the shaman has witch levels, her spirit animal also serves as the conduit to her patron and stores her witch spells. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal is treated as a familiar for the purposes of all spells, effects, and abilities that affect familiars.</p>
			<p>If a spirit animal is lost or dies, it can be replaced after 24 hours through a special ritual that consumes material components worth 500 gp per shaman level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. The new spirit animal must be of the same sort of creature as the previous one.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman&#146;s spirit animal gains specific abilities, depending upon the type of spirit selected by the shaman using her spirit class feature. These abilities affect the animal&#146;s appearance and grant it special abilities that can aid it in serving the shaman and the spirit it represents and is connected to. These abilities are described in the spirit animal section of each individual spirit description.</p>
			<p><b>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </b>If a shaman is 3rd level or higher, her spirit animal can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the shaman and the spirit animal are in contact at the time the shaman casts a touch spell, she can designate her animal as the &#147;toucher.&#148; The spirit animal can then deliver the touch spell just as the shaman would. If the shaman casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the shaman activates a hex, her spirit animal can be used to make the touch; she doesn&#146;t have to be in contact with the animal to use this ability with hexes.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Though most shamans dole out banes and boons equally, a benefactor seeks to improve the lives of others by primarily offering powerful supportive abilities and magic to her allies and others she deems worthy.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>While some heroes speak to gods or consort with otherworldly muses, shamans commune with the spirits of the world and the energies that exist in every living thing. These divine adventurers draw upon their power to shape the world and expand the inf luence of their spiritual patrons. Shamans have strong ties to natural spirits. They form powerful bonds with particular spirits, and as their power grows they learn to call upon other spirits in times of need.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Shamans make for potent divine spellcasters, capable of using divine spells and the power of their spirits to aid their allies and destroy their foes. While they aren&#146;t the healers that clerics are, they can still fill that role when needed.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p>P <b>arent Class(es): </b>Oracle and witch.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shaman's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), and Survival (Wis).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>A shaman is proficient with all simple weapons, and with light and medium armor.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the shaman spell list. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;9. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1&#150;3 in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Shamans can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;9. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit (Su): </b>A shaman forms a mystical bond with the spirits of the world. She forms a lasting bond with a single spirit (see Spirits on page 37), which grants a number of abilities and defines many of her other class features.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a shaman gains the spirit ability granted by her chosen spirit. She adds the spells granted by that spirit to the list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She also adds the hexes possessed by that spirit to the list of hexes that she can use with the hex and wandering hex class features.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her selected spirit. At 16th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed for the true version of her selected spirit.</p>
			<p>If the shaman takes levels in another class that grants a mystery (such as the oracle), the spirit and mystery must match, even if that means one of them must change. Subject to GM discretion, the shaman can change her former mystery or spirit to make them conform.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman forms a close bond with a spirit animal tied to her chosen spirit. This animal is her conduit to the spirit world, guiding her along the path to enlightenment. The animal also aids a shaman by granting her a special ability. See the Spirit Animal section on page 47.</p>
			<p>A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells. While the spirit animal does not store the spells like a witch&#146;s familiar does, the spirit animal serves as her conduit to divine power. If a shaman&#146;s spirit animal is slain, she cannot prepare new spells or use her spirit magic class feature until the spirit animal is replaced.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Magic: </b>A shaman can spontaneously cast a limited number of spells per day beyond those she prepared ahead of time. She has one spell slot per day of each shaman spell level she can cast, not including orisons. She can choose these spells from the list of spells granted by her spirits (see the spirit class feature and the wandering spirit class feature) at the time she casts them. She can enhance these spells using any metamagic feat that she knows, using up a higher-level spell slot as required by the feat and increasing the time to cast the spell (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a shaman learns one hex. At 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.</p>
			<p>Using a hex is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Spirit (Su): </b>At 4th level, a shaman can form a temporary bond with a spirit other than the one selected using her spirit class feature. She must make this selection each day when preparing her spells. While this feature is active, she gains the spirit ability granted by the spirit. She also adds the spells granted by that spirit to her list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She does not add the hexes from her wandering spirit to her list of hexes that she can choose from with the hex class feature. At 12th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit. At 20th level, she gains the ability listed in the true version of her wandering spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Hex: </b>At 6th level, a shaman can temporarily gain the use of one of the hexes possessed by either one of her spirits. She must make this selection each day when she prepares her spells. For the purposes of this ability, she can select any hex possessed by her spirit or wandering spirit. If she selects it from her wandering spirit, she loses the hex immediately if she bonds with another spirit, although she can then select a different hex to gain using this ability, from either her spirit or her new wandering spirit. At 14th level, a shaman can select two wandering hexes each day instead of one. This ability otherwise functions as the hex class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Manifestation (Su): </b>Upon reaching 20th level, a shaman undergoes a transformation as she manifests as a pinnacle of her main spirit. The nature of this manifestation depends on the shaman&#146;s spirit, and is described in its entry.</p>
			<h>Spirit Animal</h>
			<p>By communing with the incredible powers of her spirit, the shaman forges a cherished bond with one specif ic servant of that spirit&#151;known as a spirit animal. A spirit animal is a creature chosen by a shaman to serve as a conduit, allowing her to more fully access the magic of her spirit on a daily basis. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal also grants her special powers. This ability uses the same rules as the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature and is treated as a familiar (see pages 78 and 82 of the Core Rulebook), except as noted below.</p>
			<p>A shaman uses her level as her effective wizard level when determining the abilities of her spirit animal. A shaman can select any familiar available to wizards to serve as her spirit animal, although her spirit animal is augmented by the power of her chosen spirit. Once selected, the spirit animal cannot be changed. Although a shaman&#146;s spirit animal uses the statistics of a specific animal, it is treated as an outsider with the native subtype for the purposes of spells and abilities that affect it.</p>
			<p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack with shaman levels for the purpose of determining any spirit animal abilities that depend on the shaman&#146;s level. If a shaman possesses such levels in other classes, her spirit animal always uses the shaman rules for spirit animals, not those used by familiars of other classes (such as witches, wizards, or sorcerers with the arcane bloodline). If the shaman has witch levels, her spirit animal also serves as the conduit to her patron and stores her witch spells. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal is treated as a familiar for the purposes of all spells, effects, and abilities that affect familiars.</p>
			<p>If a spirit animal is lost or dies, it can be replaced after 24 hours through a special ritual that consumes material components worth 500 gp per shaman level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. The new spirit animal must be of the same sort of creature as the previous one.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman&#146;s spirit animal gains specific abilities, depending upon the type of spirit selected by the shaman using her spirit class feature. These abilities affect the animal&#146;s appearance and grant it special abilities that can aid it in serving the shaman and the spirit it represents and is connected to. These abilities are described in the spirit animal section of each individual spirit description.</p>
			<p><b>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </b>If a shaman is 3rd level or higher, her spirit animal can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the shaman and the spirit animal are in contact at the time the shaman casts a touch spell, she can designate her animal as the &#147;toucher.&#148; The spirit animal can then deliver the touch spell just as the shaman would. If the shaman casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the shaman activates a hex, her spirit animal can be used to make the touch; she doesn&#146;t have to be in contact with the animal to use this ability with hexes.</p>

				<name type="string">Wrangle Condition</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 2nd level, the animist interacts directly with unwholesome spirits of the ills that trouble him or his people. To the animist, negative conditions manifest as anthropomorphic spirits or are caused by such spirits (visited upon the creature by bad magic). Either way, the animist can attempt to persuade the spirit to leave its victim alone, thus performing a miraculous healing. As the animist grows in power, he can simply inform these spirits that they are unwelcome and command them to depart.</p>
					<p>The animist can attempt a Diplomacy check to persuade the condition&#146;s spirit to leave. Conditions the animist can affect are ranked from minor to dire, with each category having an accompanying Diplomacy DC (see below). The animist cannot take 10 or 20 on the check or receive aid from any creature except another shaman. Failure by 5 or less means the condition spirit is willing to leave the target and transfer to the animist for the rest of the duration or until cured; this happens only if the animist is willing. Failure by 10 or more means that not only is the target inflicted with the condition, but the animist is as well (whether or not he is willing) for the remaining duration or until cured.</p>
					<p><i>Minor Conditions (DC 15): </i>Fatigued, shaken, and sickened.</p>
					<p><i>Major Conditions (DC 20): </i>Dazed and staggered.</p>
					<p><i>Severe Conditions (DC 25): </i>Exhausted, frightened, and nauseated.</p>
					<p><i>Dire Conditions (DC 30): </i>Blinded, deafened, paralyzed, and stunned.</p>
					<p>The animist can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 his shaman level + his Wisdom modifier. Using this ability is a standard action that requires no contact or shared language with the target, but it relies on audible components and the target must be within 30 feet. If a target is afflicted with multiple conditions, the animist targets one condition at a time (of her choosing). The animist cannot use this ability on himself.</p>
					<p>At 5th level, the animist can use this ability to exorcise minor conditions without needing to attempt a Diplomacy check. He can dispatch major conditions without a roll at 9th level, severe conditions at 13th level, and dire conditions at 17th level. Doing so still requires one use of this ability per condition.</p>

					<p>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a shaman learns one hex. At 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.</p>
					<p>Using a hex is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>

					<p>At 8th level, the animist can attempt to end effects that control a creature or object, such as magic jar, possess objectUM, dominate person, and dominate monster, or possessing entities such as ghosts. This is a full-round action that requires the animist to touch the target. The possessing or dominating creature must attempt a Will save with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman level + her Wisdom modifier. Failure means that the controlling effect ends or the entity is immediately cast out of the target, as appropriate. If the possessing entity is exorcised, it cannot attempt to dominate or possess that target again for 24 hours. The animist can exorcise the same entity out of different targets, but once the entity successfully saves against the animist&#146;s exorcism, it cannot be affected by this ability again for 24 hours.

					<p>At 10th level, the animist can attempt to possess creatures or objects as magic jar or possess objectUM. When the animist is attempting to possess the creature, his familiar acts as the jar and must be within 10 feet when the animist attempts to possess a creature. The animist&#146;s soul can perceive his surroundings through the familiar&#146;s senses, clearly evaluate potential targets for possession, and communicate with his familiar telepathically. The familiar retains its autonomy while acting as the jar, and is not harmed by being used as a vessel for the animist&#146;s soul. The animist can use this ability once per day at 10th level, plus an additional time per day every 4 levels thereafter. This ability replaces the hex gained at 10th level.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Even among mystical practitioners, the animist has a strange perspective and even stranger magic. The animist perceives that all things have a spirit, including objects, constructs, illnesses, buildings, and the environment.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>While some heroes speak to gods or consort with otherworldly muses, shamans commune with the spirits of the world and the energies that exist in every living thing. These divine adventurers draw upon their power to shape the world and expand the inf luence of their spiritual patrons. Shamans have strong ties to natural spirits. They form powerful bonds with particular spirits, and as their power grows they learn to call upon other spirits in times of need.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Shamans make for potent divine spellcasters, capable of using divine spells and the power of their spirits to aid their allies and destroy their foes. While they aren&#146;t the healers that clerics are, they can still fill that role when needed.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p>P <b>arent Class(es): </b>Oracle and witch.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shaman's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), and Survival (Wis).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>A shaman is proficient with all simple weapons, and with light and medium armor.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the shaman spell list. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;9. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1&#150;3 in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>
			<p><b>Animist Spirit Magic: </b>The animist adds the following spells to the list of spells he can cast using spirit magic: speak with animals (1st), skinsendUM (2nd), speak with plants (3rd), malfunctionUM (4th), dream (5th), speak with stone (6th), control constructUM (7th), trap the soul (8th), soul bind (9th). This ability replaces the spirit magic spells gained from the shaman&#146;s spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Shamans can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;9. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit (Su): </b>A shaman forms a mystical bond with the spirits of the world. She forms a lasting bond with a single spirit (see Spirits on page 37), which grants a number of abilities and defines many of her other class features.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a shaman gains the spirit ability granted by her chosen spirit. She adds the spells granted by that spirit to the list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She also adds the hexes possessed by that spirit to the list of hexes that she can use with the hex and wandering hex class features.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her selected spirit. At 16th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed for the true version of her selected spirit.</p>
			<p>If the shaman takes levels in another class that grants a mystery (such as the oracle), the spirit and mystery must match, even if that means one of them must change. Subject to GM discretion, the shaman can change her former mystery or spirit to make them conform.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman forms a close bond with a spirit animal tied to her chosen spirit. This animal is her conduit to the spirit world, guiding her along the path to enlightenment. The animal also aids a shaman by granting her a special ability. See the Spirit Animal section on page 47.</p>
			<p>A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells. While the spirit animal does not store the spells like a witch&#146;s familiar does, the spirit animal serves as her conduit to divine power. If a shaman&#146;s spirit animal is slain, she cannot prepare new spells or use her spirit magic class feature until the spirit animal is replaced.</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a shaman learns one hex. At 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.</p>
			<p>Using a hex is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Wrangle Condition (Su): </b>At 2nd level, the animist interacts directly with unwholesome spirits of the ills that trouble him or his people. To the animist, negative conditions manifest as anthropomorphic spirits or are caused by such spirits (visited upon the creature by bad magic). Either way, the animist can attempt to persuade the spirit to leave its victim alone, thus performing a miraculous healing. As the animist grows in power, he can simply inform these spirits that they are unwelcome and command them to depart.</p>
			<p>The animist can attempt a Diplomacy check to persuade the condition&#146;s spirit to leave. Conditions the animist can affect are ranked from minor to dire, with each category having an accompanying Diplomacy DC (see below). The animist cannot take 10 or 20 on the check or receive aid from any creature except another shaman. Failure by 5 or less means the condition spirit is willing to leave the target and transfer to the animist for the rest of the duration or until cured; this happens only if the animist is willing. Failure by 10 or more means that not only is the target inflicted with the condition, but the animist is as well (whether or not he is willing) for the remaining duration or until cured.</p>
			<p>Minor Conditions (DC 15): Fatigued, shaken, and sickened.</p>
			<p>Major Conditions (DC 20): Dazed and staggered.</p>
			<p>Severe Conditions (DC 25): Exhausted, frightened, and nauseated.</p>
			<p>Dire Conditions (DC 30): Blinded, deafened, paralyzed, and stunned.</p>
			<p>The animist can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 his shaman level + his Wisdom modifier. Using this ability is a standard action that requires no contact or shared language with the target, but it relies on audible components and the target must be within 30 feet. If a target is afflicted with multiple conditions, the animist targets one condition at a time (of her choosing). The animist cannot use this ability on himself.</p>
			<p>At 5th level, the animist can use this ability to exorcise minor conditions without needing to attempt a Diplomacy check. He can dispatch major conditions without a roll at 9th level, severe conditions at 13th level, and dire conditions at 17th level. Doing so still requires one use of this ability per condition.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the hex gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Spirit (Su): </b>At 4th level, a shaman can form a temporary bond with a spirit other than the one selected using her spirit class feature. She must make this selection each day when preparing her spells. While this feature is active, she gains the spirit ability granted by the spirit. She also adds the spells granted by that spirit to her list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She does not add the hexes from her wandering spirit to her list of hexes that she can choose from with the hex class feature. At 12th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit. At 20th level, she gains the ability listed in the true version of her wandering spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Hex: </b>At 6th level, a shaman can temporarily gain the use of one of the hexes possessed by either one of her spirits. She must make this selection each day when she prepares her spells. For the purposes of this ability, she can select any hex possessed by her spirit or wandering spirit. If she selects it from her wandering spirit, she loses the hex immediately if she bonds with another spirit, although she can then select a different hex to gain using this ability, from either her spirit or her new wandering spirit. At 14th level, a shaman can select two wandering hexes each day instead of one. This ability otherwise functions as the hex class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Exorcism (Su): </b>At 8th level, the animist can attempt to end effects that control a creature or object, such as magic jar, possess objectUM, dominate person, and dominate monster, or possessing entities such as ghosts. This is a full-round action that requires the animist to touch the target. The possessing or dominating creature must attempt a Will save with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman level + her Wisdom modifier. Failure means that the controlling effect ends or the entity is immediately cast out of the target, as appropriate. If the possessing entity is exorcised, it cannot attempt to dominate or possess that target again for 24 hours. The animist can exorcise the same entity out of different targets, but once the entity successfully saves against the animist&#146;s exorcism, it cannot be affected by this ability again for 24 hours. This ability replaces the hex gained at 8th level.</p>
			<p><b>Dominate Spirit (Sp): </b>At 10th level, the animist can attempt to possess creatures or objects as magic jar or possess objectUM. When the animist is attempting to possess the creature, his familiar acts as the jar and must be within 10 feet when the animist attempts to possess a creature. The animist&#146;s soul can perceive his surroundings through the familiar&#146;s senses, clearly evaluate potential targets for possession, and communicate with his familiar telepathically. The familiar retains its autonomy while acting as the jar, and is not harmed by being used as a vessel for the animist&#146;s soul. The animist can use this ability once per day at 10th level, plus an additional time per day every 4 levels thereafter. This ability replaces the hex gained at 10th level.</p>
			<p><b>Contact with the Spirit World (Su): </b>At 12th level, the shaman can interact with incorporeal entities as if his unarmed strikes and melee weapons had the ghost touch weapon special ability. While using this ability, he can also see nearby ethereal entities and likewise strike at them as if they were incorporeal. He can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his shaman level. The rounds need not be consecutive. This ability replaces the hex gained at 12th level.</p>
			<p><b>Etherealness (Sp) </b>: At 18th level, the animist can cast etherealness once per day as a spell-like ability. This ability replaces the hex gained at 18th level.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Shaman (Sp): </b>At 20th level, the animist can use ethereal jaunt as at will as a spell-like ability, and cast astral projection once per day as a spell-like ability. This ability replaces manifestation.</p>
			<h>Spirit Animal</h>
			<p>By communing with the incredible powers of her spirit, the shaman forges a cherished bond with one specif ic servant of that spirit&#151;known as a spirit animal. A spirit animal is a creature chosen by a shaman to serve as a conduit, allowing her to more fully access the magic of her spirit on a daily basis. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal also grants her special powers. This ability uses the same rules as the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature and is treated as a familiar (see pages 78 and 82 of the Core Rulebook), except as noted below.</p>
			<p>A shaman uses her level as her effective wizard level when determining the abilities of her spirit animal. A shaman can select any familiar available to wizards to serve as her spirit animal, although her spirit animal is augmented by the power of her chosen spirit. Once selected, the spirit animal cannot be changed. Although a shaman&#146;s spirit animal uses the statistics of a specific animal, it is treated as an outsider with the native subtype for the purposes of spells and abilities that affect it.</p>
			<p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack with shaman levels for the purpose of determining any spirit animal abilities that depend on the shaman&#146;s level. If a shaman possesses such levels in other classes, her spirit animal always uses the shaman rules for spirit animals, not those used by familiars of other classes (such as witches, wizards, or sorcerers with the arcane bloodline). If the shaman has witch levels, her spirit animal also serves as the conduit to her patron and stores her witch spells. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal is treated as a familiar for the purposes of all spells, effects, and abilities that affect familiars.</p>
			<p>If a spirit animal is lost or dies, it can be replaced after 24 hours through a special ritual that consumes material components worth 500 gp per shaman level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. The new spirit animal must be of the same sort of creature as the previous one.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman&#146;s spirit animal gains specific abilities, depending upon the type of spirit selected by the shaman using her spirit class feature. These abilities affect the animal&#146;s appearance and grant it special abilities that can aid it in serving the shaman and the spirit it represents and is connected to. These abilities are described in the spirit animal section of each individual spirit description.</p>
			<p><b>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </b>If a shaman is 3rd level or higher, her spirit animal can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the shaman and the spirit animal are in contact at the time the shaman casts a touch spell, she can designate her animal as the &#147;toucher.&#148; The spirit animal can then deliver the touch spell just as the shaman would. If the shaman casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the shaman activates a hex, her spirit animal can be used to make the touch; she doesn&#146;t have to be in contact with the animal to use this ability with hexes.</p>

					<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;9. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1&#150;3 in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>

					<p>A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells.

					<p>A shaman can spontaneously cast a limited number of spells per day beyond those she prepared ahead of time. She has one spell slot per day of each shaman spell level she can cast, not including orisons. She can choose these spells from the list of spells granted by her spirits (see the spirit class feature and the wandering spirit class feature) at the time she casts them. She can enhance these spells using any metamagic feat that she knows, using up a higher-level spell slot as required by the feat and increasing the time to cast the spell (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>-</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>While some heroes speak to gods or consort with otherworldly muses, shamans commune with the spirits of the world and the energies that exist in every living thing. These divine adventurers draw upon their power to shape the world and expand the inf luence of their spiritual patrons. Shamans have strong ties to natural spirits. They form powerful bonds with particular spirits, and as their power grows they learn to call upon other spirits in times of need.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Shamans make for potent divine spellcasters, capable of using divine spells and the power of their spirits to aid their allies and destroy their foes. While they aren&#146;t the healers that clerics are, they can still fill that role when needed.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>A shaman is proficient with all simple weapons, and with light and medium armor.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the shaman spell list. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;9. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1&#150;3 in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Shamans can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;9. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit (Su): </b>A shaman forms a mystical bond with the spirits of the world. She forms a lasting bond with a single spirit (see Spirits on page 37), which grants a number of abilities and defines many of her other class features.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a shaman gains the spirit ability granted by her chosen spirit. She adds the spells granted by that spirit to the list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She also adds the hexes possessed by that spirit to the list of hexes that she can use with the hex and wandering hex class features.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her selected spirit. At 16th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed for the true version of her selected spirit.</p>
			<p>If the shaman takes levels in another class that grants a mystery (such as the oracle), the spirit and mystery must match, even if that means one of them must change. Subject to GM discretion, the shaman can change her former mystery or spirit to make them conform.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman forms a close bond with a spirit animal tied to her chosen spirit. This animal is her conduit to the spirit world, guiding her along the path to enlightenment. The animal also aids a shaman by granting her a special ability. See the Spirit Animal section on page 47.</p>
			<p>A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells. While the spirit animal does not store the spells like a witch&#146;s familiar does, the spirit animal serves as her conduit to divine power. If a shaman&#146;s spirit animal is slain, she cannot prepare new spells or use her spirit magic class feature until the spirit animal is replaced.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Magic: </b>A shaman can spontaneously cast a limited number of spells per day beyond those she prepared ahead of time. She has one spell slot per day of each shaman spell level she can cast, not including orisons. She can choose these spells from the list of spells granted by her spirits (see the spirit class feature and the wandering spirit class feature) at the time she casts them. She can enhance these spells using any metamagic feat that she knows, using up a higher-level spell slot as required by the feat and increasing the time to cast the spell (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a shaman learns one hex. At 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.</p>
			<p>Using a hex is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Spirit (Su): </b>At 4th level, a shaman can form a temporary bond with a spirit other than the one selected using her spirit class feature. She must make this selection each day when preparing her spells. While this feature is active, she gains the spirit ability granted by the spirit. She also adds the spells granted by that spirit to her list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She does not add the hexes from her wandering spirit to her list of hexes that she can choose from with the hex class feature. At 12th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit. At 20th level, she gains the ability listed in the true version of her wandering spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Hex: </b>At 6th level, a shaman can temporarily gain the use of one of the hexes possessed by either one of her spirits. She must make this selection each day when she prepares her spells. For the purposes of this ability, she can select any hex possessed by her spirit or wandering spirit. If she selects it from her wandering spirit, she loses the hex immediately if she bonds with another spirit, although she can then select a different hex to gain using this ability, from either her spirit or her new wandering spirit. At 14th level, a shaman can select two wandering hexes each day instead of one. This ability otherwise functions as the hex class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Manifestation (Su): </b>Upon reaching 20th level, a shaman undergoes a transformation as she manifests as a pinnacle of her main spirit. The nature of this manifestation depends on the shaman&#146;s spirit, and is described in its entry.</p>
			<h>Spirit Animal</h>
			<p>By communing with the incredible powers of her spirit, the shaman forges a cherished bond with one specif ic servant of that spirit&#151;known as a spirit animal. A spirit animal is a creature chosen by a shaman to serve as a conduit, allowing her to more fully access the magic of her spirit on a daily basis. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal also grants her special powers. This ability uses the same rules as the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature and is treated as a familiar (see pages 78 and 82 of the Core Rulebook), except as noted below.</p>
			<p>A shaman uses her level as her effective wizard level when determining the abilities of her spirit animal. A shaman can select any familiar available to wizards to serve as her spirit animal, although her spirit animal is augmented by the power of her chosen spirit. Once selected, the spirit animal cannot be changed. Although a shaman&#146;s spirit animal uses the statistics of a specific animal, it is treated as an outsider with the native subtype for the purposes of spells and abilities that affect it.</p>
			<p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack with shaman levels for the purpose of determining any spirit animal abilities that depend on the shaman&#146;s level. If a shaman possesses such levels in other classes, her spirit animal always uses the shaman rules for spirit animals, not those used by familiars of other classes (such as witches, wizards, or sorcerers with the arcane bloodline). If the shaman has witch levels, her spirit animal also serves as the conduit to her patron and stores her witch spells. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal is treated as a familiar for the purposes of all spells, effects, and abilities that affect familiars.</p>
			<p>If a spirit animal is lost or dies, it can be replaced after 24 hours through a special ritual that consumes material components worth 500 gp per shaman level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. The new spirit animal must be of the same sort of creature as the previous one.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman&#146;s spirit animal gains specific abilities, depending upon the type of spirit selected by the shaman using her spirit class feature. These abilities affect the animal&#146;s appearance and grant it special abilities that can aid it in serving the shaman and the spirit it represents and is connected to. These abilities are described in the spirit animal section of each individual spirit description.</p>
			<p><b>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </b>If a shaman is 3rd level or higher, her spirit animal can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the shaman and the spirit animal are in contact at the time the shaman casts a touch spell, she can designate her animal as the &#147;toucher.&#148; The spirit animal can then deliver the touch spell just as the shaman would. If the shaman casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the shaman activates a hex, her spirit animal can be used to make the touch; she doesn&#146;t have to be in contact with the animal to use this ability with hexes.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The witch doctor is a healer who specializes in afflictions of the soul. Often misunderstood, she protects her tribe with healing powers, powerful defensive magic, and her own divine &#147;witchcraft.&#148;</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>While some heroes speak to gods or consort with otherworldly muses, shamans commune with the spirits of the world and the energies that exist in every living thing. These divine adventurers draw upon their power to shape the world and expand the inf luence of their spiritual patrons. Shamans have strong ties to natural spirits. They form powerful bonds with particular spirits, and as their power grows they learn to call upon other spirits in times of need.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Shamans make for potent divine spellcasters, capable of using divine spells and the power of their spirits to aid their allies and destroy their foes. While they aren&#146;t the healers that clerics are, they can still fill that role when needed.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>A witch doctor cannot be of evil alignment.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p>P <b>arent Class(es): </b>Oracle and witch.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shaman's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), and Survival (Wis).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>A shaman is proficient with all simple weapons, and with light and medium armor.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the shaman spell list. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;9. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1&#150;3 in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Shamans can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;9. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit (Su): </b>A shaman forms a mystical bond with the spirits of the world. She forms a lasting bond with a single spirit (see Spirits on page 37), which grants a number of abilities and defines many of her other class features.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a shaman gains the spirit ability granted by her chosen spirit. She adds the spells granted by that spirit to the list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She also adds the hexes possessed by that spirit to the list of hexes that she can use with the hex and wandering hex class features.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her selected spirit. At 16th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed for the true version of her selected spirit.</p>
			<p>If the shaman takes levels in another class that grants a mystery (such as the oracle), the spirit and mystery must match, even if that means one of them must change. Subject to GM discretion, the shaman can change her former mystery or spirit to make them conform.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman forms a close bond with a spirit animal tied to her chosen spirit. This animal is her conduit to the spirit world, guiding her along the path to enlightenment. The animal also aids a shaman by granting her a special ability. See the Spirit Animal section on page 47.</p>
			<p>A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells. While the spirit animal does not store the spells like a witch&#146;s familiar does, the spirit animal serves as her conduit to divine power. If a shaman&#146;s spirit animal is slain, she cannot prepare new spells or use her spirit magic class feature until the spirit animal is replaced.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Magic: </b>A shaman can spontaneously cast a limited number of spells per day beyond those she prepared ahead of time. She has one spell slot per day of each shaman spell level she can cast, not including orisons. She can choose these spells from the list of spells granted by her spirits (see the spirit class feature and the wandering spirit class feature) at the time she casts them. She can enhance these spells using any metamagic feat that she knows, using up a higher-level spell slot as required by the feat and increasing the time to cast the spell (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a shaman learns one hex. At 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.</p>
			<p>Using a hex is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Channel Energy (Su): </b>At 4th level, the witch doctor can draw transcendental energies to her location, flooding it with positive energy as the cleric class feature. The witch doctor uses her shaman level &#150; 3 as her effective cleric level, and can channel energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. This is a separate pool of channel energy that does not stack with the life spirit's channel spirit ability. This ability replaces the hexes gained at 4th and 12th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Spirit (Su): </b>At 4th level, a shaman can form a temporary bond with a spirit other than the one selected using her spirit class feature. She must make this selection each day when preparing her spells. While this feature is active, she gains the spirit ability granted by the spirit. She also adds the spells granted by that spirit to her list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She does not add the hexes from her wandering spirit to her list of hexes that she can choose from with the hex class feature. At 12th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit. At 20th level, she gains the ability listed in the true version of her wandering spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Hex: </b>At 6th level, a shaman can temporarily gain the use of one of the hexes possessed by either one of her spirits. She must make this selection each day when she prepares her spells. For the purposes of this ability, she can select any hex possessed by her spirit or wandering spirit. If she selects it from her wandering spirit, she loses the hex immediately if she bonds with another spirit, although she can then select a different hex to gain using this ability, from either her spirit or her new wandering spirit. At 14th level, a shaman can select two wandering hexes each day instead of one. This ability otherwise functions as the hex class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Counter Curse (Su): </b>At 8th level, the witch doctor can choose to lose any prepared spirit magic spell that is 3rd level or higher in order to spontaneously cast dispel magic or remove curse. This ability can only target a spell effect that is on an ally (including herself ). If she forfeits a spirit magic spell higher than 3rd level, she gains a +2 sacred bonus on her caster level check to dispel the spell or to remove the curse for every spell level higher than 3rd that she sacrifices. This ability replaces the hex gained at 8th level.</p>
			<p><b>Countering Hex (Su): </b>At 10th level, the witch doctor can use her hex magic to counterspell as a readied action as dispel magic instead. She must succeed at a dispel check (1d20 + her shaman level) with a DC equal to 11 + the spell&#146;s caster level. If countering hex succeeds, the spell fizzles away and is lost. Failure means the spell is not countered. In either case, the witch doctor cannot attempt to use this hex against any of that caster&#146;s spells again for 24 hours. The witch doctor cannot use countering hex on an ongoing effect, a magic item, or a hex. This ability replaces the hex gained at 10th level.</p>
			<p><b>Manifestation (Su): </b>Upon reaching 20th level, a shaman undergoes a transformation as she manifests as a pinnacle of her main spirit. The nature of this manifestation depends on the shaman&#146;s spirit, and is described in its entry.</p>
			<h>Spirit Animal</h>
			<p>By communing with the incredible powers of her spirit, the shaman forges a cherished bond with one specif ic servant of that spirit&#151;known as a spirit animal. A spirit animal is a creature chosen by a shaman to serve as a conduit, allowing her to more fully access the magic of her spirit on a daily basis. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal also grants her special powers. This ability uses the same rules as the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature and is treated as a familiar (see pages 78 and 82 of the Core Rulebook), except as noted below.</p>
			<p>A shaman uses her level as her effective wizard level when determining the abilities of her spirit animal. A shaman can select any familiar available to wizards to serve as her spirit animal, although her spirit animal is augmented by the power of her chosen spirit. Once selected, the spirit animal cannot be changed. Although a shaman&#146;s spirit animal uses the statistics of a specific animal, it is treated as an outsider with the native subtype for the purposes of spells and abilities that affect it.</p>
			<p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack with shaman levels for the purpose of determining any spirit animal abilities that depend on the shaman&#146;s level. If a shaman possesses such levels in other classes, her spirit animal always uses the shaman rules for spirit animals, not those used by familiars of other classes (such as witches, wizards, or sorcerers with the arcane bloodline). If the shaman has witch levels, her spirit animal also serves as the conduit to her patron and stores her witch spells. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal is treated as a familiar for the purposes of all spells, effects, and abilities that affect familiars.</p>
			<p>If a spirit animal is lost or dies, it can be replaced after 24 hours through a special ritual that consumes material components worth 500 gp per shaman level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. The new spirit animal must be of the same sort of creature as the previous one.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman&#146;s spirit animal gains specific abilities, depending upon the type of spirit selected by the shaman using her spirit class feature. These abilities affect the animal&#146;s appearance and grant it special abilities that can aid it in serving the shaman and the spirit it represents and is connected to. These abilities are described in the spirit animal section of each individual spirit description.</p>
			<p><b>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </b>If a shaman is 3rd level or higher, her spirit animal can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the shaman and the spirit animal are in contact at the time the shaman casts a touch spell, she can designate her animal as the &#147;toucher.&#148; The spirit animal can then deliver the touch spell just as the shaman would. If the shaman casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the shaman activates a hex, her spirit animal can be used to make the touch; she doesn&#146;t have to be in contact with the animal to use this ability with hexes.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The visionary is a master at divination, drawing upon her intimate relationship with the spirit world to ferret out all manner of secrets and insights about the world around her and beyond.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>While some heroes speak to gods or consort with otherworldly muses, shamans commune with the spirits of the world and the energies that exist in every living thing. These divine adventurers draw upon their power to shape the world and expand the inf luence of their spiritual patrons. Shamans have strong ties to natural spirits. They form powerful bonds with particular spirits, and as their power grows they learn to call upon other spirits in times of need.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Shamans make for potent divine spellcasters, capable of using divine spells and the power of their spirits to aid their allies and destroy their foes. While they aren&#146;t the healers that clerics are, they can still fill that role when needed.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p>P <b>arent Class(es): </b>Oracle and witch.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shaman's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), and Survival (Wis).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>A shaman is proficient with all simple weapons, and with light and medium armor.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the shaman spell list. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;9. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1&#150;3 in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Shamans can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;9. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit (Su): </b>A shaman forms a mystical bond with the spirits of the world. She forms a lasting bond with a single spirit (see Spirits on page 37), which grants a number of abilities and defines many of her other class features.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a shaman gains the spirit ability granted by her chosen spirit. She adds the spells granted by that spirit to the list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She also adds the hexes possessed by that spirit to the list of hexes that she can use with the hex and wandering hex class features.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her selected spirit. At 16th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed for the true version of her selected spirit.</p>
			<p>If the shaman takes levels in another class that grants a mystery (such as the oracle), the spirit and mystery must match, even if that means one of them must change. Subject to GM discretion, the shaman can change her former mystery or spirit to make them conform.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman forms a close bond with a spirit animal tied to her chosen spirit. This animal is her conduit to the spirit world, guiding her along the path to enlightenment. The animal also aids a shaman by granting her a special ability. See the Spirit Animal section on page 47.</p>
			<p>A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells. While the spirit animal does not store the spells like a witch&#146;s familiar does, the spirit animal serves as her conduit to divine power. If a shaman&#146;s spirit animal is slain, she cannot prepare new spells or use her spirit magic class feature until the spirit animal is replaced.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Magic: </b>A shaman can spontaneously cast a limited number of spells per day beyond those she prepared ahead of time. She has one spell slot per day of each shaman spell level she can cast, not including orisons. She can choose these spells from the list of spells granted by her spirits (see the spirit class feature and the wandering spirit class feature) at the time she casts them. She can enhance these spells using any metamagic feat that she knows, using up a higher-level spell slot as required by the feat and increasing the time to cast the spell (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a shaman learns one hex. At 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.</p>
			<p>Using a hex is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat: </b>At 4th level, the visionary gains Diviner&#146;s DelvingAPG as a bonus feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites.</p>
			<p><b>Discern Magical Expertise (Ex): </b>At 4th level, the shaman can determine what type of spellcasting expertise a creature possesses by studying the creature for 2 rounds with detect magic or any of the following spells: detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, or detect law (if the creature belongs to the alignment). This ability tells the visionary what bloodlines, domains, hexes, schools, or mysteries (if any) the creature possesses. A successful Will saving throw negates this effect (DC = 10 + 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier). A creature affected by this ability cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours. This ability functions through magical sensors as with clairaudience/clairvoyance and scrying. This ability replaces wandering spirit gained at 4th level.</p>
			<p><b>Vision Spirit Magic: </b>At 4th level, the visionary adds the following spells to the list of spells she can cast using spirit magic: see alignmentUC (1st), see invisibility (2nd), clairaudience/clairvoyance (3rd), detect scrying (4th), prying eyes (5th), legend lore (6th), vision (7th), moment of prescience (8th), foresight (9th). This ability replaces the spirit magic spells gained from the shaman&#146;s wandering spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Divination (Su): </b>At 6th level, the visionary becomes more adept at divination magic. When she casts the augury spell, her chance for an accurate answer is automatically the maximum of 90%. Likewise, when she casts divination, she has the maximum 90% chance of an accurate answer.</p>
			<p>Finally, the visionary can prepare scrying as a 4th-level spell, and it requires only 1 minute to cast. The visionary also has a 10% chance per caster level to cast the spells listed in the scrying spell description, instead of 5% per caster level (to a maximum of 100%).</p>
			<p>The visionary must still prepare these spells to receive these benefits. This ability replaces the wandering hex gained at 6th level.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Spirit (Su): </b>At 12th level, the visionary forms a temporary bond with another spirit (other than the one she selected using her spirit class feature). This is identical to the 4th-level shaman class feature. This adds the wandering spirit magic spells to the list of spells she can cast using spirit magic, along with vision spirit magic and her original spirit. At 20th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit. This ability replaces the greater version of wandering spirit gained at 12th level and true version of wandering spirit gained at 20th level.</p>
			<p><b>Manifestation (Su): </b>Upon reaching 20th level, a shaman undergoes a transformation as she manifests as a pinnacle of her main spirit. The nature of this manifestation depends on the shaman&#146;s spirit, and is described in its entry.</p>
			<h>Spirit Animal</h>
			<p>By communing with the incredible powers of her spirit, the shaman forges a cherished bond with one specif ic servant of that spirit&#151;known as a spirit animal. A spirit animal is a creature chosen by a shaman to serve as a conduit, allowing her to more fully access the magic of her spirit on a daily basis. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal also grants her special powers. This ability uses the same rules as the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature and is treated as a familiar (see pages 78 and 82 of the Core Rulebook), except as noted below.</p>
			<p>A shaman uses her level as her effective wizard level when determining the abilities of her spirit animal. A shaman can select any familiar available to wizards to serve as her spirit animal, although her spirit animal is augmented by the power of her chosen spirit. Once selected, the spirit animal cannot be changed. Although a shaman&#146;s spirit animal uses the statistics of a specific animal, it is treated as an outsider with the native subtype for the purposes of spells and abilities that affect it.</p>
			<p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack with shaman levels for the purpose of determining any spirit animal abilities that depend on the shaman&#146;s level. If a shaman possesses such levels in other classes, her spirit animal always uses the shaman rules for spirit animals, not those used by familiars of other classes (such as witches, wizards, or sorcerers with the arcane bloodline). If the shaman has witch levels, her spirit animal also serves as the conduit to her patron and stores her witch spells. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal is treated as a familiar for the purposes of all spells, effects, and abilities that affect familiars.</p>
			<p>If a spirit animal is lost or dies, it can be replaced after 24 hours through a special ritual that consumes material components worth 500 gp per shaman level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. The new spirit animal must be of the same sort of creature as the previous one.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman&#146;s spirit animal gains specific abilities, depending upon the type of spirit selected by the shaman using her spirit class feature. These abilities affect the animal&#146;s appearance and grant it special abilities that can aid it in serving the shaman and the spirit it represents and is connected to. These abilities are described in the spirit animal section of each individual spirit description.</p>
			<p><b>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </b>If a shaman is 3rd level or higher, her spirit animal can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the shaman and the spirit animal are in contact at the time the shaman casts a touch spell, she can designate her animal as the &#147;toucher.&#148; The spirit animal can then deliver the touch spell just as the shaman would. If the shaman casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the shaman activates a hex, her spirit animal can be used to make the touch; she doesn&#146;t have to be in contact with the animal to use this ability with hexes.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>An unsworn shaman never binds herself to one specific spirit, always making new deals as she deems necessary for the circumstances that she finds herself in. While this weakens the powers she can access from any one spirit, it gives her access to a broader overall range of abilities.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>While some heroes speak to gods or consort with otherworldly muses, shamans commune with the spirits of the world and the energies that exist in every living thing. These divine adventurers draw upon their power to shape the world and expand the inf luence of their spiritual patrons. Shamans have strong ties to natural spirits. They form powerful bonds with particular spirits, and as their power grows they learn to call upon other spirits in times of need.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Shamans make for potent divine spellcasters, capable of using divine spells and the power of their spirits to aid their allies and destroy their foes. While they aren&#146;t the healers that clerics are, they can still fill that role when needed.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p>P <b>arent Class(es): </b>Oracle and witch.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shaman's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), and Survival (Wis).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>A shaman is proficient with all simple weapons, and with light and medium armor.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the shaman spell list. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;9. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1&#150;3 in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>
			<p><b>Minor Spirit (Su): </b>At 1st level, the unsworn shaman also forms a temporary bond with a minor spirit each day, granting her access to a shaman or witch hex of her choosing, but not a major hex or a grand hex. She must make this selection each day when she prepares her spells for the day. Until she changes the minor spirit, she continues to have access to the shaman or witch hex. At 2nd level, she can instead select a hex from one of her wandering spirits selected for that day. If she selects a witch hex, she treats her shaman level as her witch level, and uses her Wisdom in place of her Intelligence for the purpose of that hex.</p>
			<p>She can make temporary bonds with two minor spirits (thus gaining two hexes) at 4th level, and with one additional minor spirit (and hex) every 4 levels thereafter. This ability replaces spirit and alters hex.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Shamans can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;9. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman forms a close bond with a spirit animal tied to her chosen spirit. This animal is her conduit to the spirit world, guiding her along the path to enlightenment. The animal also aids a shaman by granting her a special ability. See the Spirit Animal section on page 47.</p>
			<p>A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells. While the spirit animal does not store the spells like a witch&#146;s familiar does, the spirit animal serves as her conduit to divine power. If a shaman&#146;s spirit animal is slain, she cannot prepare new spells or use her spirit magic class feature until the spirit animal is replaced.</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a shaman learns one hex. At 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.</p>
			<p>Using a hex is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Magic: </b>The unsworn shaman gains this ability at 2nd level rather than at 1st. This ability alters spirit magic.A shaman can spontaneously cast a limited number of spells per day beyond those she prepared ahead of time. She has one spell slot per day of each shaman spell level she can cast, not including orisons. She can choose these spells from the list of spells granted by her spirits (see the spirit class feature and the wandering spirit class feature) at the time she casts them. She can enhance these spells using any metamagic feat that she knows, using up a higher-level spell slot as required by the feat and increasing the time to cast the spell (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal: </b>At 2nd level, an unsworn shaman&#146;s spirit animal gains the spirit animal bonus from one of her wandering spirits (see below). This bonus can be changed each day when the shaman prepares spells, but it must correspond to one of the shaman&#146;s wandering spirits. This ability alters spirit animal.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Spirit (Su): </b>At 2nd level, the unsworn shaman gains access to the wandering spirit class feature. At 10th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit. At 18th level, she gains the abilities listed in the true version of her wandering spirit.</p>
			<p>Additionally, at 6th level, she also gains a second wandering spirit, gaining the abilities listed in the greater version of that spirit at 14th level, and the abilities listed in the true version at 20th level. This ability alters wandering spirit and replaces wandering hex.</p>
			<p><b>Manifestation (Su): </b>Upon reaching 20th level, a shaman undergoes a transformation as she manifests as a pinnacle of her main spirit. The nature of this manifestation depends on the shaman&#146;s spirit, and is described in its entry.</p>
			<h>Spirit Animal</h>
			<p>By communing with the incredible powers of her spirit, the shaman forges a cherished bond with one specif ic servant of that spirit&#151;known as a spirit animal. A spirit animal is a creature chosen by a shaman to serve as a conduit, allowing her to more fully access the magic of her spirit on a daily basis. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal also grants her special powers. This ability uses the same rules as the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature and is treated as a familiar (see pages 78 and 82 of the Core Rulebook), except as noted below.</p>
			<p>A shaman uses her level as her effective wizard level when determining the abilities of her spirit animal. A shaman can select any familiar available to wizards to serve as her spirit animal, although her spirit animal is augmented by the power of her chosen spirit. Once selected, the spirit animal cannot be changed. Although a shaman&#146;s spirit animal uses the statistics of a specific animal, it is treated as an outsider with the native subtype for the purposes of spells and abilities that affect it.</p>
			<p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack with shaman levels for the purpose of determining any spirit animal abilities that depend on the shaman&#146;s level. If a shaman possesses such levels in other classes, her spirit animal always uses the shaman rules for spirit animals, not those used by familiars of other classes (such as witches, wizards, or sorcerers with the arcane bloodline). If the shaman has witch levels, her spirit animal also serves as the conduit to her patron and stores her witch spells. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal is treated as a familiar for the purposes of all spells, effects, and abilities that affect familiars.</p>
			<p>If a spirit animal is lost or dies, it can be replaced after 24 hours through a special ritual that consumes material components worth 500 gp per shaman level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. The new spirit animal must be of the same sort of creature as the previous one.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman&#146;s spirit animal gains specific abilities, depending upon the type of spirit selected by the shaman using her spirit class feature. These abilities affect the animal&#146;s appearance and grant it special abilities that can aid it in serving the shaman and the spirit it represents and is connected to. These abilities are described in the spirit animal section of each individual spirit description.</p>
			<p><b>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </b>If a shaman is 3rd level or higher, her spirit animal can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the shaman and the spirit animal are in contact at the time the shaman casts a touch spell, she can designate her animal as the &#147;toucher.&#148; The spirit animal can then deliver the touch spell just as the shaman would. If the shaman casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the shaman activates a hex, her spirit animal can be used to make the touch; she doesn&#146;t have to be in contact with the animal to use this ability with hexes.</p>

					<p>A true silvered throne&#146;s divine magic arises from communion with spirits alongside study of archaic lore compiled into a personal occult grimoire.

By studying his grimoire, a true silvered throne can prepare any spell on the shaman spell list or provided by his spirit. If this grimoire is lost or destroyed, he cannot prepare new spells or use his spirit magic class feature until it is replaced, which requires 1 week of work. This ability replaces spirit animal.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, a shaman can form a temporary bond with a spirit other than the one selected using her spirit class feature. She must make this selection each day when preparing her spells. While this feature is active, she gains the spirit ability granted by the spirit. She also adds the spells granted by that spirit to her list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She does not add the hexes from her wandering spirit to her list of hexes that she can choose from with the hex class feature. At 12th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit. At 20th level, she gains the ability listed in the true version of her wandering spirit.</p>

					<p>At 6th level, a shaman can temporarily gain the use of one of the hexes possessed by either one of her spirits. She must make this selection each day when she prepares her spells. For the purposes of this ability, she can select any hex possessed by her spirit or wandering spirit. If she selects it from her wandering spirit, she loses the hex immediately if she bonds with another spirit, although she can then select a different hex to gain using this ability, from either her spirit or her new wandering spirit. At 14th level, a shaman can select two wandering hexes each day instead of one. This ability otherwise functions as the hex class feature.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Members in good standing who have risen to a prestigious rank within the Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye, true silvered thrones have managed to discover rituals and occult secrets within the lore of their order. They are scholars of ancient mysteries and keepers of forbidden secrets who go beyond simply learning eldritch traditions to make the occult a part of their very souls.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>While some heroes speak to gods or consort with otherworldly muses, shamans commune with the spirits of the world and the energies that exist in every living thing. These divine adventurers draw upon their power to shape the world and expand the inf luence of their spiritual patrons. Shamans have strong ties to natural spirits. They form powerful bonds with particular spirits, and as their power grows they learn to call upon other spirits in times of need.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Shamans make for potent divine spellcasters, capable of using divine spells and the power of their spirits to aid their allies and destroy their foes. While they aren&#146;t the healers that clerics are, they can still fill that role when needed.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p>P <b>arent Class(es): </b>Oracle and witch.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shaman's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Fly (Dex), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>A shaman is proficient with all simple weapons, and with light and medium armor.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the shaman spell list. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;9. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1&#150;3 in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>
			<p><b>Occult Grimoire (Ex): </b>A true silvered throne&#146;s divine magic arises from communion with spirits alongside study of archaic lore compiled into a personal occult grimoire. Unlike a wizard&#146;s spellbook, this grimoire doesn&#146;t contain specific spells. By studying his grimoire, a true silvered throne can prepare any spell on the shaman spell list or provided by his spirit. If this grimoire is lost or destroyed, he cannot prepare new spells or use his spirit magic class feature until it is replaced, which requires 1 week of work. This ability replaces spirit animal.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Shamans can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;9. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Ritual Hex: </b>A true silvered throne gains Ritual Hex (see page 24) as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit (Su): </b>A shaman forms a mystical bond with the spirits of the world. She forms a lasting bond with a single spirit (see Spirits on page 37), which grants a number of abilities and defines many of her other class features.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a shaman gains the spirit ability granted by her chosen spirit. She adds the spells granted by that spirit to the list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She also adds the hexes possessed by that spirit to the list of hexes that she can use with the hex and wandering hex class features.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her selected spirit. At 16th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed for the true version of her selected spirit.</p>
			<p>If the shaman takes levels in another class that grants a mystery (such as the oracle), the spirit and mystery must match, even if that means one of them must change. Subject to GM discretion, the shaman can change her former mystery or spirit to make them conform.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Magic: </b>A shaman can spontaneously cast a limited number of spells per day beyond those she prepared ahead of time. She has one spell slot per day of each shaman spell level she can cast, not including orisons. She can choose these spells from the list of spells granted by her spirits (see the spirit class feature and the wandering spirit class feature) at the time she casts them. She can enhance these spells using any metamagic feat that she knows, using up a higher-level spell slot as required by the feat and increasing the time to cast the spell (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a shaman learns one hex. At 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.</p>
			<p>Using a hex is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Scarab of the Second Throne (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a true silvered throne successfully constructs a golden scarab that is infused with some of his occult potential. Treat this construct as a clockwork spy (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 58), except it has half its master&#146;s total hit points regardless of its Hit Dice and can write and take dictation rather than record audio. If worn in the true silvered throne&#146;s amulet slot, the golden scarab provides a +4 bonus to AC against sneak attacks and attacks of opportunity, as the scarab animates and moves to intercept attacks. If lost or destroyed, the golden scarab can be replaced in a week-long ritual costing 250 gp.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Ritual (Su): </b>At 6th level, a true silvered throne can attempt to coax a nearby spirit into service with a 1-minute-long ritual once per day, gaining that spirit&#146;s spirit ability and adding its list of spells to those he can cast using his spirit magic. The silvered throne can maintain this bond for 1 hour, or until he dismisses the spirit as a free action. At 12th level, he also gains this spirit&#146;s greater spirit power while bonded, and at 20th level gains its true spirit power as well. He can perform a wandering ritual one additional time per day at 8th level and 14th level. This ability replaces wandering spirit and wandering hex.</p>
			<p><b>Esoteric Rites (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a true silvered throne gains a +1 insight bonus on skill checks attempted as part of an occult ritual. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 shaman levels beyond 8th (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level). If the true silvered throne is the ritual&#146;s primary caster, he also adds this bonus to the caster level of the ritual&#146;s effect. This ability replaces the 8th-level hex.</p>
			<p><b>Manifestation (Su): </b>Upon reaching 20th level, a shaman undergoes a transformation as she manifests as a pinnacle of her main spirit. The nature of this manifestation depends on the shaman&#146;s spirit, and is described in its entry.</p>
			<h>Spirit Animal</h>
			<p>By communing with the incredible powers of her spirit, the shaman forges a cherished bond with one specif ic servant of that spirit&#151;known as a spirit animal. A spirit animal is a creature chosen by a shaman to serve as a conduit, allowing her to more fully access the magic of her spirit on a daily basis. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal also grants her special powers. This ability uses the same rules as the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature and is treated as a familiar (see pages 78 and 82 of the Core Rulebook), except as noted below.</p>
			<p>A shaman uses her level as her effective wizard level when determining the abilities of her spirit animal. A shaman can select any familiar available to wizards to serve as her spirit animal, although her spirit animal is augmented by the power of her chosen spirit. Once selected, the spirit animal cannot be changed. Although a shaman&#146;s spirit animal uses the statistics of a specific animal, it is treated as an outsider with the native subtype for the purposes of spells and abilities that affect it.</p>
			<p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack with shaman levels for the purpose of determining any spirit animal abilities that depend on the shaman&#146;s level. If a shaman possesses such levels in other classes, her spirit animal always uses the shaman rules for spirit animals, not those used by familiars of other classes (such as witches, wizards, or sorcerers with the arcane bloodline). If the shaman has witch levels, her spirit animal also serves as the conduit to her patron and stores her witch spells. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal is treated as a familiar for the purposes of all spells, effects, and abilities that affect familiars.</p>
			<p>If a spirit animal is lost or dies, it can be replaced after 24 hours through a special ritual that consumes material components worth 500 gp per shaman level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. The new spirit animal must be of the same sort of creature as the previous one.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman&#146;s spirit animal gains specific abilities, depending upon the type of spirit selected by the shaman using her spirit class feature. These abilities affect the animal&#146;s appearance and grant it special abilities that can aid it in serving the shaman and the spirit it represents and is connected to. These abilities are described in the spirit animal section of each individual spirit description.</p>
			<p><b>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </b>If a shaman is 3rd level or higher, her spirit animal can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the shaman and the spirit animal are in contact at the time the shaman casts a touch spell, she can designate her animal as the &#147;toucher.&#148; The spirit animal can then deliver the touch spell just as the shaman would. If the shaman casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the shaman activates a hex, her spirit animal can be used to make the touch; she doesn&#146;t have to be in contact with the animal to use this ability with hexes.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Not all spirits deserve reverence and respect. Some are twisted and despicable. It&#146;s a spirit warden&#146;s duty to end these spirits&#146; existence.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>While some heroes speak to gods or consort with otherworldly muses, shamans commune with the spirits of the world and the energies that exist in every living thing. These divine adventurers draw upon their power to shape the world and expand the inf luence of their spiritual patrons. Shamans have strong ties to natural spirits. They form powerful bonds with particular spirits, and as their power grows they learn to call upon other spirits in times of need.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Shamans make for potent divine spellcasters, capable of using divine spells and the power of their spirits to aid their allies and destroy their foes. While they aren&#146;t the healers that clerics are, they can still fill that role when needed.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p>P <b>arent Class(es): </b>Oracle and witch.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shaman's class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), and Survival (Wis).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>A shaman is proficient with all simple weapons, and with light and medium armor.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the shaman spell list. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;9. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1&#150;3 in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Shamans can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;9. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Restless Magic (Su): </b>The spirit warden adds the following spells to the list of spells she can cast using spirit magic: detect undead (1st), command undead (2nd), halt undead (3rd), death ward (4th), possess objectUM (5th), undead to death (6th), ethereal jaunt (7th), control undead (8th), foresight (9th). This ability replaces the spirit magic spells gained from the shaman&#146;s spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit (Su): </b>A shaman forms a mystical bond with the spirits of the world. She forms a lasting bond with a single spirit (see Spirits on page 37), which grants a number of abilities and defines many of her other class features.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a shaman gains the spirit ability granted by her chosen spirit. She adds the spells granted by that spirit to the list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She also adds the hexes possessed by that spirit to the list of hexes that she can use with the hex and wandering hex class features.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her selected spirit. At 16th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed for the true version of her selected spirit.</p>
			<p>If the shaman takes levels in another class that grants a mystery (such as the oracle), the spirit and mystery must match, even if that means one of them must change. Subject to GM discretion, the shaman can change her former mystery or spirit to make them conform.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman forms a close bond with a spirit animal tied to her chosen spirit. This animal is her conduit to the spirit world, guiding her along the path to enlightenment. The animal also aids a shaman by granting her a special ability. See the Spirit Animal section on page 47.</p>
			<p>A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells. While the spirit animal does not store the spells like a witch&#146;s familiar does, the spirit animal serves as her conduit to divine power. If a shaman&#146;s spirit animal is slain, she cannot prepare new spells or use her spirit magic class feature until the spirit animal is replaced.</p>
			<p><b>Unnatural Mien (Ex): </b>At 1st level, the spirit warden&#146;s dealings with the spirit world give her an unsettling demeanor. Diplomacy and Handle Animal are not class skills for a spirit warden. Intimidate is added as a class skill, and she gains a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks to demoralize a foe.</p>
			<p><b>Rebuke Spirits (Su): </b>At 2nd level, the spirit warden gains the ability to channel positive energy as a cleric of her level. Regardless of her alignment, she can only use this ability to harm undead creatures. The spirit warden can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. This ability replaces the hex gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 4th level, a shaman learns one hex. At 8th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.</p>
			<p>Using a hex is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Spirit (Su): </b>At 4th level, a shaman can form a temporary bond with a spirit other than the one selected using her spirit class feature. She must make this selection each day when preparing her spells. While this feature is active, she gains the spirit ability granted by the spirit. She also adds the spells granted by that spirit to her list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She does not add the hexes from her wandering spirit to her list of hexes that she can choose from with the hex class feature. At 12th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit. At 20th level, she gains the ability listed in the true version of her wandering spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Hex: </b>At 6th level, a shaman can temporarily gain the use of one of the hexes possessed by either one of her spirits. She must make this selection each day when she prepares her spells. For the purposes of this ability, she can select any hex possessed by her spirit or wandering spirit. If she selects it from her wandering spirit, she loses the hex immediately if she bonds with another spirit, although she can then select a different hex to gain using this ability, from either her spirit or her new wandering spirit. At 14th level, a shaman can select two wandering hexes each day instead of one. This ability otherwise functions as the hex class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Laugh at Death (Su): </b>At 10th level, the spirit warden&#146;s familiarity with the dead has filled her with contempt for death itself. She gains a +4 insight bonus on saving throws against death effects and to avoid or remove negative levels. This ability replaces the hex gained at 10th level.</p>
			<p><b>Manifestation (Su): </b>Upon reaching 20th level, a shaman undergoes a transformation as she manifests as a pinnacle of her main spirit. The nature of this manifestation depends on the shaman&#146;s spirit, and is described in its entry.</p>
			<h>Spirit Animal</h>
			<p>By communing with the incredible powers of her spirit, the shaman forges a cherished bond with one specif ic servant of that spirit&#151;known as a spirit animal. A spirit animal is a creature chosen by a shaman to serve as a conduit, allowing her to more fully access the magic of her spirit on a daily basis. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal also grants her special powers. This ability uses the same rules as the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature and is treated as a familiar (see pages 78 and 82 of the Core Rulebook), except as noted below.</p>
			<p>A shaman uses her level as her effective wizard level when determining the abilities of her spirit animal. A shaman can select any familiar available to wizards to serve as her spirit animal, although her spirit animal is augmented by the power of her chosen spirit. Once selected, the spirit animal cannot be changed. Although a shaman&#146;s spirit animal uses the statistics of a specific animal, it is treated as an outsider with the native subtype for the purposes of spells and abilities that affect it.</p>
			<p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack with shaman levels for the purpose of determining any spirit animal abilities that depend on the shaman&#146;s level. If a shaman possesses such levels in other classes, her spirit animal always uses the shaman rules for spirit animals, not those used by familiars of other classes (such as witches, wizards, or sorcerers with the arcane bloodline). If the shaman has witch levels, her spirit animal also serves as the conduit to her patron and stores her witch spells. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal is treated as a familiar for the purposes of all spells, effects, and abilities that affect familiars.</p>
			<p>If a spirit animal is lost or dies, it can be replaced after 24 hours through a special ritual that consumes material components worth 500 gp per shaman level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. The new spirit animal must be of the same sort of creature as the previous one.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman&#146;s spirit animal gains specific abilities, depending upon the type of spirit selected by the shaman using her spirit class feature. These abilities affect the animal&#146;s appearance and grant it special abilities that can aid it in serving the shaman and the spirit it represents and is connected to. These abilities are described in the spirit animal section of each individual spirit description.</p>
			<p><b>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </b>If a shaman is 3rd level or higher, her spirit animal can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the shaman and the spirit animal are in contact at the time the shaman casts a touch spell, she can designate her animal as the &#147;toucher.&#148; The spirit animal can then deliver the touch spell just as the shaman would. If the shaman casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the shaman activates a hex, her spirit animal can be used to make the touch; she doesn&#146;t have to be in contact with the animal to use this ability with hexes.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>A shaman is proficient with all simple weapons, and with light and medium armor.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the shaman spell list. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;9. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1&#150;3 in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>
			<p><b>Mysteries of the Past: </b>A speaker for the past gains Linguistics, Knowledge (history), Knowledge (local), Perception, and Use Magic Device as class skills. She also adds the spells from the ancestorUM and timeUM oracle mysteries to her class spell list (as the cleric level for those spells).</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the shaman&#146;s familiar. The speaker for the past must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation to regain her daily allotment of spells, but does not need to commune with a familiar during this time. Because she has no familiar, she does not gain a spirit familiar feature from any spirit she bonds with.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Shamans can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;9. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit (Su): </b>A shaman forms a mystical bond with the spirits of the world. She forms a lasting bond with a single spirit (see Spirits on page 37), which grants a number of abilities and defines many of her other class features.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a shaman gains the spirit ability granted by her chosen spirit. She adds the spells granted by that spirit to the list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She also adds the hexes possessed by that spirit to the list of hexes that she can use with the hex and wandering hex class features.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her selected spirit. At 16th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed for the true version of her selected spirit.</p>
			<p>If the shaman takes levels in another class that grants a mystery (such as the oracle), the spirit and mystery must match, even if that means one of them must change. Subject to GM discretion, the shaman can change her former mystery or spirit to make them conform.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Magic: </b>A shaman can spontaneously cast a limited number of spells per day beyond those she prepared ahead of time. She has one spell slot per day of each shaman spell level she can cast, not including orisons. She can choose these spells from the list of spells granted by her spirits (see the spirit class feature and the wandering spirit class feature) at the time she casts them. She can enhance these spells using any metamagic feat that she knows, using up a higher-level spell slot as required by the feat and increasing the time to cast the spell (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a shaman learns one hex. At 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.</p>
			<p>Using a hex is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Revelations of the Past: </b>At 4th, 6th, 12th, 14th, and 20th levels, the speaker for the past can select a revelation from the ancestor or time mysteries. She uses her shaman level as her oracle level for these revelations, and uses her Wisdom modifier in place of her Charisma modifier for the purposes of the revelation. This ability replaces wandering spirit and wandering hex.</p>
			<p><b>Manifestation (Su): </b>Upon reaching 20th level, a shaman undergoes a transformation as she manifests as a pinnacle of her main spirit. The nature of this manifestation depends on the shaman&#146;s spirit, and is described in its entry.</p>
			<h>Spirit Animal</h>
			<p>By communing with the incredible powers of her spirit, the shaman forges a cherished bond with one specif ic servant of that spirit&#151;known as a spirit animal. A spirit animal is a creature chosen by a shaman to serve as a conduit, allowing her to more fully access the magic of her spirit on a daily basis. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal also grants her special powers. This ability uses the same rules as the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature and is treated as a familiar (see pages 78 and 82 of the Core Rulebook), except as noted below.</p>
			<p>A shaman uses her level as her effective wizard level when determining the abilities of her spirit animal. A shaman can select any familiar available to wizards to serve as her spirit animal, although her spirit animal is augmented by the power of her chosen spirit. Once selected, the spirit animal cannot be changed. Although a shaman&#146;s spirit animal uses the statistics of a specific animal, it is treated as an outsider with the native subtype for the purposes of spells and abilities that affect it.</p>
			<p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack with shaman levels for the purpose of determining any spirit animal abilities that depend on the shaman&#146;s level. If a shaman possesses such levels in other classes, her spirit animal always uses the shaman rules for spirit animals, not those used by familiars of other classes (such as witches, wizards, or sorcerers with the arcane bloodline). If the shaman has witch levels, her spirit animal also serves as the conduit to her patron and stores her witch spells. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal is treated as a familiar for the purposes of all spells, effects, and abilities that affect familiars.</p>
			<p>If a spirit animal is lost or dies, it can be replaced after 24 hours through a special ritual that consumes material components worth 500 gp per shaman level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. The new spirit animal must be of the same sort of creature as the previous one.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman&#146;s spirit animal gains specific abilities, depending upon the type of spirit selected by the shaman using her spirit class feature. These abilities affect the animal&#146;s appearance and grant it special abilities that can aid it in serving the shaman and the spirit it represents and is connected to. These abilities are described in the spirit animal section of each individual spirit description.</p>
			<p><b>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </b>If a shaman is 3rd level or higher, her spirit animal can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the shaman and the spirit animal are in contact at the time the shaman casts a touch spell, she can designate her animal as the &#147;toucher.&#148; The spirit animal can then deliver the touch spell just as the shaman would. If the shaman casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the shaman activates a hex, her spirit animal can be used to make the touch; she doesn&#146;t have to be in contact with the animal to use this ability with hexes.</p>

					<p>A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells.

					<p>Using a hex is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Although some catfolk venerate elven and human deities, the traditional worship of the so-called &#147;spirits of creation&#148; is by far the most prevalent religion among their kind, especially in the catfolk nation of Murraseth. The serendipitous, shamanistic rites associated with this faith focus upon attracting good fortune and banishing ill fortune in the name of these spirits. Although the ancient practices of the serendipity shaman were once exclusive to the mysterious catfolk nation, the catfolk&#146;s curiosity and willingness to travel have spread them across Golarion, where today many with a tendency toward good fortune embrace the faith.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>While some heroes speak to gods or consort with otherworldly muses, shamans commune with the spirits of the world and the energies that exist in every living thing. These divine adventurers draw upon their power to shape the world and expand the inf luence of their spiritual patrons. Shamans have strong ties to natural spirits. They form powerful bonds with particular spirits, and as their power grows they learn to call upon other spirits in times of need.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Shamans make for potent divine spellcasters, capable of using divine spells and the power of their spirits to aid their allies and destroy their foes. While they aren&#146;t the healers that clerics are, they can still fill that role when needed.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p>P <b>arent Class(es): </b>Oracle and witch.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shaman's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), and Survival (Wis).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>A shaman is proficient with all simple weapons, and with light and medium armor.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the shaman spell list. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;9. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1&#150;3 in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>
			<p><b>Limited Calling: </b>A shaman must have a racial trait with &#147;luck&#148; in its name to select this archetype, such as cat&#146;s luck or half ling luck. A character with the Defiant LuckARG feat also qualifies for this archetype.</p>
			<p><b>Luck Magic: </b>A serendipity shaman adds the domain spells from the Luck cleric domain to the list of spells she can cast with the spirit magic ability instead of her spirit&#146;s spirit magic spells.</p>
			<p>This ability alters spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Shamans can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;9. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit (Su): </b>A shaman forms a mystical bond with the spirits of the world. She forms a lasting bond with a single spirit (see Spirits on page 37), which grants a number of abilities and defines many of her other class features.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a shaman gains the spirit ability granted by her chosen spirit. She adds the spells granted by that spirit to the list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She also adds the hexes possessed by that spirit to the list of hexes that she can use with the hex and wandering hex class features.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her selected spirit. At 16th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed for the true version of her selected spirit.</p>
			<p>If the shaman takes levels in another class that grants a mystery (such as the oracle), the spirit and mystery must match, even if that means one of them must change. Subject to GM discretion, the shaman can change her former mystery or spirit to make them conform.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman forms a close bond with a spirit animal tied to her chosen spirit. This animal is her conduit to the spirit world, guiding her along the path to enlightenment. The animal also aids a shaman by granting her a special ability. See the Spirit Animal section on page 47.</p>
			<p>A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells. While the spirit animal does not store the spells like a witch&#146;s familiar does, the spirit animal serves as her conduit to divine power. If a shaman&#146;s spirit animal is slain, she cannot prepare new spells or use her spirit magic class feature until the spirit animal is replaced.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Magic: </b>A shaman can spontaneously cast a limited number of spells per day beyond those she prepared ahead of time. She has one spell slot per day of each shaman spell level she can cast, not including orisons. She can choose these spells from the list of spells granted by her spirits (see the spirit class feature and the wandering spirit class feature) at the time she casts them. She can enhance these spells using any metamagic feat that she knows, using up a higher-level spell slot as required by the feat and increasing the time to cast the spell (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a shaman learns one hex. At 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.</p>
			<p>Using a hex is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Luck Hexes: </b>A serendipity shaman can select from any of the following hexes, in addition to general shaman hexes and the hexes granted by her spirit. When she gains the wandering spirit class feature, she can select one of these hexes in place of a wandering hex.</p>
			<p><i>Channel Luck (Su): </i>A serendipity shaman gains the ability to channel luck, as the cleric variant channeling ability of the same name (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 30), using her shaman level to determine her effective cleric level for the purpose of her channel energy ability. She does not count as having the channel energy ability for the purpose of meeting feat prerequisites or prestige class requirements with the exception of Selective Channeling, which the shaman can take as normal. A shaman must be at least 8th level before selecting this hex.</p>
			<p><i>Fortune (Ex): </i>This hex functions as the dual-cursed oracle revelation of the same name (Ultimate Magic 58), using the shaman&#146;s class level as her effective oracle level.</p>
			<p><i>Misfortune (Ex): </i>As a standard action, a serendipity shaman can afflict one target within 30 feet with misfortune, causing it to take a &#150;2 penalty on all saving throws against the shaman&#146;s spells. The effect lasts for 1 minute or until the target hits the shaman with an attack.</p>
			<p><i>Spirit Magic: </i>A serendipity shaman adds both her spirit&#146;s spirit magic spells and the domain spells from the Luck cleric domain to the list of spells she can cast with the spirit magic ability. This hex cannot be taken as a wandering hex.</p>
			<p><i>Tweak the Odds (Su): </i>Whenever the serendipity shaman or one of her allies within 30 feet rolls an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, the shaman can use this ability as an immediate action to tweak the odds in her favor, increasing the result of the die roll or check by 1. This can turn a normal hit into a critical threat, but it cannot make an attack roll an automatic hit (this bonus does not stack with effects that increase a weapon&#146;s critical threat range, such as Improved Critical or keen edge). The shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her shaman level. At 4th level and every 4 shaman levels thereafter, she can spend an additional use of this ability to further increase the die result of the target&#146;s roll by an additional 1. For example, a 12th-level shaman can spend up to three uses of this ability to increase an ally&#146;s roll by 1 per use expended.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Spirit (Su): </b>At 4th level, a shaman can form a temporary bond with a spirit other than the one selected using her spirit class feature. She must make this selection each day when preparing her spells. While this feature is active, she gains the spirit ability granted by the spirit. She also adds the spells granted by that spirit to her list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She does not add the hexes from her wandering spirit to her list of hexes that she can choose from with the hex class feature. At 12th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit. At 20th level, she gains the ability listed in the true version of her wandering spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Hex: </b>At 6th level, a shaman can temporarily gain the use of one of the hexes possessed by either one of her spirits. She must make this selection each day when she prepares her spells. For the purposes of this ability, she can select any hex possessed by her spirit or wandering spirit. If she selects it from her wandering spirit, she loses the hex immediately if she bonds with another spirit, although she can then select a different hex to gain using this ability, from either her spirit or her new wandering spirit. At 14th level, a shaman can select two wandering hexes each day instead of one. This ability otherwise functions as the hex class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Manifestation (Su): </b>Upon reaching 20th level, a shaman undergoes a transformation as she manifests as a pinnacle of her main spirit. The nature of this manifestation depends on the shaman&#146;s spirit, and is described in its entry.</p>
			<h>Spirit Animal</h>
			<p>By communing with the incredible powers of her spirit, the shaman forges a cherished bond with one specif ic servant of that spirit&#151;known as a spirit animal. A spirit animal is a creature chosen by a shaman to serve as a conduit, allowing her to more fully access the magic of her spirit on a daily basis. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal also grants her special powers. This ability uses the same rules as the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature and is treated as a familiar (see pages 78 and 82 of the Core Rulebook), except as noted below.</p>
			<p>A shaman uses her level as her effective wizard level when determining the abilities of her spirit animal. A shaman can select any familiar available to wizards to serve as her spirit animal, although her spirit animal is augmented by the power of her chosen spirit. Once selected, the spirit animal cannot be changed. Although a shaman&#146;s spirit animal uses the statistics of a specific animal, it is treated as an outsider with the native subtype for the purposes of spells and abilities that affect it.</p>
			<p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack with shaman levels for the purpose of determining any spirit animal abilities that depend on the shaman&#146;s level. If a shaman possesses such levels in other classes, her spirit animal always uses the shaman rules for spirit animals, not those used by familiars of other classes (such as witches, wizards, or sorcerers with the arcane bloodline). If the shaman has witch levels, her spirit animal also serves as the conduit to her patron and stores her witch spells. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal is treated as a familiar for the purposes of all spells, effects, and abilities that affect familiars.</p>
			<p>If a spirit animal is lost or dies, it can be replaced after 24 hours through a special ritual that consumes material components worth 500 gp per shaman level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. The new spirit animal must be of the same sort of creature as the previous one.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman&#146;s spirit animal gains specific abilities, depending upon the type of spirit selected by the shaman using her spirit class feature. These abilities affect the animal&#146;s appearance and grant it special abilities that can aid it in serving the shaman and the spirit it represents and is connected to. These abilities are described in the spirit animal section of each individual spirit description.</p>
			<p><b>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </b>If a shaman is 3rd level or higher, her spirit animal can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the shaman and the spirit animal are in contact at the time the shaman casts a touch spell, she can designate her animal as the &#147;toucher.&#148; The spirit animal can then deliver the touch spell just as the shaman would. If the shaman casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the shaman activates a hex, her spirit animal can be used to make the touch; she doesn&#146;t have to be in contact with the animal to use this ability with hexes.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The influence of primal magic extends beyond what is visible and material. Spirits that linger in areas where primal magic reigns can become warped, losing touch with their former selves and experiencing random surges of power. A shaman who communes with such spirits learns to stabilize these erratic energies and draw upon them to her benefit. Such shamans gradually learn to guide their spirits toward coherence and lucidity, and in the process learn to bend chance and fortune in their favor.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>While some heroes speak to gods or consort with otherworldly muses, shamans commune with the spirits of the world and the energies that exist in every living thing. These divine adventurers draw upon their power to shape the world and expand the inf luence of their spiritual patrons. Shamans have strong ties to natural spirits. They form powerful bonds with particular spirits, and as their power grows they learn to call upon other spirits in times of need.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Shamans make for potent divine spellcasters, capable of using divine spells and the power of their spirits to aid their allies and destroy their foes. While they aren&#146;t the healers that clerics are, they can still fill that role when needed.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p>P <b>arent Class(es): </b>Oracle and witch.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shaman's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), and Survival (Wis).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>A shaman is proficient with all simple weapons, and with light and medium armor.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the shaman spell list. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;9. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1&#150;3 in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Shamans can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;9. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit (Su): </b>A shaman forms a mystical bond with the spirits of the world. She forms a lasting bond with a single spirit (see Spirits on page 37), which grants a number of abilities and defines many of her other class features.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a shaman gains the spirit ability granted by her chosen spirit. She adds the spells granted by that spirit to the list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She also adds the hexes possessed by that spirit to the list of hexes that she can use with the hex and wandering hex class features.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her selected spirit. At 16th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed for the true version of her selected spirit.</p>
			<p>If the shaman takes levels in another class that grants a mystery (such as the oracle), the spirit and mystery must match, even if that means one of them must change. Subject to GM discretion, the shaman can change her former mystery or spirit to make them conform.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>A primal warden&#146;s spirit animal exhibits unusual physical features for a creature of its type, such as unnatural colorations and extra or missing appendages. Each day, the spirit animal gains resistance 10 against a random element. Roll 1d4 to determine the type of resistance (1 = acid, 2 = cold, 3 = electricity, 4 = fire).</p>
			<p>This replaces the abilities the shaman&#146;s spirit animal gains from the shaman&#146;s chosen spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Magic: </b>A shaman can spontaneously cast a limited number of spells per day beyond those she prepared ahead of time. She has one spell slot per day of each shaman spell level she can cast, not including orisons. She can choose these spells from the list of spells granted by her spirits (see the spirit class feature and the wandering spirit class feature) at the time she casts them. She can enhance these spells using any metamagic feat that she knows, using up a higher-level spell slot as required by the feat and increasing the time to cast the spell (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a shaman learns one hex. At 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.</p>
			<p>Using a hex is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>A primal warden shaman gains the hexes below at the specified levels.</p>
			<p>A primal warden shaman cannot select the chant hex, the evil eye hex, the misfortune hex, or any witch hexes. This alters hexes and replaces the hexes gained at 4th and 12th levels.</p>
			<p><i>Primal Blessing (Su): </i>At 4th level, the shaman gains the ability to channel primal magic into a target within 30 feet. Roll 1d4 to determine the effect. On a result of 1, the target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks. On a result of 2, the target&#146;s size is enlarged or reduced, as per enlarge person or reduce person, and the effect functions even if the target is not a humanoid; roll randomly to determine the effect. On a result of 3, the target gains a +20-foot enhancement bonus to her base speed. On a result of 4, all attacks against the target suffer a 20% miss chance. The effects of this hex last for 1 minute. A creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.</p>
			<p><i>Greater Primal Blessing (Su): </i>At 12th level, the shaman&#146;s primal blessing hex improves. This functions as the primal blessing hex in all ways, except that the shaman has a chance to bestow greater benefits upon her targets. Roll 1d6 to determine the effect. On a result of 1&#150;4, refer to the primal blessing ability to determine the effect. On a roll of 5, the target gains a +2 luck bonus on attack rolls and saving throws and to her Armor Class. On a roll of 6, the target gains the benefit of the haste spell, using the primal warden&#146;s shaman level as her caster level.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Spirit (Su): </b>At 4th level, a shaman can form a temporary bond with a spirit other than the one selected using her spirit class feature. She must make this selection each day when preparing her spells. While this feature is active, she gains the spirit ability granted by the spirit. She also adds the spells granted by that spirit to her list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She does not add the hexes from her wandering spirit to her list of hexes that she can choose from with the hex class feature. At 12th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit. At 20th level, she gains the ability listed in the true version of her wandering spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Hex: </b>At 6th level, a shaman can temporarily gain the use of one of the hexes possessed by either one of her spirits. She must make this selection each day when she prepares her spells. For the purposes of this ability, she can select any hex possessed by her spirit or wandering spirit. If she selects it from her wandering spirit, she loses the hex immediately if she bonds with another spirit, although she can then select a different hex to gain using this ability, from either her spirit or her new wandering spirit. At 14th level, a shaman can select two wandering hexes each day instead of one. This ability otherwise functions as the hex class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Manifestation (Su): </b>Upon reaching 20th level, a shaman undergoes a transformation as she manifests as a pinnacle of her main spirit. The nature of this manifestation depends on the shaman&#146;s spirit, and is described in its entry.</p>
			<h>Spirit Animal</h>
			<p>By communing with the incredible powers of her spirit, the shaman forges a cherished bond with one specif ic servant of that spirit&#151;known as a spirit animal. A spirit animal is a creature chosen by a shaman to serve as a conduit, allowing her to more fully access the magic of her spirit on a daily basis. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal also grants her special powers. This ability uses the same rules as the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature and is treated as a familiar (see pages 78 and 82 of the Core Rulebook), except as noted below.</p>
			<p>A shaman uses her level as her effective wizard level when determining the abilities of her spirit animal. A shaman can select any familiar available to wizards to serve as her spirit animal, although her spirit animal is augmented by the power of her chosen spirit. Once selected, the spirit animal cannot be changed. Although a shaman&#146;s spirit animal uses the statistics of a specific animal, it is treated as an outsider with the native subtype for the purposes of spells and abilities that affect it.</p>
			<p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack with shaman levels for the purpose of determining any spirit animal abilities that depend on the shaman&#146;s level. If a shaman possesses such levels in other classes, her spirit animal always uses the shaman rules for spirit animals, not those used by familiars of other classes (such as witches, wizards, or sorcerers with the arcane bloodline). If the shaman has witch levels, her spirit animal also serves as the conduit to her patron and stores her witch spells. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal is treated as a familiar for the purposes of all spells, effects, and abilities that affect familiars.</p>
			<p>If a spirit animal is lost or dies, it can be replaced after 24 hours through a special ritual that consumes material components worth 500 gp per shaman level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. The new spirit animal must be of the same sort of creature as the previous one.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman&#146;s spirit animal gains specific abilities, depending upon the type of spirit selected by the shaman using her spirit class feature. These abilities affect the animal&#146;s appearance and grant it special abilities that can aid it in serving the shaman and the spirit it represents and is connected to. These abilities are described in the spirit animal section of each individual spirit description.</p>
			<p><b>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </b>If a shaman is 3rd level or higher, her spirit animal can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the shaman and the spirit animal are in contact at the time the shaman casts a touch spell, she can designate her animal as the &#147;toucher.&#148; The spirit animal can then deliver the touch spell just as the shaman would. If the shaman casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the shaman activates a hex, her spirit animal can be used to make the touch; she doesn&#146;t have to be in contact with the animal to use this ability with hexes.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>For a possessed shaman, merely communing with the spirit world is insufficient. Instead, she invites the spirits to share her body, granting them the chance to experience corporeal existence. In return, they grant her their skills and protect her from otherworldly influence.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>While some heroes speak to gods or consort with otherworldly muses, shamans commune with the spirits of the world and the energies that exist in every living thing. These divine adventurers draw upon their power to shape the world and expand the inf luence of their spiritual patrons. Shamans have strong ties to natural spirits. They form powerful bonds with particular spirits, and as their power grows they learn to call upon other spirits in times of need.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Shamans make for potent divine spellcasters, capable of using divine spells and the power of their spirits to aid their allies and destroy their foes. While they aren&#146;t the healers that clerics are, they can still fill that role when needed.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p>P <b>arent Class(es): </b>Oracle and witch.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shaman's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), and Survival (Wis).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>A shaman is proficient with all simple weapons, and with light and medium armor.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the shaman spell list. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;9. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1&#150;3 in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Shamans can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;9. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit (Su): </b>A shaman forms a mystical bond with the spirits of the world. She forms a lasting bond with a single spirit (see Spirits on page 37), which grants a number of abilities and defines many of her other class features.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a shaman gains the spirit ability granted by her chosen spirit. She adds the spells granted by that spirit to the list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She also adds the hexes possessed by that spirit to the list of hexes that she can use with the hex and wandering hex class features.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her selected spirit. At 16th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed for the true version of her selected spirit.</p>
			<p>If the shaman takes levels in another class that grants a mystery (such as the oracle), the spirit and mystery must match, even if that means one of them must change. Subject to GM discretion, the shaman can change her former mystery or spirit to make them conform.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman forms a close bond with a spirit animal tied to her chosen spirit. This animal is her conduit to the spirit world, guiding her along the path to enlightenment. The animal also aids a shaman by granting her a special ability. See the Spirit Animal section on page 47.</p>
			<p>A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells. While the spirit animal does not store the spells like a witch&#146;s familiar does, the spirit animal serves as her conduit to divine power. If a shaman&#146;s spirit animal is slain, she cannot prepare new spells or use her spirit magic class feature until the spirit animal is replaced.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Magic: </b>A shaman can spontaneously cast a limited number of spells per day beyond those she prepared ahead of time. She has one spell slot per day of each shaman spell level she can cast, not including orisons. She can choose these spells from the list of spells granted by her spirits (see the spirit class feature and the wandering spirit class feature) at the time she casts them. She can enhance these spells using any metamagic feat that she knows, using up a higher-level spell slot as required by the feat and increasing the time to cast the spell (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a shaman learns one hex. At 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.</p>
			<p>Using a hex is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Spirit (Su): </b>At 4th level, a shaman can form a temporary bond with a spirit other than the one selected using her spirit class feature. She must make this selection each day when preparing her spells. While this feature is active, she gains the spirit ability granted by the spirit. She also adds the spells granted by that spirit to her list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She does not add the hexes from her wandering spirit to her list of hexes that she can choose from with the hex class feature. At 12th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit. At 20th level, she gains the ability listed in the true version of her wandering spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Skills (Su): </b>At 6th level, a possessed shaman is able to make room for another spirit. When choosing her wandering spirit for the day, the possessed shaman chooses one skill. The possessed shaman treats this skill as if she had a number of ranks in it equal to her shaman level, and uses her Wisdom modifier in place of the ability modifier the skill would normally use. If the skill is a class skill, she receives the usual +3 bonus on skill checks for having ranks in that skill. Each time the possessed shaman changes her wandering spirit, she can also change the skill gained through this ability. These ranks do not stack with her other skill ranks (only the higher number of ranks applies). This ability replaces the wandering hex gained at 6th level.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Hex: </b>At 14th level, a shaman can temporarily gain the use of one of the hexes possessed by either one of her spirits. She must make this selection each day when she prepares her spells. For the purposes of this ability, she can select any hex possessed by her spirit or wandering spirit. If she selects it from her wandering spirit, she loses the hex immediately if she bonds with another spirit, although she can then select a different hex to gain using this ability, from either her spirit or her new wandering spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Manifestation (Su): </b>Upon reaching 20th level, a shaman undergoes a transformation as she manifests as a pinnacle of her main spirit. The nature of this manifestation depends on the shaman&#146;s spirit, and is described in its entry.</p>
			<h>Spirit Animal</h>
			<p>By communing with the incredible powers of her spirit, the shaman forges a cherished bond with one specif ic servant of that spirit&#151;known as a spirit animal. A spirit animal is a creature chosen by a shaman to serve as a conduit, allowing her to more fully access the magic of her spirit on a daily basis. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal also grants her special powers. This ability uses the same rules as the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature and is treated as a familiar (see pages 78 and 82 of the Core Rulebook), except as noted below.</p>
			<p>A shaman uses her level as her effective wizard level when determining the abilities of her spirit animal. A shaman can select any familiar available to wizards to serve as her spirit animal, although her spirit animal is augmented by the power of her chosen spirit. Once selected, the spirit animal cannot be changed. Although a shaman&#146;s spirit animal uses the statistics of a specific animal, it is treated as an outsider with the native subtype for the purposes of spells and abilities that affect it.</p>
			<p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack with shaman levels for the purpose of determining any spirit animal abilities that depend on the shaman&#146;s level. If a shaman possesses such levels in other classes, her spirit animal always uses the shaman rules for spirit animals, not those used by familiars of other classes (such as witches, wizards, or sorcerers with the arcane bloodline). If the shaman has witch levels, her spirit animal also serves as the conduit to her patron and stores her witch spells. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal is treated as a familiar for the purposes of all spells, effects, and abilities that affect familiars.</p>
			<p>If a spirit animal is lost or dies, it can be replaced after 24 hours through a special ritual that consumes material components worth 500 gp per shaman level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. The new spirit animal must be of the same sort of creature as the previous one.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman&#146;s spirit animal gains specific abilities, depending upon the type of spirit selected by the shaman using her spirit class feature. These abilities affect the animal&#146;s appearance and grant it special abilities that can aid it in serving the shaman and the spirit it represents and is connected to. These abilities are described in the spirit animal section of each individual spirit description.</p>
			<p><b>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </b>If a shaman is 3rd level or higher, her spirit animal can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the shaman and the spirit animal are in contact at the time the shaman casts a touch spell, she can designate her animal as the &#147;toucher.&#148; The spirit animal can then deliver the touch spell just as the shaman would. If the shaman casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the shaman activates a hex, her spirit animal can be used to make the touch; she doesn&#146;t have to be in contact with the animal to use this ability with hexes.</p>

At 12th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit. At 20th level, she gains the ability listed in the true version of her wandering spirit.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>While all shamans use their connection to the spirits of the world to draw upon otherworldly magic powers, the shamans of the Lands of the Linnorm Kings have a unique tradition in which they use the power of patron spirits to directly control their enemies. Such overseers may assume roles as religious leaders and protectors of their tribes, turning foes into short-term allies for the tribe&#146;s greater good. Other overseers become tyrants who enforce their will upon the weak for personal gain. In combat, an overseer manages the battlefield by debilitating foes using her hexes and specialized spells.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>While some heroes speak to gods or consort with otherworldly muses, shamans commune with the spirits of the world and the energies that exist in every living thing. These divine adventurers draw upon their power to shape the world and expand the inf luence of their spiritual patrons. Shamans have strong ties to natural spirits. They form powerful bonds with particular spirits, and as their power grows they learn to call upon other spirits in times of need.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Shamans make for potent divine spellcasters, capable of using divine spells and the power of their spirits to aid their allies and destroy their foes. While they aren&#146;t the healers that clerics are, they can still fill that role when needed.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p>P <b>arent Class(es): </b>Oracle and witch.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shaman's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), and Survival (Wis).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>A shaman is proficient with all simple weapons, and with light and medium armor.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the shaman spell list. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;9. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1&#150;3 in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>
			<p><b>Controlling Magic (Su): </b>The overseer adds the following spells to the list of spells she can cast using spirit magic: charm person (1st), hideous laughter (2nd), hold person (3rd), crushing despair (4th), feeblemind (5th), mass suggestion (6th), power word blind (7th), irresistible dance (8th), and dominate monster (9th).</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the spirit magic spells gained from the shaman&#146;s spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Shamans can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;9. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit (Su): </b>A shaman forms a mystical bond with the spirits of the world. She forms a lasting bond with a single spirit (see Spirits on page 37), which grants a number of abilities and defines many of her other class features.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a shaman gains the spirit ability granted by her chosen spirit. She adds the spells granted by that spirit to the list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She also adds the hexes possessed by that spirit to the list of hexes that she can use with the hex and wandering hex class features.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her selected spirit. At 16th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed for the true version of her selected spirit.</p>
			<p>If the shaman takes levels in another class that grants a mystery (such as the oracle), the spirit and mystery must match, even if that means one of them must change. Subject to GM discretion, the shaman can change her former mystery or spirit to make them conform.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman forms a close bond with a spirit animal tied to her chosen spirit. This animal is her conduit to the spirit world, guiding her along the path to enlightenment. The animal also aids a shaman by granting her a special ability. See the Spirit Animal section on page 47.</p>
			<p>A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells. While the spirit animal does not store the spells like a witch&#146;s familiar does, the spirit animal serves as her conduit to divine power. If a shaman&#146;s spirit animal is slain, she cannot prepare new spells or use her spirit magic class feature until the spirit animal is replaced.</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a shaman learns one hex. At 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.</p>
			<p>Using a hex is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Surge (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, an overseer gains the ability to cast any of her mind-affecting spells that target a single creature through her spirit animal. When she&#146;s using this ability, the selected spell&#146;s range becomes touch, and she must deliver the spell through the spirit animal via the spirit animal&#146;s deliver touch spells supernatural ability. The shaman&#146;s effective caster level for these spells is 2 higher than her normal caster level. The overseer can deliver any other spells via the deliver touch spells spirit animal ability.</p>
			<p>This alters the deliver touch spells spirit animal ability.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Spirit (Su): </b>At 4th level, a shaman can form a temporary bond with a spirit other than the one selected using her spirit class feature. She must make this selection each day when preparing her spells. While this feature is active, she gains the spirit ability granted by the spirit. She also adds the spells granted by that spirit to her list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She does not add the hexes from her wandering spirit to her list of hexes that she can choose from with the hex class feature. At 12th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit. At 20th level, she gains the ability listed in the true version of her wandering spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Hex: </b>At 6th level, a shaman can temporarily gain the use of one of the hexes possessed by either one of her spirits. She must make this selection each day when she prepares her spells. For the purposes of this ability, she can select any hex possessed by her spirit or wandering spirit. If she selects it from her wandering spirit, she loses the hex immediately if she bonds with another spirit, although she can then select a different hex to gain using this ability, from either her spirit or her new wandering spirit. At 14th level, a shaman can select two wandering hexes each day instead of one. This ability otherwise functions as the hex class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Manifestation (Su): </b>Upon reaching 20th level, a shaman undergoes a transformation as she manifests as a pinnacle of her main spirit. The nature of this manifestation depends on the shaman&#146;s spirit, and is described in its entry.</p>
			<h>Spirit Animal</h>
			<p>By communing with the incredible powers of her spirit, the shaman forges a cherished bond with one specif ic servant of that spirit&#151;known as a spirit animal. A spirit animal is a creature chosen by a shaman to serve as a conduit, allowing her to more fully access the magic of her spirit on a daily basis. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal also grants her special powers. This ability uses the same rules as the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature and is treated as a familiar (see pages 78 and 82 of the Core Rulebook), except as noted below.</p>
			<p>A shaman uses her level as her effective wizard level when determining the abilities of her spirit animal. A shaman can select any familiar available to wizards to serve as her spirit animal, although her spirit animal is augmented by the power of her chosen spirit. Once selected, the spirit animal cannot be changed. Although a shaman&#146;s spirit animal uses the statistics of a specific animal, it is treated as an outsider with the native subtype for the purposes of spells and abilities that affect it.</p>
			<p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack with shaman levels for the purpose of determining any spirit animal abilities that depend on the shaman&#146;s level. If a shaman possesses such levels in other classes, her spirit animal always uses the shaman rules for spirit animals, not those used by familiars of other classes (such as witches, wizards, or sorcerers with the arcane bloodline). If the shaman has witch levels, her spirit animal also serves as the conduit to her patron and stores her witch spells. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal is treated as a familiar for the purposes of all spells, effects, and abilities that affect familiars.</p>
			<p>If a spirit animal is lost or dies, it can be replaced after 24 hours through a special ritual that consumes material components worth 500 gp per shaman level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. The new spirit animal must be of the same sort of creature as the previous one.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman&#146;s spirit animal gains specific abilities, depending upon the type of spirit selected by the shaman using her spirit class feature. These abilities affect the animal&#146;s appearance and grant it special abilities that can aid it in serving the shaman and the spirit it represents and is connected to. These abilities are described in the spirit animal section of each individual spirit description.</p>
			<p><b>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </b>If a shaman is 3rd level or higher, her spirit animal can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the shaman and the spirit animal are in contact at the time the shaman casts a touch spell, she can designate her animal as the &#147;toucher.&#148; The spirit animal can then deliver the touch spell just as the shaman would. If the shaman casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the shaman activates a hex, her spirit animal can be used to make the touch; she doesn&#146;t have to be in contact with the animal to use this ability with hexes.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Pathfinders who perish in the pursuit of greater knowledge are commemorated on the Wall of Names, a curving monument of black glass at the Grand Lodge. Originally started as a humble memorial, the Wall of Names is now a moving testament to all those who have given their lives to further the cause of the Pathfinder Society, and for many agents, an expedition to Absalom is as much a chance to visit the Wall of Names and seek out a vanished loved one, relation, or departed friend as it is an opportunity to visit the place where it all began.</i></p>
			<p><i>A decade ago, a small cadre of agents began studying the fallen names, correlating these adventurers with the quests they were on when they perished or went missing, and then took it upon themselves to finish these incomplete missions&#151; but in so doing these agents made an unexpected discovery. In delving into the storied histories etched into the Wall of Names, these agents have discovered how to commune with the departed spirits of those whose names are memorialized on the monument. These mystical agents soon became known as name-keepers, and they pride themselves on helping their predecessors find peace while preventing other Pathfinders&#146; names from being added to the wall.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>While some heroes speak to gods or consort with otherworldly muses, shamans commune with the spirits of the world and the energies that exist in every living thing. These divine adventurers draw upon their power to shape the world and expand the inf luence of their spiritual patrons. Shamans have strong ties to natural spirits. They form powerful bonds with particular spirits, and as their power grows they learn to call upon other spirits in times of need.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Shamans make for potent divine spellcasters, capable of using divine spells and the power of their spirits to aid their allies and destroy their foes. While they aren&#146;t the healers that clerics are, they can still fill that role when needed.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p>P <b>arent Class(es): </b>Oracle and witch.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shaman's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), and Spellcraft (Int).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>A shaman is proficient with all simple weapons, and with light and medium armor.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the shaman spell list. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;9. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1&#150;3 in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>
			<p><b>Inherited Wayfinder (Su): </b>A name-keeper forms a powerful bond with a damaged wayfinder (see pages 148&#150;149) inherited from another Pathfinder. It functions for her alone. This functions as a wizard&#146;s bonded object except it can be used to cast shaman spells (instead of wizard spells).</p>
			<p>This ability replaces spirit animal.</p>
			<p><b>Keeper Spirit Magic: </b>The namekeeper adds the following spells to the list of spells she can cast using spirit magic: stone shieldARG (1st), object readingOA (2nd), speak with dead (3rd), wall of stone (4th), breath of life (5th), stone tell (6th), vision (7th), word of recall (8th), and true resurrection (9th).</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the spirit magic spells gained from the shaman&#146;s spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Shamans can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;9. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit (Su): </b>A shaman forms a mystical bond with the spirits of the world. She forms a lasting bond with a single spirit (see Spirits on page 37), which grants a number of abilities and defines many of her other class features.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a shaman gains the spirit ability granted by her chosen spirit. She adds the spells granted by that spirit to the list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She also adds the hexes possessed by that spirit to the list of hexes that she can use with the hex and wandering hex class features.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her selected spirit. At 16th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed for the true version of her selected spirit.</p>
			<p>If the shaman takes levels in another class that grants a mystery (such as the oracle), the spirit and mystery must match, even if that means one of them must change. Subject to GM discretion, the shaman can change her former mystery or spirit to make them conform.</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a shaman learns one hex. At 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.</p>
			<p>Using a hex is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Pathfinders Past (Su): </b>At 4th level, a name-keeper can form a temporary bond with a deceased Pathfinder who is commemorated on the Wall of Names. The namekeeper must make this selection each day when preparing her spells. While this feature is active, she gains one or more benefits tied to the Pathfinder&#146;s former focus in the Society: Scrolls, Spells, or Swords. Each allows her to select one or more options (such as a weapon or shaman spirit), and she can choose different options each time she forms this bond.</p>
			<p><i>Scrolls: </i>The name-keeper selects an oracleAPG mystery. She can use any of the mystery&#146;s associated skills untrained, and she treats them as class skills. For any of those skills that were already class skills, she instead gains a +2 sacred bonus on those checks. At 12th level, she gains Skill Focus for one of the associated skills as a bonus feat. At 20th level, she gains Skill Focus a second time as a bonus feat, and she always counts as having at least 10 ranks in those skills for calculating these temporary feats&#146; benefits.</p>
			<p><i>Spells: </i>The name-keeper selects a second shaman spirit and adds the spells granted by that spirit to her list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She gains one additional spirit magic spell slot of her highest spell level. At 12th level, she selects two shaman spirits and adds both their granted spells to the list of spells she can cast using spirit magic. At 20th level, her number of spirit magic spell slots at each spell level increases to two.</p>
			<p><i>Swords: </i>The name-keeper gains proficiency in all martial weapons and one exotic weapon of her choice. At 12th level, whenever she makes a full attack, she gains one additional attack at her highest base attack bonus; this ability stacks with the extra attack from haste, but it doesn&#146;t stack with other abilities that grant extra attacks. At 20th level, she gains two combat feats for which she qualifies.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces wandering spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Versatile Hex (Su): </b>At 6th level, a namekeeper can temporarily gain a shaman hex or one of the hexes that her spirit has when she prepares her spells, lasting until the next time she prepares spells. At 14th level, she can select two such hexes each day.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces wandering hex.</p>
			<p><b>Manifestation (Su): </b>Upon reaching 20th level, a shaman undergoes a transformation as she manifests as a pinnacle of her main spirit. The nature of this manifestation depends on the shaman&#146;s spirit, and is described in its entry.</p>
			<h>Spirit Animal</h>
			<p>By communing with the incredible powers of her spirit, the shaman forges a cherished bond with one specif ic servant of that spirit&#151;known as a spirit animal. A spirit animal is a creature chosen by a shaman to serve as a conduit, allowing her to more fully access the magic of her spirit on a daily basis. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal also grants her special powers. This ability uses the same rules as the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature and is treated as a familiar (see pages 78 and 82 of the Core Rulebook), except as noted below.</p>
			<p>A shaman uses her level as her effective wizard level when determining the abilities of her spirit animal. A shaman can select any familiar available to wizards to serve as her spirit animal, although her spirit animal is augmented by the power of her chosen spirit. Once selected, the spirit animal cannot be changed. Although a shaman&#146;s spirit animal uses the statistics of a specific animal, it is treated as an outsider with the native subtype for the purposes of spells and abilities that affect it.</p>
			<p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack with shaman levels for the purpose of determining any spirit animal abilities that depend on the shaman&#146;s level. If a shaman possesses such levels in other classes, her spirit animal always uses the shaman rules for spirit animals, not those used by familiars of other classes (such as witches, wizards, or sorcerers with the arcane bloodline). If the shaman has witch levels, her spirit animal also serves as the conduit to her patron and stores her witch spells. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal is treated as a familiar for the purposes of all spells, effects, and abilities that affect familiars.</p>
			<p>If a spirit animal is lost or dies, it can be replaced after 24 hours through a special ritual that consumes material components worth 500 gp per shaman level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. The new spirit animal must be of the same sort of creature as the previous one.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman&#146;s spirit animal gains specific abilities, depending upon the type of spirit selected by the shaman using her spirit class feature. These abilities affect the animal&#146;s appearance and grant it special abilities that can aid it in serving the shaman and the spirit it represents and is connected to. These abilities are described in the spirit animal section of each individual spirit description.</p>
			<p><b>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </b>If a shaman is 3rd level or higher, her spirit animal can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the shaman and the spirit animal are in contact at the time the shaman casts a touch spell, she can designate her animal as the &#147;toucher.&#148; The spirit animal can then deliver the touch spell just as the shaman would. If the shaman casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the shaman activates a hex, her spirit animal can be used to make the touch; she doesn&#146;t have to be in contact with the animal to use this ability with hexes.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Grasping vine shamans are typically adherents of one of several scattered sects dedicated to the Green Mother. They revere plant life in all its forms, with a special fondness for poisonous or carnivorous plants. Unlike most shamans, a grasping vine is guided by a plantlike creature rather than a spirit animal.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>While some heroes speak to gods or consort with otherworldly muses, shamans commune with the spirits of the world and the energies that exist in every living thing. These divine adventurers draw upon their power to shape the world and expand the inf luence of their spiritual patrons. Shamans have strong ties to natural spirits. They form powerful bonds with particular spirits, and as their power grows they learn to call upon other spirits in times of need.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Shamans make for potent divine spellcasters, capable of using divine spells and the power of their spirits to aid their allies and destroy their foes. While they aren&#146;t the healers that clerics are, they can still fill that role when needed.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p>P <b>arent Class(es): </b>Oracle and witch.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shaman's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), and Survival (Wis).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>A shaman is proficient with all simple weapons, and with light and medium armor.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the shaman spell list. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;9. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1&#150;3 in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Shamans can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;9. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Plant Spirit (Ex): </b>A shaman&#146;s spirit animal is made of leaves and thorny vines. This plant spirit has the statistics and abilities as a shaman&#146;s spirit animal, but it is treated as a creature of the plant type rather than a native outsider.</p>
			<p>This ability alters the shaman&#146;s spirit animal.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit (Su): </b>Though a grasping vine is not limited to a particular choice of spirit, common selections are Life, Nature, or Wood (Pathfinder Player Companion Heroes of the Wild 26).</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a shaman gains the spirit ability granted by her chosen spirit. She adds the spells granted by that spirit to the list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She also adds the hexes possessed by that spirit to the list of hexes that she can use with the hex and wandering hex class features.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her selected spirit. At 16th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed for the true version of her selected spirit.</p>
			<p>If the shaman takes levels in another class that grants a mystery (such as the oracle), the spirit and mystery must match, even if that means one of them must change. Subject to GM discretion, the shaman can change her former mystery or spirit to make them conform.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman forms a close bond with a spirit animal tied to her chosen spirit. This animal is her conduit to the spirit world, guiding her along the path to enlightenment. The animal also aids a shaman by granting her a special ability. See the Spirit Animal section on page 47.</p>
			<p>A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells. While the spirit animal does not store the spells like a witch&#146;s familiar does, the spirit animal serves as her conduit to divine power. If a shaman&#146;s spirit animal is slain, she cannot prepare new spells or use her spirit magic class feature until the spirit animal is replaced.</p>
			<p><b>Verdant Magic: </b>A grasping vine adds the following spells to the list of spells she can cast using spirit magic: entangle (1st), barkskin (2nd), thorny entanglementACG (3rd), command plants (4th), wall of thorns (5th), fire seeds (6th), animate plants (7th), horrid wilting (8th), and shambler (9th).</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the spirit magic spells granted by the shaman&#146;s spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Greentongue (Sp): </b>At 2nd level, as a standard action, a grasping vine can use speak with plants as a spell-like ability. The grasping vine can use this ability a number of times per day equal to half her shaman level. In addition, while under the effects of speak with plants, the grasping vine can deliver a suggestion (as per the spell) to a single plant creature within 30 feet, ignoring the plant&#146;s immunity to mind-affecting effects. The grasping vine can use this ability once per day at 2nd level, plus an additional time per day every 4 levels after 2nd level.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the shaman&#146;s hex gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 4th level, a shaman learns one hex. At 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.</p>
			<p>Using a hex is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Spirit (Su): </b>At 4th level, a shaman can form a temporary bond with a spirit other than the one selected using her spirit class feature. She must make this selection each day when preparing her spells. While this feature is active, she gains the spirit ability granted by the spirit. She also adds the spells granted by that spirit to her list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She does not add the hexes from her wandering spirit to her list of hexes that she can choose from with the hex class feature. At 12th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit. At 20th level, she gains the ability listed in the true version of her wandering spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Hex: </b>At 6th level, a shaman can temporarily gain the use of one of the hexes possessed by either one of her spirits. She must make this selection each day when she prepares her spells. For the purposes of this ability, she can select any hex possessed by her spirit or wandering spirit. If she selects it from her wandering spirit, she loses the hex immediately if she bonds with another spirit, although she can then select a different hex to gain using this ability, from either her spirit or her new wandering spirit. At 14th level, a shaman can select two wandering hexes each day instead of one. This ability otherwise functions as the hex class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Flower&#146;s Form (Sp): </b>At 8th level, as a standard action, a grasping vine can assume the form of a Small or Medium plant creature, as per plant shape I. At 12th level, this ability functions as plant shape II. At 16th level, this ability functions as plant shape III. The grasping vine can use this ability for 1 minute per shaman level per day. This duration does not need to be used consecutively, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the shaman&#146;s hex gained at 8th level.</p>
			<p><b>Manifestation (Su): </b>Upon reaching 20th level, a shaman undergoes a transformation as she manifests as a pinnacle of her main spirit. The nature of this manifestation depends on the shaman&#146;s spirit, and is described in its entry.</p>
			<h>Spirit Animal</h>
			<p>By communing with the incredible powers of her spirit, the shaman forges a cherished bond with one specif ic servant of that spirit&#151;known as a spirit animal. A spirit animal is a creature chosen by a shaman to serve as a conduit, allowing her to more fully access the magic of her spirit on a daily basis. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal also grants her special powers. This ability uses the same rules as the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature and is treated as a familiar (see pages 78 and 82 of the Core Rulebook), except as noted below.</p>
			<p>A shaman uses her level as her effective wizard level when determining the abilities of her spirit animal. A shaman can select any familiar available to wizards to serve as her spirit animal, although her spirit animal is augmented by the power of her chosen spirit. Once selected, the spirit animal cannot be changed. Although a shaman&#146;s spirit animal uses the statistics of a specific animal, it is treated as an outsider with the native subtype for the purposes of spells and abilities that affect it.</p>
			<p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack with shaman levels for the purpose of determining any spirit animal abilities that depend on the shaman&#146;s level. If a shaman possesses such levels in other classes, her spirit animal always uses the shaman rules for spirit animals, not those used by familiars of other classes (such as witches, wizards, or sorcerers with the arcane bloodline). If the shaman has witch levels, her spirit animal also serves as the conduit to her patron and stores her witch spells. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal is treated as a familiar for the purposes of all spells, effects, and abilities that affect familiars.</p>
			<p>If a spirit animal is lost or dies, it can be replaced after 24 hours through a special ritual that consumes material components worth 500 gp per shaman level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. The new spirit animal must be of the same sort of creature as the previous one.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman&#146;s spirit animal gains specific abilities, depending upon the type of spirit selected by the shaman using her spirit class feature. These abilities affect the animal&#146;s appearance and grant it special abilities that can aid it in serving the shaman and the spirit it represents and is connected to. These abilities are described in the spirit animal section of each individual spirit description.</p>
			<p><b>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </b>If a shaman is 3rd level or higher, her spirit animal can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the shaman and the spirit animal are in contact at the time the shaman casts a touch spell, she can designate her animal as the &#147;toucher.&#148; The spirit animal can then deliver the touch spell just as the shaman would. If the shaman casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the shaman activates a hex, her spirit animal can be used to make the touch; she doesn&#146;t have to be in contact with the animal to use this ability with hexes.</p>

					<p>A draconic shaman gains a drake companion instead of a spirit animal, and she communes with the drake to prepare her spells just as other shamans commune with their spirit animals. She doesn&#146;t gain a primary spirit, but she still gains wandering spirit at 4th level. She must select all her hexes (other than her wandering hexes) from the list of shaman hexes, and she can&#146;t select the witch hex shaman hex. She doesn&#146;t gain spirit magic slots until 4th level when she gains her wandering spirit. Any ability granted by a wandering spirit that would normally affect a spirit animal (such as nature&#146;s true spirit ability) has no effect for a draconic shaman.</p>

					<p>A shaman can spontaneously cast a limited number of spells per day beyond those she prepared ahead of time. She has one spell slot per day of each shaman spell level she can cast, not including orisons. She can choose these spells from the list of spells granted by her spirits (see the spirit class feature and the wandering spirit class feature) at the time she casts them. She can enhance these spells using any metamagic feat that she knows, using up a higher-level spell slot as required by the feat and increasing the time to cast the spell (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>In some regions of Tian Xia, shamans are unusually common, and may have strong ties to dragon gods and imperial dragons who act as mentors. Some of these shamans draw their powers from the might of dragons, rather than from spirits. These shamans each gain a powerful drake as an ally, and view caring for that drake as a sacred duty.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>While some heroes speak to gods or consort with otherworldly muses, shamans commune with the spirits of the world and the energies that exist in every living thing. These divine adventurers draw upon their power to shape the world and expand the inf luence of their spiritual patrons. Shamans have strong ties to natural spirits. They form powerful bonds with particular spirits, and as their power grows they learn to call upon other spirits in times of need.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Shamans make for potent divine spellcasters, capable of using divine spells and the power of their spirits to aid their allies and destroy their foes. While they aren&#146;t the healers that clerics are, they can still fill that role when needed.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p>P <b>arent Class(es): </b>Oracle and witch.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shaman's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), and Survival (Wis).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>A shaman is proficient with all simple weapons, and with light and medium armor.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the shaman spell list. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;9. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1&#150;3 in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Shamans can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;9. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Drake Companion: </b>A draconic shaman gains a drake companion instead of a spirit animal, and she communes with the drake to prepare her spells just as other shamans commune with their spirit animals. She doesn&#146;t gain a primary spirit, but she still gains wandering spirit at 4th level. She must select all her hexes (other than her wandering hexes) from the list of shaman hexes, and she can&#146;t select the witch hex shaman hex. She doesn&#146;t gain spirit magic slots until 4th level when she gains her wandering spirit. Any ability granted by a wandering spirit that would normally affect a spirit animal (such as nature&#146;s true spirit ability) has no effect for a draconic shaman.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces spirit, spirit animal, and the hexes gained at 4th and 10th levels and alters spirit magic.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Magic: </b>A shaman can spontaneously cast a limited number of spells per day beyond those she prepared ahead of time. She has one spell slot per day of each shaman spell level she can cast, not including orisons. She can choose these spells from the list of spells granted by her spirits (see the spirit class feature and the wandering spirit class feature) at the time she casts them. She can enhance these spells using any metamagic feat that she knows, using up a higher-level spell slot as required by the feat and increasing the time to cast the spell (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a shaman learns one hex. At 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.</p>
			<p>Using a hex is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Spirit (Su): </b>At 4th level, a shaman can form a temporary bond with a spirit other than the one selected using her spirit class feature. She must make this selection each day when preparing her spells. While this feature is active, she gains the spirit ability granted by the spirit. She also adds the spells granted by that spirit to her list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She does not add the hexes from her wandering spirit to her list of hexes that she can choose from with the hex class feature. At 12th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit. At 20th level, she gains the ability listed in the true version of her wandering spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Hex: </b>At 6th level, a shaman can temporarily gain the use of one of the hexes possessed by either one of her spirits. She must make this selection each day when she prepares her spells. For the purposes of this ability, she can select any hex possessed by her spirit or wandering spirit. If she selects it from her wandering spirit, she loses the hex immediately if she bonds with another spirit, although she can then select a different hex to gain using this ability, from either her spirit or her new wandering spirit. At 14th level, a shaman can select two wandering hexes each day instead of one. This ability otherwise functions as the hex class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Manifestation (Su): </b>Upon reaching 20th level, a shaman undergoes a transformation as she manifests as a pinnacle of her main spirit. The nature of this manifestation depends on the shaman&#146;s spirit, and is described in its entry.</p>
			<h>Spirit Animal</h>
			<p>By communing with the incredible powers of her spirit, the shaman forges a cherished bond with one specif ic servant of that spirit&#151;known as a spirit animal. A spirit animal is a creature chosen by a shaman to serve as a conduit, allowing her to more fully access the magic of her spirit on a daily basis. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal also grants her special powers. This ability uses the same rules as the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature and is treated as a familiar (see pages 78 and 82 of the Core Rulebook), except as noted below.</p>
			<p>A shaman uses her level as her effective wizard level when determining the abilities of her spirit animal. A shaman can select any familiar available to wizards to serve as her spirit animal, although her spirit animal is augmented by the power of her chosen spirit. Once selected, the spirit animal cannot be changed. Although a shaman&#146;s spirit animal uses the statistics of a specific animal, it is treated as an outsider with the native subtype for the purposes of spells and abilities that affect it.</p>
			<p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack with shaman levels for the purpose of determining any spirit animal abilities that depend on the shaman&#146;s level. If a shaman possesses such levels in other classes, her spirit animal always uses the shaman rules for spirit animals, not those used by familiars of other classes (such as witches, wizards, or sorcerers with the arcane bloodline). If the shaman has witch levels, her spirit animal also serves as the conduit to her patron and stores her witch spells. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal is treated as a familiar for the purposes of all spells, effects, and abilities that affect familiars.</p>
			<p>If a spirit animal is lost or dies, it can be replaced after 24 hours through a special ritual that consumes material components worth 500 gp per shaman level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. The new spirit animal must be of the same sort of creature as the previous one.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman&#146;s spirit animal gains specific abilities, depending upon the type of spirit selected by the shaman using her spirit class feature. These abilities affect the animal&#146;s appearance and grant it special abilities that can aid it in serving the shaman and the spirit it represents and is connected to. These abilities are described in the spirit animal section of each individual spirit description.</p>
			<p><b>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </b>If a shaman is 3rd level or higher, her spirit animal can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the shaman and the spirit animal are in contact at the time the shaman casts a touch spell, she can designate her animal as the &#147;toucher.&#148; The spirit animal can then deliver the touch spell just as the shaman would. If the shaman casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the shaman activates a hex, her spirit animal can be used to make the touch; she doesn&#146;t have to be in contact with the animal to use this ability with hexes.</p>

					<p>At 8th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her selected spirit. At 16th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed for the true version of her selected spirit.</p>
					<p>If the shaman takes levels in another class that grants a mystery (such as the oracle), the spirit and mystery must match, even if that means one of them must change. Subject to GM discretion, the shaman can change her former mystery or spirit to make them conform.</p>

					<p>A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>While most shamans of the waves spirit have powers associated with surface waters, deep shamans are tied to spirits from the depths. Some say that the first deep shamans served Besmara back when she was a water spirit, before she achieved full godhood.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>While some heroes speak to gods or consort with otherworldly muses, shamans commune with the spirits of the world and the energies that exist in every living thing. These divine adventurers draw upon their power to shape the world and expand the inf luence of their spiritual patrons. Shamans have strong ties to natural spirits. They form powerful bonds with particular spirits, and as their power grows they learn to call upon other spirits in times of need.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Shamans make for potent divine spellcasters, capable of using divine spells and the power of their spirits to aid their allies and destroy their foes. While they aren&#146;t the healers that clerics are, they can still fill that role when needed.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p>P <b>arent Class(es): </b>Oracle and witch.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shaman's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), and Survival (Wis).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>A shaman is proficient with all simple weapons, and with light and medium armor.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the shaman spell list. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;9. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1&#150;3 in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>
			<p><b>Aquatic Spirit Abilities (Su): </b>When used underwater, a deep shaman&#146;s wave strike deals lethal bludgeoning damage and pushes the target away 5 feet + an additional 5 feet for every 6 shaman levels she has. At 11th level, whenever the deep shaman is underwater, all weapons she holds are treated as if they had the impact special ability instead of quenching. Instead of a swim speed and the ability to breathe underwater, fluid mastery provides tremorsense with a range of 30 feet while in the water, and when underwater, fluid mastery&#146;s torrent deals 1d6 points of damage per shaman level in a 30-foot cone.</p>
			<p>This alters spirit ability and greater spirit ability.</p>
			<p><b>Brine Dragon Form (Su): </b>When a deep shaman gains access to the true version of the waves spirit, she can assume the form of a Large (or smaller) brine dragon as per form of the dragon II, with a line of acid breath weapon, acid resistance 20, and a swim speed of 60 feet. She can use this ability for 1 hour per shaman level each day, divided any way she chooses in 1 hour increments, though the spell&#146;s breath weapon limit applies across the whole day. Time she spends underwater doesn&#146;t count against this limit, but every minute (or fraction thereof ) that she spends flying expends 1 hour of her daily uses. At 18th level, she can assume the form of a Huge or smaller brine dragon as per form of the dragon III instead.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the elemental form of the true spirit ability.</p>
			<p><b>Deep Spirit: </b>A deep shaman must choose the waves spirit. The deep shaman must choose a spirit animal with the aquatic subtype, and it gains the amphibious special quality instead of gaining the ability to breathe in water. A deep shaman gains Swim as a class skill.</p>
			<p>This alters spirit, spirit animal, and the shaman&#146;s class skills.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Shamans can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;9. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit (Su): </b>A shaman forms a mystical bond with the spirits of the world. She forms a lasting bond with a single spirit (see Spirits on page 37), which grants a number of abilities and defines many of her other class features.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a shaman gains the spirit ability granted by her chosen spirit. She adds the spells granted by that spirit to the list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She also adds the hexes possessed by that spirit to the list of hexes that she can use with the hex and wandering hex class features.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her selected spirit. At 16th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed for the true version of her selected spirit.</p>
			<p>If the shaman takes levels in another class that grants a mystery (such as the oracle), the spirit and mystery must match, even if that means one of them must change. Subject to GM discretion, the shaman can change her former mystery or spirit to make them conform.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman forms a close bond with a spirit animal tied to her chosen spirit. This animal is her conduit to the spirit world, guiding her along the path to enlightenment. The animal also aids a shaman by granting her a special ability. See the Spirit Animal section on page 47.</p>
			<p>A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells. While the spirit animal does not store the spells like a witch&#146;s familiar does, the spirit animal serves as her conduit to divine power. If a shaman&#146;s spirit animal is slain, she cannot prepare new spells or use her spirit magic class feature until the spirit animal is replaced.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Magic: </b>A shaman can spontaneously cast a limited number of spells per day beyond those she prepared ahead of time. She has one spell slot per day of each shaman spell level she can cast, not including orisons. She can choose these spells from the list of spells granted by her spirits (see the spirit class feature and the wandering spirit class feature) at the time she casts them. She can enhance these spells using any metamagic feat that she knows, using up a higher-level spell slot as required by the feat and increasing the time to cast the spell (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p><b>Aquatic Hexes (Su): </b>When a deep shaman uses beckoning chill on a creature in the water, that creature becomes fatigued due to hypothermia for the duration, and it also becomes entangled if the creature takes damage from he deep shaman&#146;s spirit abilities and from spells and abilities with the water descriptor. Her crashing waves hex applies to her spirit abilities that deal damage as if they were spells with the water descriptor, raising her effective shaman level for those abilities. Instead of mist&#146;s shroud and watersight, she can select the two hexes below.</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a shaman learns one hex. At 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.</p>
			<p>Using a hex is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Spirit (Su): </b>At 4th level, a shaman can form a temporary bond with a spirit other than the one selected using her spirit class feature. She must make this selection each day when preparing her spells. While this feature is active, she gains the spirit ability granted by the spirit. She also adds the spells granted by that spirit to her list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She does not add the hexes from her wandering spirit to her list of hexes that she can choose from with the hex class feature. At 12th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit. At 20th level, she gains the ability listed in the true version of her wandering spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Hex: </b>At 6th level, a shaman can temporarily gain the use of one of the hexes possessed by either one of her spirits. She must make this selection each day when she prepares her spells. For the purposes of this ability, she can select any hex possessed by her spirit or wandering spirit. If she selects it from her wandering spirit, she loses the hex immediately if she bonds with another spirit, although she can then select a different hex to gain using this ability, from either her spirit or her new wandering spirit. At 14th level, a shaman can select two wandering hexes each day instead of one. This ability otherwise functions as the hex class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Manifestation (Su): </b>Upon reaching 20th level, a shaman undergoes a transformation as she manifests as a pinnacle of her main spirit. The nature of this manifestation depends on the shaman&#146;s spirit, and is described in its entry.</p>
			<h>Spirit Animal</h>
			<p>By communing with the incredible powers of her spirit, the shaman forges a cherished bond with one specif ic servant of that spirit&#151;known as a spirit animal. A spirit animal is a creature chosen by a shaman to serve as a conduit, allowing her to more fully access the magic of her spirit on a daily basis. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal also grants her special powers. This ability uses the same rules as the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature and is treated as a familiar (see pages 78 and 82 of the Core Rulebook), except as noted below.</p>
			<p>A shaman uses her level as her effective wizard level when determining the abilities of her spirit animal. A shaman can select any familiar available to wizards to serve as her spirit animal, although her spirit animal is augmented by the power of her chosen spirit. Once selected, the spirit animal cannot be changed. Although a shaman&#146;s spirit animal uses the statistics of a specific animal, it is treated as an outsider with the native subtype for the purposes of spells and abilities that affect it.</p>
			<p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack with shaman levels for the purpose of determining any spirit animal abilities that depend on the shaman&#146;s level. If a shaman possesses such levels in other classes, her spirit animal always uses the shaman rules for spirit animals, not those used by familiars of other classes (such as witches, wizards, or sorcerers with the arcane bloodline). If the shaman has witch levels, her spirit animal also serves as the conduit to her patron and stores her witch spells. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal is treated as a familiar for the purposes of all spells, effects, and abilities that affect familiars.</p>
			<p>If a spirit animal is lost or dies, it can be replaced after 24 hours through a special ritual that consumes material components worth 500 gp per shaman level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. The new spirit animal must be of the same sort of creature as the previous one.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman&#146;s spirit animal gains specific abilities, depending upon the type of spirit selected by the shaman using her spirit class feature. These abilities affect the animal&#146;s appearance and grant it special abilities that can aid it in serving the shaman and the spirit it represents and is connected to. These abilities are described in the spirit animal section of each individual spirit description.</p>
			<p><b>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </b>If a shaman is 3rd level or higher, her spirit animal can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the shaman and the spirit animal are in contact at the time the shaman casts a touch spell, she can designate her animal as the &#147;toucher.&#148; The spirit animal can then deliver the touch spell just as the shaman would. If the shaman casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the shaman activates a hex, her spirit animal can be used to make the touch; she doesn&#146;t have to be in contact with the animal to use this ability with hexes.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Crystal tenders are most often found among subterranean races and races bearing a strong connection to the earth. A crystal tender focuses on the spirits of metal and stone, using crystals as a means to focus the power of the spirits she venerates. Many crystal tenders take it upon themselves to guard rich gem veins and other mineral treasures from those who would mine them out of greed, much in the way that surface-dwelling druids might defend a sacred grove from woodcutters.</i></p>
			<p><i>The crystal tenders of Orv meditate within the Crystal Womb, often near the churning vortex that makes up the heart of the Vault. They learn to focus the cavern&#146;s energies through ley lines in the stone, and they study the birth of crystals within the Womb in order to mimic the process.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>While some heroes speak to gods or consort with otherworldly muses, shamans commune with the spirits of the world and the energies that exist in every living thing. These divine adventurers draw upon their power to shape the world and expand the inf luence of their spiritual patrons. Shamans have strong ties to natural spirits. They form powerful bonds with particular spirits, and as their power grows they learn to call upon other spirits in times of need.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Shamans make for potent divine spellcasters, capable of using divine spells and the power of their spirits to aid their allies and destroy their foes. While they aren&#146;t the healers that clerics are, they can still fill that role when needed.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>A shaman is proficient with all simple weapons, and with light and medium armor.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the shaman spell list. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;9. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1&#150;3 in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Shamans can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;9. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Scion of the Stones (Ex): </b>A crystal tender forms a mystic connection with the precious stones and gems she has sworn to protect. Her spirit animal always appears to be composed of a crystalline substance and gains a +2 bonus to its natural armor. Her spirit animal is treated as an outsider with both the earth and native subtypes, and counts as a crystalline creature for the purposes of spells and abilities. The unique nature of her spirit animal increases the cost of replacing it to 750 gp per shaman level.</p>
			<p>This alters spirit animal.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit (Su): </b>A shaman forms a mystical bond with the spirits of the world. She forms a lasting bond with a single spirit (see Spirits on page 37), which grants a number of abilities and defines many of her other class features.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a shaman gains the spirit ability granted by her chosen spirit. She adds the spells granted by that spirit to the list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She also adds the hexes possessed by that spirit to the list of hexes that she can use with the hex and wandering hex class features.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her selected spirit. At 16th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed for the true version of her selected spirit.</p>
			<p>If the shaman takes levels in another class that grants a mystery (such as the oracle), the spirit and mystery must match, even if that means one of them must change. Subject to GM discretion, the shaman can change her former mystery or spirit to make them conform.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman forms a close bond with a spirit animal tied to her chosen spirit. This animal is her conduit to the spirit world, guiding her along the path to enlightenment. The animal also aids a shaman by granting her a special ability. See the Spirit Animal section on page 47.</p>
			<p>A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells. While the spirit animal does not store the spells like a witch&#146;s familiar does, the spirit animal serves as her conduit to divine power. If a shaman&#146;s spirit animal is slain, she cannot prepare new spells or use her spirit magic class feature until the spirit animal is replaced.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Magic: </b>A shaman can spontaneously cast a limited number of spells per day beyond those she prepared ahead of time. She has one spell slot per day of each shaman spell level she can cast, not including orisons. She can choose these spells from the list of spells granted by her spirits (see the spirit class feature and the wandering spirit class feature) at the time she casts them. She can enhance these spells using any metamagic feat that she knows, using up a higher-level spell slot as required by the feat and increasing the time to cast the spell (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a shaman learns one hex. At 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.</p>
			<p>Using a hex is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Reciprocal Resonance (Su): </b>At 4th level, a crystal tender learns to form a temporary bond with a spirit of crystal. When selecting her wandering spirit, she can forgo gaining a spirit ability to instead grant herself and her spirit animal DR 1/adamantine as long as they&#146;re within 10 feet of one another. While benefiting from this ability, the crystal tender&#146;s skin takes on a crystalline sheen. The DR gained from this ability increases to 2/ adamantine at 8th level, 3/adamantine at 12th level, 4/adamantine at 16th level, and 5/adamantine at 20th level.</p>
			<p>This alters wandering spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Spirit (Su): </b>At 4th level, a shaman can form a temporary bond with a spirit other than the one selected using her spirit class feature. She must make this selection each day when preparing her spells. While this feature is active, she gains the spirit ability granted by the spirit. She also adds the spells granted by that spirit to her list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She does not add the hexes from her wandering spirit to her list of hexes that she can choose from with the hex class feature. At 12th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit. At 20th level, she gains the ability listed in the true version of her wandering spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Hex: </b>At 6th level, a shaman can temporarily gain the use of one of the hexes possessed by either one of her spirits. She must make this selection each day when she prepares her spells. For the purposes of this ability, she can select any hex possessed by her spirit or wandering spirit. If she selects it from her wandering spirit, she loses the hex immediately if she bonds with another spirit, although she can then select a different hex to gain using this ability, from either her spirit or her new wandering spirit. At 14th level, a shaman can select two wandering hexes each day instead of one. This ability otherwise functions as the hex class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Invoke Latent Facets (Su): </b>At 8th level, both a crystal tender and her spirit animal gain all of the benefits of any ioun stones worn by one another, as long as they&#146;re within 100 feet of each other. The crystal tender&#146;s spirit animal can also embed a number of ioun stones equal to the crystal tender&#146;s Charisma modifier into its crystalline form. Embedded ioun stones don&#146;t gain any additional abilities, save that they don&#146;t orbit the spirit animal and can&#146;t be separately targeted. A slain or unconscious spirit animal immediately loses all embedded ioun stones, which tumble to the ground beside its body.</p>
			<p>This replaces the shaman hex gained at 8th level.</p>
			<p><b>Cabochon Form (Sp): </b>At 20th level, as a standard action, a crystal tender can transform her body into a living gemstone as per iron body with a duration of 12 hours. Instead of being vulnerable to effects that can harm an iron golem while in this form, she is vulnerable to effects that can harm a crystalline creature (such as shatter). She can use this ability once per day.</p>
			<p>This replaces manifestation.</p>
			<h>Spirit Animal</h>
			<p>By communing with the incredible powers of her spirit, the shaman forges a cherished bond with one specif ic servant of that spirit&#151;known as a spirit animal. A spirit animal is a creature chosen by a shaman to serve as a conduit, allowing her to more fully access the magic of her spirit on a daily basis. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal also grants her special powers. This ability uses the same rules as the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature and is treated as a familiar (see pages 78 and 82 of the Core Rulebook), except as noted below.</p>
			<p>A shaman uses her level as her effective wizard level when determining the abilities of her spirit animal. A shaman can select any familiar available to wizards to serve as her spirit animal, although her spirit animal is augmented by the power of her chosen spirit. Once selected, the spirit animal cannot be changed. Although a shaman&#146;s spirit animal uses the statistics of a specific animal, it is treated as an outsider with the native subtype for the purposes of spells and abilities that affect it.</p>
			<p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack with shaman levels for the purpose of determining any spirit animal abilities that depend on the shaman&#146;s level. If a shaman possesses such levels in other classes, her spirit animal always uses the shaman rules for spirit animals, not those used by familiars of other classes (such as witches, wizards, or sorcerers with the arcane bloodline). If the shaman has witch levels, her spirit animal also serves as the conduit to her patron and stores her witch spells. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal is treated as a familiar for the purposes of all spells, effects, and abilities that affect familiars.</p>
			<p>If a spirit animal is lost or dies, it can be replaced after 24 hours through a special ritual that consumes material components worth 500 gp per shaman level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. The new spirit animal must be of the same sort of creature as the previous one.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman&#146;s spirit animal gains specific abilities, depending upon the type of spirit selected by the shaman using her spirit class feature. These abilities affect the animal&#146;s appearance and grant it special abilities that can aid it in serving the shaman and the spirit it represents and is connected to. These abilities are described in the spirit animal section of each individual spirit description.</p>
			<p><b>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </b>If a shaman is 3rd level or higher, her spirit animal can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the shaman and the spirit animal are in contact at the time the shaman casts a touch spell, she can designate her animal as the &#147;toucher.&#148; The spirit animal can then deliver the touch spell just as the shaman would. If the shaman casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the shaman activates a hex, her spirit animal can be used to make the touch; she doesn&#146;t have to be in contact with the animal to use this ability with hexes.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Though most shamans dole out banes and boons equally, a benefactor seeks to improve the lives of others by primarily offering powerful supportive abilities and magic to her allies and others she deems worthy.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>While some heroes speak to gods or consort with otherworldly muses, shamans commune with the spirits of the world and the energies that exist in every living thing. These divine adventurers draw upon their power to shape the world and expand the inf luence of their spiritual patrons. Shamans have strong ties to natural spirits. They form powerful bonds with particular spirits, and as their power grows they learn to call upon other spirits in times of need.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Shamans make for potent divine spellcasters, capable of using divine spells and the power of their spirits to aid their allies and destroy their foes. While they aren&#146;t the healers that clerics are, they can still fill that role when needed.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p>P <b>arent Class(es): </b>Oracle and witch.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shaman's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), and Survival (Wis).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>A shaman is proficient with all simple weapons, and with light and medium armor.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the shaman spell list. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;9. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1&#150;3 in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Shamans can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;9. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit (Su): </b>A shaman forms a mystical bond with the spirits of the world. She forms a lasting bond with a single spirit (see Spirits on page 37), which grants a number of abilities and defines many of her other class features.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a shaman gains the spirit ability granted by her chosen spirit. She adds the spells granted by that spirit to the list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She also adds the hexes possessed by that spirit to the list of hexes that she can use with the hex and wandering hex class features.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her selected spirit. At 16th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed for the true version of her selected spirit.</p>
			<p>If the shaman takes levels in another class that grants a mystery (such as the oracle), the spirit and mystery must match, even if that means one of them must change. Subject to GM discretion, the shaman can change her former mystery or spirit to make them conform.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman forms a close bond with a spirit animal tied to her chosen spirit. This animal is her conduit to the spirit world, guiding her along the path to enlightenment. The animal also aids a shaman by granting her a special ability. See the Spirit Animal section on page 47.</p>
			<p>A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells. While the spirit animal does not store the spells like a witch&#146;s familiar does, the spirit animal serves as her conduit to divine power. If a shaman&#146;s spirit animal is slain, she cannot prepare new spells or use her spirit magic class feature until the spirit animal is replaced.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Magic: </b>A shaman can spontaneously cast a limited number of spells per day beyond those she prepared ahead of time. She has one spell slot per day of each shaman spell level she can cast, not including orisons. She can choose these spells from the list of spells granted by her spirits (see the spirit class feature and the wandering spirit class feature) at the time she casts them. She can enhance these spells using any metamagic feat that she knows, using up a higher-level spell slot as required by the feat and increasing the time to cast the spell (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a shaman learns one hex. At 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.</p>
			<p>Using a hex is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Spirit (Su): </b>At 4th level, a shaman can form a temporary bond with a spirit other than the one selected using her spirit class feature. She must make this selection each day when preparing her spells. While this feature is active, she gains the spirit ability granted by the spirit. She also adds the spells granted by that spirit to her list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She does not add the hexes from her wandering spirit to her list of hexes that she can choose from with the hex class feature. At 12th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit. At 20th level, she gains the ability listed in the true version of her wandering spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Hex: </b>At 6th level, a shaman can temporarily gain the use of one of the hexes possessed by either one of her spirits. She must make this selection each day when she prepares her spells. For the purposes of this ability, she can select any hex possessed by her spirit or wandering spirit. If she selects it from her wandering spirit, she loses the hex immediately if she bonds with another spirit, although she can then select a different hex to gain using this ability, from either her spirit or her new wandering spirit. At 14th level, a shaman can select two wandering hexes each day instead of one. This ability otherwise functions as the hex class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Manifestation (Su): </b>Upon reaching 20th level, a shaman undergoes a transformation as she manifests as a pinnacle of her main spirit. The nature of this manifestation depends on the shaman&#146;s spirit, and is described in its entry.</p>
			<h>Spirit Animal</h>
			<p>By communing with the incredible powers of her spirit, the shaman forges a cherished bond with one specif ic servant of that spirit&#151;known as a spirit animal. A spirit animal is a creature chosen by a shaman to serve as a conduit, allowing her to more fully access the magic of her spirit on a daily basis. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal also grants her special powers. This ability uses the same rules as the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature and is treated as a familiar (see pages 78 and 82 of the Core Rulebook), except as noted below.</p>
			<p>A shaman uses her level as her effective wizard level when determining the abilities of her spirit animal. A shaman can select any familiar available to wizards to serve as her spirit animal, although her spirit animal is augmented by the power of her chosen spirit. Once selected, the spirit animal cannot be changed. Although a shaman&#146;s spirit animal uses the statistics of a specific animal, it is treated as an outsider with the native subtype for the purposes of spells and abilities that affect it.</p>
			<p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack with shaman levels for the purpose of determining any spirit animal abilities that depend on the shaman&#146;s level. If a shaman possesses such levels in other classes, her spirit animal always uses the shaman rules for spirit animals, not those used by familiars of other classes (such as witches, wizards, or sorcerers with the arcane bloodline). If the shaman has witch levels, her spirit animal also serves as the conduit to her patron and stores her witch spells. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal is treated as a familiar for the purposes of all spells, effects, and abilities that affect familiars.</p>
			<p>If a spirit animal is lost or dies, it can be replaced after 24 hours through a special ritual that consumes material components worth 500 gp per shaman level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. The new spirit animal must be of the same sort of creature as the previous one.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman&#146;s spirit animal gains specific abilities, depending upon the type of spirit selected by the shaman using her spirit class feature. These abilities affect the animal&#146;s appearance and grant it special abilities that can aid it in serving the shaman and the spirit it represents and is connected to. These abilities are described in the spirit animal section of each individual spirit description.</p>
			<p><b>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </b>If a shaman is 3rd level or higher, her spirit animal can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the shaman and the spirit animal are in contact at the time the shaman casts a touch spell, she can designate her animal as the &#147;toucher.&#148; The spirit animal can then deliver the touch spell just as the shaman would. If the shaman casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the shaman activates a hex, her spirit animal can be used to make the touch; she doesn&#146;t have to be in contact with the animal to use this ability with hexes.</p>

To the animist, negative conditions manifest as anthropomorphic spirits or are caused by such spirits (visited upon the creature by bad magic). Either way, the animist can attempt to persuade the spirit to leave its victim alone, thus performing a miraculous healing. As the animist grows in power, he can simply inform these spirits that they are unwelcome and command them to depart.</p>
					<p>The animist can attempt a Diplomacy check to persuade the condition&#146;s spirit to leave. Conditions the animist can affect are ranked from minor to dire, with each category having an accompanying Diplomacy DC (see below). The animist cannot take 10 or 20 on the check or receive aid from any creature except another shaman. Failure by 5 or less means the condition spirit is willing to leave the target and transfer to the animist for the rest of the duration or until cured; this happens only if the animist is willing. Failure by 10 or more means that not only is the target inflicted with the condition, but the animist is as well (whether or not he is willing) for the remaining duration or until cured.</p>
					<p><i>Minor Conditions (DC 15): </i>Fatigued, shaken, and sickened.</p>
					<p><i>Major Conditions (DC 20): </i>Dazed and staggered.</p>
					<p><i>Severe Conditions (DC 25): </i>Exhausted, frightened, and nauseated.</p>
					<p><i>Dire Conditions (DC 30): </i>Blinded, deafened, paralyzed, and stunned.</p>
					<p>The animist can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 his shaman level + his Wisdom modifier. Using this ability is a standard action that requires no contact or shared language with the target, but it relies on audible components and the target must be within 30 feet. If a target is afflicted with multiple conditions, the animist targets one condition at a time (of her choosing). The animist cannot use this ability on himself.</p>
					<p>At 5th level, the animist can use this ability to exorcise minor conditions without needing to attempt a Diplomacy check. He can dispatch major conditions without a roll at 9th level, severe conditions at 13th level, and dire conditions at 17th level. Doing so still requires one use of this ability per condition.</p>

					<p>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a shaman learns one hex.

					<p>At 8th level, the animist can attempt to end effects that control a creature or object, such as magic jar, possess objectUM, dominate person, and dominate monster, or possessing entities such as ghosts. This is a full-round action that requires the animist to touch the target. The possessing or dominating creature must attempt a Will save with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman level + her Wisdom modifier. Failure means that the controlling effect ends or the entity is immediately cast out of the target, as appropriate. If the possessing entity is exorcised, it cannot attempt to dominate or possess that target again for 24 hours. The animist can exorcise the same entity out of different targets, but once the entity successfully saves against the animist&#146;s exorcism, it cannot be affected by this ability again for 24 hours. This ability replaces the hex gained at 8th level.</p>

					<p>At 10th level, the animist can attempt to possess creatures or objects as magic jar or possess objectUM. When the animist is attempting to possess the creature, his familiar acts as the jar and must be within 10 feet when the animist attempts to possess a creature. The animist&#146;s soul can perceive his surroundings through the familiar&#146;s senses, clearly evaluate potential targets for possession, and communicate with his familiar telepathically. The familiar retains its autonomy while acting as the jar, and is not harmed by being used as a vessel for the animist&#146;s soul. The animist can use this ability once per day at 10th level, plus an additional time per day every 4 levels thereafter. This ability replaces the hex gained at 10th level.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Even among mystical practitioners, the animist has a strange perspective and even stranger magic. The animist perceives that all things have a spirit, including objects, constructs, illnesses, buildings, and the environment.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>While some heroes speak to gods or consort with otherworldly muses, shamans commune with the spirits of the world and the energies that exist in every living thing. These divine adventurers draw upon their power to shape the world and expand the inf luence of their spiritual patrons. Shamans have strong ties to natural spirits. They form powerful bonds with particular spirits, and as their power grows they learn to call upon other spirits in times of need.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Shamans make for potent divine spellcasters, capable of using divine spells and the power of their spirits to aid their allies and destroy their foes. While they aren&#146;t the healers that clerics are, they can still fill that role when needed.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p>P <b>arent Class(es): </b>Oracle and witch.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shaman's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), and Survival (Wis).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>A shaman is proficient with all simple weapons, and with light and medium armor.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the shaman spell list. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
			<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;9. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1&#150;3 in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>
			<p><b>Animist Spirit Magic: </b>The animist adds the following spells to the list of spells he can cast using spirit magic: speak with animals (1st), skinsendUM (2nd), speak with plants (3rd), malfunctionUM (4th), dream (5th), speak with stone (6th), control constructUM (7th), trap the soul (8th), soul bind (9th). This ability replaces the spirit magic spells gained from the shaman&#146;s spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Shamans can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;9. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit (Su): </b>A shaman forms a mystical bond with the spirits of the world. She forms a lasting bond with a single spirit (see Spirits on page 37), which grants a number of abilities and defines many of her other class features.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a shaman gains the spirit ability granted by her chosen spirit. She adds the spells granted by that spirit to the list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She also adds the hexes possessed by that spirit to the list of hexes that she can use with the hex and wandering hex class features.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her selected spirit. At 16th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed for the true version of her selected spirit.</p>
			<p>If the shaman takes levels in another class that grants a mystery (such as the oracle), the spirit and mystery must match, even if that means one of them must change. Subject to GM discretion, the shaman can change her former mystery or spirit to make them conform.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman forms a close bond with a spirit animal tied to her chosen spirit. This animal is her conduit to the spirit world, guiding her along the path to enlightenment. The animal also aids a shaman by granting her a special ability. See the Spirit Animal section on page 47.</p>
			<p>A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells. While the spirit animal does not store the spells like a witch&#146;s familiar does, the spirit animal serves as her conduit to divine power. If a shaman&#146;s spirit animal is slain, she cannot prepare new spells or use her spirit magic class feature until the spirit animal is replaced.</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a shaman learns one hex. At 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.</p>
			<p>Using a hex is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level + the shaman&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Wrangle Condition (Su): </b>At 2nd level, the animist interacts directly with unwholesome spirits of the ills that trouble him or his people. To the animist, negative conditions manifest as anthropomorphic spirits or are caused by such spirits (visited upon the creature by bad magic). Either way, the animist can attempt to persuade the spirit to leave its victim alone, thus performing a miraculous healing. As the animist grows in power, he can simply inform these spirits that they are unwelcome and command them to depart.</p>
			<p>The animist can attempt a Diplomacy check to persuade the condition&#146;s spirit to leave. Conditions the animist can affect are ranked from minor to dire, with each category having an accompanying Diplomacy DC (see below). The animist cannot take 10 or 20 on the check or receive aid from any creature except another shaman. Failure by 5 or less means the condition spirit is willing to leave the target and transfer to the animist for the rest of the duration or until cured; this happens only if the animist is willing. Failure by 10 or more means that not only is the target inflicted with the condition, but the animist is as well (whether or not he is willing) for the remaining duration or until cured.</p>
			<p>Minor Conditions (DC 15): Fatigued, shaken, and sickened.</p>
			<p>Major Conditions (DC 20): Dazed and staggered.</p>
			<p>Severe Conditions (DC 25): Exhausted, frightened, and nauseated.</p>
			<p>Dire Conditions (DC 30): Blinded, deafened, paralyzed, and stunned.</p>
			<p>The animist can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 his shaman level + his Wisdom modifier. Using this ability is a standard action that requires no contact or shared language with the target, but it relies on audible components and the target must be within 30 feet. If a target is afflicted with multiple conditions, the animist targets one condition at a time (of her choosing). The animist cannot use this ability on himself.</p>
			<p>At 5th level, the animist can use this ability to exorcise minor conditions without needing to attempt a Diplomacy check. He can dispatch major conditions without a roll at 9th level, severe conditions at 13th level, and dire conditions at 17th level. Doing so still requires one use of this ability per condition.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the hex gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Spirit (Su): </b>At 4th level, a shaman can form a temporary bond with a spirit other than the one selected using her spirit class feature. She must make this selection each day when preparing her spells. While this feature is active, she gains the spirit ability granted by the spirit. She also adds the spells granted by that spirit to her list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She does not add the hexes from her wandering spirit to her list of hexes that she can choose from with the hex class feature. At 12th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit. At 20th level, she gains the ability listed in the true version of her wandering spirit.</p>
			<p><b>Wandering Hex: </b>At 6th level, a shaman can temporarily gain the use of one of the hexes possessed by either one of her spirits. She must make this selection each day when she prepares her spells. For the purposes of this ability, she can select any hex possessed by her spirit or wandering spirit. If she selects it from her wandering spirit, she loses the hex immediately if she bonds with another spirit, although she can then select a different hex to gain using this ability, from either her spirit or her new wandering spirit. At 14th level, a shaman can select two wandering hexes each day instead of one. This ability otherwise functions as the hex class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Exorcism (Su): </b>At 8th level, the animist can attempt to end effects that control a creature or object, such as magic jar, possess objectUM, dominate person, and dominate monster, or possessing entities such as ghosts. This is a full-round action that requires the animist to touch the target. The possessing or dominating creature must attempt a Will save with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman level + her Wisdom modifier. Failure means that the controlling effect ends or the entity is immediately cast out of the target, as appropriate. If the possessing entity is exorcised, it cannot attempt to dominate or possess that target again for 24 hours. The animist can exorcise the same entity out of different targets, but once the entity successfully saves against the animist&#146;s exorcism, it cannot be affected by this ability again for 24 hours. This ability replaces the hex gained at 8th level.</p>
			<p><b>Dominate Spirit (Sp): </b>At 10th level, the animist can attempt to possess creatures or objects as magic jar or possess objectUM. When the animist is attempting to possess the creature, his familiar acts as the jar and must be within 10 feet when the animist attempts to possess a creature. The animist&#146;s soul can perceive his surroundings through the familiar&#146;s senses, clearly evaluate potential targets for possession, and communicate with his familiar telepathically. The familiar retains its autonomy while acting as the jar, and is not harmed by being used as a vessel for the animist&#146;s soul. The animist can use this ability once per day at 10th level, plus an additional time per day every 4 levels thereafter. This ability replaces the hex gained at 10th level.</p>
			<p><b>Contact with the Spirit World (Su): </b>At 12th level, the shaman can interact with incorporeal entities as if his unarmed strikes and melee weapons had the ghost touch weapon special ability. While using this ability, he can also see nearby ethereal entities and likewise strike at them as if they were incorporeal. He can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his shaman level. The rounds need not be consecutive. This ability replaces the hex gained at 12th level.</p>
			<p><b>Etherealness (Sp) </b>: At 18th level, the animist can cast etherealness once per day as a spell-like ability. This ability replaces the hex gained at 18th level.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Shaman (Sp): </b>At 20th level, the animist can use ethereal jaunt as at will as a spell-like ability, and cast astral projection once per day as a spell-like ability. This ability replaces manifestation.</p>
			<h>Spirit Animal</h>
			<p>By communing with the incredible powers of her spirit, the shaman forges a cherished bond with one specif ic servant of that spirit&#151;known as a spirit animal. A spirit animal is a creature chosen by a shaman to serve as a conduit, allowing her to more fully access the magic of her spirit on a daily basis. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal also grants her special powers. This ability uses the same rules as the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature and is treated as a familiar (see pages 78 and 82 of the Core Rulebook), except as noted below.</p>
			<p>A shaman uses her level as her effective wizard level when determining the abilities of her spirit animal. A shaman can select any familiar available to wizards to serve as her spirit animal, although her spirit animal is augmented by the power of her chosen spirit. Once selected, the spirit animal cannot be changed. Although a shaman&#146;s spirit animal uses the statistics of a specific animal, it is treated as an outsider with the native subtype for the purposes of spells and abilities that affect it.</p>
			<p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack with shaman levels for the purpose of determining any spirit animal abilities that depend on the shaman&#146;s level. If a shaman possesses such levels in other classes, her spirit animal always uses the shaman rules for spirit animals, not those used by familiars of other classes (such as witches, wizards, or sorcerers with the arcane bloodline). If the shaman has witch levels, her spirit animal also serves as the conduit to her patron and stores her witch spells. The shaman&#146;s spirit animal is treated as a familiar for the purposes of all spells, effects, and abilities that affect familiars.</p>
			<p>If a spirit animal is lost or dies, it can be replaced after 24 hours through a special ritual that consumes material components worth 500 gp per shaman level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. The new spirit animal must be of the same sort of creature as the previous one.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a shaman&#146;s spirit animal gains specific abilities, depending upon the type of spirit selected by the shaman using her spirit class feature. These abilities affect the animal&#146;s appearance and grant it special abilities that can aid it in serving the shaman and the spirit it represents and is connected to. These abilities are described in the spirit animal section of each individual spirit description.</p>
			<p><b>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </b>If a shaman is 3rd level or higher, her spirit animal can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the shaman and the spirit animal are in contact at the time the shaman casts a touch spell, she can designate her animal as the &#147;toucher.&#148; The spirit animal can then deliver the touch spell just as the shaman would. If the shaman casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the shaman activates a hex, her spirit animal can be used to make the touch; she doesn&#146;t have to be in contact with the animal to use this ability with hexes.</p>
