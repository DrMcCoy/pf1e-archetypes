				<name type="string">Flurry of Blows</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a monk can make a flurry of blows as a full-attack action. When making a flurry of blows, the monk can make one additional attack at his highest base attack bonus. This additional attack stacks with the bonus attacks from haste and other similar effects. When using this ability, the monk can make these attacks with any combination of his unarmed strikes and weapons that have the monk special weapon quality. He takes no penalty for using multiple weapons when making a flurry of blows, but he does not gain any additional attacks beyond what&#146;s already granted by the flurry for doing so. (He can still gain additional attacks from a high base attack bonus, from this ability, and from haste and similar effects).</p>
					<p>At 11th level, a monk can make an additional attack at his highest base attack bonus whenever he makes a flurry of blows. This stacks with the first attack from this ability and additional attacks from haste and similar effects.</p>

					<p>At 1st level, the monk gains Stunning Fist as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. At 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, the monk gains the ability to apply a new condition to the target of his Stunning Fist. This condition replaces stunning the target for 1 round, and a successful saving throw still negates the effect. At 4th level, the monk can choose to make the target fatigued. At 8th level, he can make the target sickened for 1 minute. At 12th level, he can make the target staggered for 1d6+1 rounds. At 16th level, he can permanently blind or deafen the target. At 20th level, he can paralyze the target for 1d6+1 rounds. The monk must choose which condition will apply before the attack roll is made. These effects do not stack with themselves (a creature fatigued by Stunning Fist cannot become exhausted if hit by Stunning Fist again), but additional hits do increase the duration.</p>

				<name type="string">Unarmed Strike</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A monk&#146;s attacks can be with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk can make unarmed strikes with his hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk can apply his full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all his unarmed strikes. A monk&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, although he can choose to deal nonlethal damage with no penalty on his attack roll. He can make this choice while grappling as well.</p>
					<p>A monk&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
					<p>The damage dealt by a monk&#146;s unarmed strike is determined by the unarmed damage column on Table 1&#150;2: Monk. The damage listed is for Medium monks. The damage for Small or Large monks is listed below.</p>

				<name type="string">Evasion</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 2nd level, a monk can avoid damage from many area-effect attacks. If a monk succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>

				<name type="string">Ki Pool</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 3rd level, a monk gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy he can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in a monk&#146;s ki pool is equal to 1/2 his monk level + his Wisdom modifier. As long as he has at least 1 point in his ki pool, he can make a ki strike. At 3rd level, ki strike allows his unarmed attacks to be treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 7th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 10th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 16th level, his unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
					<p>By spending 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action, a monk can make one additional unarmed strike at his highest attack bonus when making a flurry of blows attack. This bonus attack stacks with all bonus attacks gained from flurry of blows, as well as those from haste and similar effects. A monk gains additional powers that consume points from his ki pool as he gains levels.</p>
					<p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>

Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if he were a member of his previous creature type. Finally, the monk gains the ability to enter a state of perfect calm. During this time, the monk can take no actions, but he does regain ki at the rate of 1 point per 10 minutes spent at calm.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>-</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Physical and mental perfection&#151;that is the life goal of every monk. For these skilled warriors, martial prowess and mental clarity are one and the same. Capable of pummeling foes with both f ist and weapon, monks are among the more versatile combatants on the battlef ield. Monks are also able to harness their ki, a spiritual life force that resides within, allowing them to perform amazing acts of acrobatics and mystical skill. All of this depends on incredible discipline and focus, and monks spend their entire lives perfecting these arts.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>Much of the monk has been reworked, including its base attack bonus, Hit Die, saves, and many of its special abilities. The result is a version of the monk that not only is easier to play, but also possesses a great deal more versatility. Flurry of blows is now much simpler to use in play. Many of the higher-level abilities of the monk, such as abundant step and quivering palm, have been incorporated into the new system of ki powers. As a monk advances in level, he can select from a variety of ki powers, allowing the player to truly customize his character.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any lawful.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p>S <b>tarting Wealth: </b>1d6 x 10 gp (average 35 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Monk (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Monks are proficient with the club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe, javelin, kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, short sword, shortspear, shuriken, siangham, sling, spear, and any weapon with the monk special weapon quality.</p>
			<p>Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields.</p>
			<p>When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses his AC bonus, as well as his fast movement and flurry of blows abilities.</p>
			<p><b>AC Bonus (Ex): </b>When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds his Wisdom bonus (if any) to his AC and CMD. In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC and CMD at 4th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every four monk levels thereafter, up to a maximum of +5 at 20th level.</p>
			<p>These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is flat-footed. He loses these bonuses when he is immobilized or helpless, when he wears any armor, when he carries a shield, or when he carries a medium or heavy load.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat: </b>At 1st level, 2nd level, and every 4 levels thereafter, a monk can select a bonus feat. These feats must be taken from the following list: Catch Off-Guard, Combat Reflexes, Deflect Arrows, Dodge, Improved Grapple, Scorpion Style, and Throw Anything. At 6th level, the following feats are added to the list: Gorgon&#146;s Fist, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Disarm, Improved Feint, Improved Trip, and Mobility. At 10th level, the following feats are added to the list: Improved Critical, Medusa&#146;s Wrath, Snatch Arrows, and Spring Attack. A monk need not have any of the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.</p>
			<p><b>Flurry of Blows (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a monk can make a flurry of blows as a full-attack action. When making a flurry of blows, the monk can make one additional attack at his highest base attack bonus. This additional attack stacks with the bonus attacks from haste and other similar effects. When using this ability, the monk can make these attacks with any combination of his unarmed strikes and weapons that have the monk special weapon quality. He takes no penalty for using multiple weapons when making a flurry of blows, but he does not gain any additional attacks beyond what&#146;s already granted by the flurry for doing so. (He can still gain additional attacks from a high base attack bonus, from this ability, and from haste and similar effects).</p>
			<p>At 11th level, a monk can make an additional attack at his highest base attack bonus whenever he makes a flurry of blows. This stacks with the first attack from this ability and additional attacks from haste and similar effects.</p>
			<p><b>Stunning Fist (Ex): </b>At 1st level, the monk gains Stunning Fist as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. At 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, the monk gains the ability to apply a new condition to the target of his Stunning Fist. This condition replaces stunning the target for 1 round, and a successful saving throw still negates the effect. At 4th level, the monk can choose to make the target fatigued. At 8th level, he can make the target sickened for 1 minute. At 12th level, he can make the target staggered for 1d6+1 rounds. At 16th level, he can permanently blind or deafen the target. At 20th level, he can paralyze the target for 1d6+1 rounds. The monk must choose which condition will apply before the attack roll is made. These effects do not stack with themselves (a creature fatigued by Stunning Fist cannot become exhausted if hit by Stunning Fist again), but additional hits do increase the duration.</p>
			<p><b>Unarmed Strike (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A monk&#146;s attacks can be with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk can make unarmed strikes with his hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk can apply his full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all his unarmed strikes. A monk&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, although he can choose to deal nonlethal damage with no penalty on his attack roll. He can make this choice while grappling as well.</p>
			<p>A monk&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
			<p>The damage dealt by a monk&#146;s unarmed strike is determined by the unarmed damage column on Table 1&#150;2: Monk. The damage listed is for Medium monks. The damage for Small or Large monks is listed below.</p>

			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a monk can avoid damage from many area-effect attacks. If a monk succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a monk gains an enhancement bonus to his land speed, as shown on Table 1&#150;2. A monk in armor or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.</p>
			<p><b>Ki Pool (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a monk gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy he can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in a monk&#146;s ki pool is equal to 1/2 his monk level + his Wisdom modifier. As long as he has at least 1 point in his ki pool, he can make a ki strike. At 3rd level, ki strike allows his unarmed attacks to be treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 7th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 10th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 16th level, his unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
			<p>By spending 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action, a monk can make one additional unarmed strike at his highest attack bonus when making a flurry of blows attack. This bonus attack stacks with all bonus attacks gained from flurry of blows, as well as those from haste and similar effects. A monk gains additional powers that consume points from his ki pool as he gains levels.</p>
			<p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
			<p><b>Ki Powers (Su): </b>At 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a monk can select one ki power. These powers allow the monk to perform amazing feats of mystical power and acrobatic prowess by expending points from his ki pool. Once a ki power is selected, it cannot be changed. Some ki powers require the monk to be of a specific level or higher before they can be chosen. Unless otherwise noted, a monk cannot select an individual ki power more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Still Mind (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a monk gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against enchantment spells and effects.</p>
			<p><b>Purity of Body (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a monk gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.</p>
			<p><b>Style Strike (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a monk can learn one type of style strike. Whenever he makes a flurry of blows, he can designate one of his unarmed strikes as a style strike. This attack is resolved as normal, but it has an additional effect depending on the type of strike chosen. At 9th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, a monk learns an additional style strike. He must choose which style strike to apply before the attack roll is made. At 15th level, he can designate up to two of his unarmed strikes each round as a style strike, and each one can be a different type. The monk can choose from any of the following strikes.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a monk&#146;s evasion ability improves. He still takes no damage on successful Reflex saving throws against attacks, but henceforth he takes only half damage on failed saves. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Tongue of the Sun and Moon (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a monk can understand and speak with any living creature, as if under a permanent tongues effect.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex): </b>At 17th level, a monk no longer takes penalties to his ability scores for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any such penalties that he has already taken, however, remain in place. Age bonuses still accrue, and the monk still dies of old age when his time is up.</p>
			<p><b>Flawless Mind: </b>At 19th level, a monk gains total control over his mental faculties. Whenever he attempts a Will save, he can roll twice and take the better result. If he fails a Will saving throw against a spell or effect that has a duration longer than 1 hour, the monk can attempt a new saving throw at the end of each hour to end the effect.</p>
			<p><b>Perfect Self: </b>At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical creature. He is forevermore treated as an outsider rather than a humanoid (or whatever his original creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects. Additionally, the monk gains damage reduction 10/chaotic, which allows him to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a nonchaotic weapon. Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if he were a member of his previous creature type. Finally, the monk gains the ability to enter a state of perfect calm. During this time, the monk can take no actions, but he does regain ki at the rate of 1 point per 10 minutes spent at calm. He cannot use this ability to gain an amount of ki in excess of his maximum.</p>
			<h>Ex-Monks</h>
			<p>A monk who becomes nonlawful cannot gain new levels as a monk but retains all monk abilities.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a monk can make a flurry of blows as a full-attack action. When making a flurry of blows, the monk can make one additional attack at his highest base attack bonus. This additional attack stacks with the bonus attacks from haste and other similar effects. When using this ability, the monk can make these attacks with any combination of his unarmed strikes and weapons that have the monk special weapon quality. He takes no penalty for using multiple weapons when making a flurry of blows, but he does not gain any additional attacks beyond what&#146;s already granted by the flurry for doing so. (He can still gain additional attacks from a high base attack bonus, from this ability, and from haste and similar effects).</p>
					<p>At 11th level, a monk can make an additional attack at his highest base attack bonus whenever he makes a flurry of blows. This stacks with the first attack from this ability and additional attacks from haste and similar effects.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, while using the Hurricane Punch feat, the windstep master can bull rush a target up to two size categories larger. At 12th level, the windstep master&#146;s target can be up to three size categories larger. At 20th level, the target can be of any size category.</p>
					<p>At 8th level, when the windstep master uses the Hurricane Punch feat to successfully bull rush a creature, he can push the creature back an additional 5 feet. At 16th level, he can push the creature back an additional 10 feet.</p>

				<name type="string">Unarmed Strike</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A monk&#146;s attacks can be with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk can make unarmed strikes with his hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk can apply his full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all his unarmed strikes. A monk&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, although he can choose to deal nonlethal damage with no penalty on his attack roll. He can make this choice while grappling as well.</p>
					<p>A monk&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
					<p>The damage dealt by a monk&#146;s unarmed strike is determined by the unarmed damage column on Table 1&#150;2: Monk. The damage listed is for Medium monks. The damage for Small or Large monks is listed below.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 3rd level, a monk gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy he can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in a monk&#146;s ki pool is equal to 1/2 his monk level + his Wisdom modifier. As long as he has at least 1 point in his ki pool, he can make a ki strike. At 3rd level, ki strike allows his unarmed attacks to be treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 7th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 10th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 16th level, his unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
					<p>By spending 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action, a monk can make one additional unarmed strike at his highest attack bonus when making a flurry of blows attack. This bonus attack stacks with all bonus attacks gained from flurry of blows, as well as those from haste and similar effects. A monk gains additional powers that consume points from his ki pool as he gains levels.</p>
					<p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Most monks are agile and fleet of foot, but few can rival a windstep master&#146;s lightness of step. Windstep masters train in mountaintop monasteries and other holy houses dedicated to the wind, such as the Monastery of Unfolding Wind in Niswan.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Physical and mental perfection&#151;that is the life goal of every monk. For these skilled warriors, martial prowess and mental clarity are one and the same. Capable of pummeling foes with both f ist and weapon, monks are among the more versatile combatants on the battlef ield. Monks are also able to harness their ki, a spiritual life force that resides within, allowing them to perform amazing acts of acrobatics and mystical skill. All of this depends on incredible discipline and focus, and monks spend their entire lives perfecting these arts.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>Much of the monk has been reworked, including its base attack bonus, Hit Die, saves, and many of its special abilities. The result is a version of the monk that not only is easier to play, but also possesses a great deal more versatility. Flurry of blows is now much simpler to use in play. Many of the higher-level abilities of the monk, such as abundant step and quivering palm, have been incorporated into the new system of ki powers. As a monk advances in level, he can select from a variety of ki powers, allowing the player to truly customize his character.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any lawful.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p>S <b>tarting Wealth: </b>1d6 x 10 gp (average 35 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Monk (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex), and Swim (Str).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Monks are proficient with the club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe, javelin, kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, short sword, shortspear, shuriken, siangham, sling, spear, and any weapon with the monk special weapon quality.</p>
			<p>Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields.</p>
			<p>When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses his AC bonus, as well as his fast movement and flurry of blows abilities.</p>
			<p><b>AC Bonus (Ex): </b>When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds his Wisdom bonus (if any) to his AC and CMD. In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC and CMD at 4th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every four monk levels thereafter, up to a maximum of +5 at 20th level.</p>
			<p>These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is flat-footed. He loses these bonuses when he is immobilized or helpless, when he wears any armor, when he carries a shield, or when he carries a medium or heavy load.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat: </b>At 1st level, 2nd level, and every 4 levels thereafter, a monk can select a bonus feat. These feats must be taken from the following list: Catch Off-Guard, Combat Reflexes, Deflect Arrows, Dodge, Improved Grapple, Scorpion Style, and Throw Anything. At 6th level, the following feats are added to the list: Gorgon&#146;s Fist, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Disarm, Improved Feint, Improved Trip, and Mobility. At 10th level, the following feats are added to the list: Improved Critical, Medusa&#146;s Wrath, Snatch Arrows, and Spring Attack. A monk need not have any of the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.</p>
			<p><b>Flurry of Blows (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a monk can make a flurry of blows as a full-attack action. When making a flurry of blows, the monk can make one additional attack at his highest base attack bonus. This additional attack stacks with the bonus attacks from haste and other similar effects. When using this ability, the monk can make these attacks with any combination of his unarmed strikes and weapons that have the monk special weapon quality. He takes no penalty for using multiple weapons when making a flurry of blows, but he does not gain any additional attacks beyond what&#146;s already granted by the flurry for doing so. (He can still gain additional attacks from a high base attack bonus, from this ability, and from haste and similar effects).</p>
			<p>At 11th level, a monk can make an additional attack at his highest base attack bonus whenever he makes a flurry of blows. This stacks with the first attack from this ability and additional attacks from haste and similar effects.</p>
			<p><b>Hurricane Punch (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a windstep master gains Hurricane Punch (see page 19) as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. While using this feat, he doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity, even if he doesn&#146;t have the Improved Bull Rush feat.</p>
			<p>At 4th level, while using the Hurricane Punch feat, the windstep master can bull rush a target up to two size categories larger. At 12th level, the windstep master&#146;s target can be up to three size categories larger. At 20th level, the target can be of any size category.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, when the windstep master uses the Hurricane Punch feat to successfully bull rush a creature, he can push the creature back an additional 5 feet. At 16th level, he can push the creature back an additional 10 feet.</p>
			<p><b>Unarmed Strike (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A monk&#146;s attacks can be with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk can make unarmed strikes with his hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk can apply his full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all his unarmed strikes. A monk&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, although he can choose to deal nonlethal damage with no penalty on his attack roll. He can make this choice while grappling as well.</p>
			<p>A monk&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
			<p>The damage dealt by a monk&#146;s unarmed strike is determined by the unarmed damage column on Table 1&#150;2: Monk. The damage listed is for Medium monks. The damage for Small or Large monks is listed below.</p>

			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a monk can avoid damage from many area-effect attacks. If a monk succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a monk gains an enhancement bonus to his land speed, as shown on Table 1&#150;2. A monk in armor or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.</p>
			<p><b>Ki Pool (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a monk gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy he can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in a monk&#146;s ki pool is equal to 1/2 his monk level + his Wisdom modifier. As long as he has at least 1 point in his ki pool, he can make a ki strike. At 3rd level, ki strike allows his unarmed attacks to be treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 7th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 10th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 16th level, his unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
			<p>By spending 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action, a monk can make one additional unarmed strike at his highest attack bonus when making a flurry of blows attack. This bonus attack stacks with all bonus attacks gained from flurry of blows, as well as those from haste and similar effects. A monk gains additional powers that consume points from his ki pool as he gains levels.</p>
			<p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
			<p><b>Ki Powers (Su): </b>At 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a monk can select one ki power. These powers allow the monk to perform amazing feats of mystical power and acrobatic prowess by expending points from his ki pool. Once a ki power is selected, it cannot be changed. Some ki powers require the monk to be of a specific level or higher before they can be chosen. Unless otherwise noted, a monk cannot select an individual ki power more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Still Mind (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a monk gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against enchantment spells and effects.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Ki (Su): </b>At 4th level, the windstep master can spend 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action to sustain his wind step for 1 minute. During this time, the windstep master can remain airborne even if he doesn&#146;t reach a solid surface. He can also spend 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action to increase his wind step distance by 20 feet for 1 round. The windstep master does not gain the ability to spend ki to increase his base speed by 20 feet for 1 round.</p>
			<p><b>Wind Step (Su): </b>At 4th level, the windstep master&#146;s steps become supernaturally light. As a move action, he can use air walk (as per the spell) up to a distance equal to his fast movement bonus. He must reach a solid, level surface able to support his weight by the end of his turn or he falls.</p>
			<p><b>Purity of Body (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a monk gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.</p>
			<p><b>Style Strike (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a monk can learn one type of style strike. Whenever he makes a flurry of blows, he can designate one of his unarmed strikes as a style strike. This attack is resolved as normal, but it has an additional effect depending on the type of strike chosen. At 9th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, a monk learns an additional style strike. He must choose which style strike to apply before the attack roll is made. At 15th level, he can designate up to two of his unarmed strikes each round as a style strike, and each one can be a different type. The monk can choose from any of the following strikes.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a monk&#146;s evasion ability improves. He still takes no damage on successful Reflex saving throws against attacks, but henceforth he takes only half damage on failed saves. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Tongue of the Sun and Moon (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a monk can understand and speak with any living creature, as if under a permanent tongues effect.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex): </b>At 17th level, a monk no longer takes penalties to his ability scores for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any such penalties that he has already taken, however, remain in place. Age bonuses still accrue, and the monk still dies of old age when his time is up.</p>
			<p><b>Flawless Mind: </b>At 19th level, a monk gains total control over his mental faculties. Whenever he attempts a Will save, he can roll twice and take the better result. If he fails a Will saving throw against a spell or effect that has a duration longer than 1 hour, the monk can attempt a new saving throw at the end of each hour to end the effect.</p>
			<p><b>Perfect Self: </b>At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical creature. He is forevermore treated as an outsider rather than a humanoid (or whatever his original creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects. Additionally, the monk gains damage reduction 10/chaotic, which allows him to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a nonchaotic weapon. Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if he were a member of his previous creature type. Finally, the monk gains the ability to enter a state of perfect calm. During this time, the monk can take no actions, but he does regain ki at the rate of 1 point per 10 minutes spent at calm. He cannot use this ability to gain an amount of ki in excess of his maximum.</p>
			<h>Ex-Monks</h>
			<p>A monk who becomes nonlawful cannot gain new levels as a monk but retains all monk abilities.</p>

The number of points in a monk&#146;s ki pool is equal to 1/2 his monk level + his Wisdom modifier. As long as he has at least 1 point in his ki pool, he can make a ki strike. At 3rd level, ki strike allows his unarmed attacks to be treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 7th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 10th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 16th level, his unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
					<p>By spending 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action, a monk can make one additional unarmed strike at his highest attack bonus when making a flurry of blows attack. This bonus attack stacks with all bonus attacks gained from flurry of blows, as well as those from haste and similar effects. A monk gains additional powers that consume points from his ki pool as he gains levels.</p>
					<p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>

Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if he were a member of his previous creature type. Finally, the monk gains the ability to enter a state of perfect calm. During this time, the monk can take no actions, but he does regain ki at the rate of 1 point per 10 minutes spent at calm. He cannot use this ability to gain an amount of ki in excess of his maximum.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Whether studying at the feet of psychopomps or merely imitating the creatures' philosophy and methods, soul shepherds believe in safeguarding the Cycle of Souls.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Physical and mental perfection&#151;that is the life goal of every monk. For these skilled warriors, martial prowess and mental clarity are one and the same. Capable of pummeling foes with both f ist and weapon, monks are among the more versatile combatants on the battlef ield. Monks are also able to harness their ki, a spiritual life force that resides within, allowing them to perform amazing acts of acrobatics and mystical skill. All of this depends on incredible discipline and focus, and monks spend their entire lives perfecting these arts.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>Much of the monk has been reworked, including its base attack bonus, Hit Die, saves, and many of its special abilities. The result is a version of the monk that not only is easier to play, but also possesses a great deal more versatility. Flurry of blows is now much simpler to use in play. Many of the higher-level abilities of the monk, such as abundant step and quivering palm, have been incorporated into the new system of ki powers. As a monk advances in level, he can select from a variety of ki powers, allowing the player to truly customize his character.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any lawful.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p>S <b>tarting Wealth: </b>1d6 x 10 gp (average 35 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Monk (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Monks are proficient with the club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe, javelin, kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, short sword, shortspear, shuriken, siangham, sling, spear, and any weapon with the monk special weapon quality.</p>
			<p>Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields.</p>
			<p>When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses his AC bonus, as well as his fast movement and flurry of blows abilities.</p>
			<p><b>AC Bonus (Ex): </b>When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds his Wisdom bonus (if any) to his AC and CMD. In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC and CMD at 4th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every four monk levels thereafter, up to a maximum of +5 at 20th level.</p>
			<p>These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is flat-footed. He loses these bonuses when he is immobilized or helpless, when he wears any armor, when he carries a shield, or when he carries a medium or heavy load.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat: </b>At 1st level, 2nd level, and every 4 levels thereafter, a monk can select a bonus feat. These feats must be taken from the following list: Catch Off-Guard, Combat Reflexes, Deflect Arrows, Dodge, Improved Grapple, Scorpion Style, and Throw Anything. At 6th level, the following feats are added to the list: Gorgon&#146;s Fist, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Disarm, Improved Feint, Improved Trip, and Mobility. At 10th level, the following feats are added to the list: Improved Critical, Medusa&#146;s Wrath, Snatch Arrows, and Spring Attack. A monk need not have any of the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.</p>
			<p><b>Flurry of Blows (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a monk can make a flurry of blows as a full-attack action. When making a flurry of blows, the monk can make one additional attack at his highest base attack bonus. This additional attack stacks with the bonus attacks from haste and other similar effects. When using this ability, the monk can make these attacks with any combination of his unarmed strikes and weapons that have the monk special weapon quality. He takes no penalty for using multiple weapons when making a flurry of blows, but he does not gain any additional attacks beyond what&#146;s already granted by the flurry for doing so. (He can still gain additional attacks from a high base attack bonus, from this ability, and from haste and similar effects).</p>
			<p>At 11th level, a monk can make an additional attack at his highest base attack bonus whenever he makes a flurry of blows. This stacks with the first attack from this ability and additional attacks from haste and similar effects.</p>
			<p><b>Stunning Fist (Ex): </b>At 1st level, the monk gains Stunning Fist as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. At 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, the monk gains the ability to apply a new condition to the target of his Stunning Fist. This condition replaces stunning the target for 1 round, and a successful saving throw still negates the effect. At 4th level, the monk can choose to make the target fatigued. At 8th level, he can make the target sickened for 1 minute. At 12th level, he can make the target staggered for 1d6+1 rounds. At 16th level, he can permanently blind or deafen the target. At 20th level, he can paralyze the target for 1d6+1 rounds. The monk must choose which condition will apply before the attack roll is made. These effects do not stack with themselves (a creature fatigued by Stunning Fist cannot become exhausted if hit by Stunning Fist again), but additional hits do increase the duration.</p>
			<p><b>Unarmed Strike (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A monk&#146;s attacks can be with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk can make unarmed strikes with his hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk can apply his full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all his unarmed strikes. A monk&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, although he can choose to deal nonlethal damage with no penalty on his attack roll. He can make this choice while grappling as well.</p>
			<p>A monk&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
			<p>The damage dealt by a monk&#146;s unarmed strike is determined by the unarmed damage column on Table 1&#150;2: Monk. The damage listed is for Medium monks. The damage for Small or Large monks is listed below.</p>

			<p><b>Otherworldly Resilience (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a soul shepherd gains DR 2/adamantine, cold resistance 5, and electricity resistance 5. At 9th level, this improves to DR 5/adamantine, cold resistance 10, and electricity resistance 10.</p>
			<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a monk gains an enhancement bonus to his land speed, as shown on Table 1&#150;2. A monk in armor or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.</p>
			<p><b>Ki Pool (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a monk gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy he can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in a monk&#146;s ki pool is equal to 1/2 his monk level + his Wisdom modifier. As long as he has at least 1 point in his ki pool, he can make a ki strike. At 3rd level, ki strike allows his unarmed attacks to be treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 7th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 10th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 16th level, his unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
			<p>By spending 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action, a monk can make one additional unarmed strike at his highest attack bonus when making a flurry of blows attack. This bonus attack stacks with all bonus attacks gained from flurry of blows, as well as those from haste and similar effects. A monk gains additional powers that consume points from his ki pool as he gains levels.</p>
			<p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
			<p><b>Ki Powers (Su): </b>At 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a monk can select one ki power. These powers allow the monk to perform amazing feats of mystical power and acrobatic prowess by expending points from his ki pool. Once a ki power is selected, it cannot be changed. Some ki powers require the monk to be of a specific level or higher before they can be chosen. Unless otherwise noted, a monk cannot select an individual ki power more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Still Mind (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a monk gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against enchantment spells and effects.</p>
			<p><b>Purity of Body (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a monk gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.</p>
			<p><b>Style Strike (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a monk can learn one type of style strike. Whenever he makes a flurry of blows, he can designate one of his unarmed strikes as a style strike.

He must choose which style strike to apply before the attack roll is made. At 15th level, he can designate up to two of his unarmed strikes each round as a style strike, and each one can be a different type. The monk can choose from any of the following strikes.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Sense (Su): </b>At 12th level, a soul shepherd can spend 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action to grant himself the ability to notice, locate, and distinguish between living and undead creatures within 30 feet, just as if he had a psychopomp's spiritsense ability for a number of rounds equal to his Wisdom modifier (minimum 1).</p>
			<p><b>Tongue of the Sun and Moon (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a monk can understand and speak with any living creature, as if under a permanent tongues effect.</p>
			<p><b>Yamaraj's Judgment (Sp): </b>At 16th level, a soul shepherd can spend 1 point from his ki pool as a standard action to attempt to free an enslaved soul from an effect that is imprisoning it, such as soul bind or trap the soul. This functions as a targeted dispel magic spell with a caster level equal to the soul shepherd's level. He can spend an additional ki point when he activates this ability to gain a +4 bonus on the caster level check. If the soul is held prisoner by a creature or a non-spell effect, the soul shepherd frees it if his caster level check result is at least 11 + the creature or effect's CR.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex): </b>At 17th level, a monk no longer takes penalties to his ability scores for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any such penalties that he has already taken, however, remain in place. Age bonuses still accrue, and the monk still dies of old age when his time is up.</p>
			<p><b>Flawless Mind: </b>At 19th level, a monk gains total control over his mental faculties. Whenever he attempts a Will save, he can roll twice and take the better result. If he fails a Will saving throw against a spell or effect that has a duration longer than 1 hour, the monk can attempt a new saving throw at the end of each hour to end the effect.</p>
			<p><b>Perfect Self: </b>At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical creature. He is forevermore treated as an outsider rather than a humanoid (or whatever his original creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects. Additionally, the monk gains damage reduction 10/chaotic, which allows him to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a nonchaotic weapon. Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if he were a member of his previous creature type. Finally, the monk gains the ability to enter a state of perfect calm. During this time, the monk can take no actions, but he does regain ki at the rate of 1 point per 10 minutes spent at calm. He cannot use this ability to gain an amount of ki in excess of his maximum.</p>

			<p><i>A serpent-fire adept embraces the secrets of her chakras and mastery of their energetic flow.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Physical and mental perfection&#151;that is the life goal of every monk. For these skilled warriors, martial prowess and mental clarity are one and the same. Capable of pummeling foes with both f ist and weapon, monks are among the more versatile combatants on the battlef ield. Monks are also able to harness their ki, a spiritual life force that resides within, allowing them to perform amazing acts of acrobatics and mystical skill. All of this depends on incredible discipline and focus, and monks spend their entire lives perfecting these arts.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>Much of the monk has been reworked, including its base attack bonus, Hit Die, saves, and many of its special abilities. The result is a version of the monk that not only is easier to play, but also possesses a great deal more versatility. Flurry of blows is now much simpler to use in play. Many of the higher-level abilities of the monk, such as abundant step and quivering palm, have been incorporated into the new system of ki powers. As a monk advances in level, he can select from a variety of ki powers, allowing the player to truly customize his character.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any lawful.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Monks are proficient with the club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe, javelin, kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, short sword, shortspear, shuriken, siangham, sling, spear, and any weapon with the monk special weapon quality.</p>
			<p>Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields.</p>
			<p>When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses his AC bonus, as well as his fast movement and flurry of blows abilities.</p>
			<p><b>AC Bonus (Ex): </b>When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds his Wisdom bonus (if any) to his AC and CMD. In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC and CMD at 4th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every four monk levels thereafter, up to a maximum of +5 at 20th level.</p>
			<p>These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is flat-footed. He loses these bonuses when he is immobilized or helpless, when he wears any armor, when he carries a shield, or when he carries a medium or heavy load.</p>
			<p><b>Chakra Training: </b>A serpent-fire adept gains Chakra Initiate and Psychic Sensitivity as bonus feats. She need not meet these feats&#146; prerequisites, and can use her serpent-fire ki from Chakra Initiate to open and maintain her root chakra, despite not being 2nd level. This ability replaces stunning fist and the bonus feat gained at 1st level.</p>
			<p><b>Flurry of Blows (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a monk can make a flurry of blows as a full-attack action. When making a flurry of blows, the monk can make one additional attack at his highest base attack bonus. This additional attack stacks with the bonus attacks from haste and other similar effects. When using this ability, the monk can make these attacks with any combination of his unarmed strikes and weapons that have the monk special weapon quality. He takes no penalty for using multiple weapons when making a flurry of blows, but he does not gain any additional attacks beyond what&#146;s already granted by the flurry for doing so. (He can still gain additional attacks from a high base attack bonus, from this ability, and from haste and similar effects).</p>
			<p>At 11th level, a monk can make an additional attack at his highest base attack bonus whenever he makes a flurry of blows. This stacks with the first attack from this ability and additional attacks from haste and similar effects.</p>
			<p><b>Unarmed Strike (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A monk&#146;s attacks can be with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk can make unarmed strikes with his hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk can apply his full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all his unarmed strikes. A monk&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, although he can choose to deal nonlethal damage with no penalty on his attack roll. He can make this choice while grappling as well.</p>
			<p>A monk&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
			<p>The damage dealt by a monk&#146;s unarmed strike is determined by the unarmed damage column on Table 1&#150;2: Monk. The damage listed is for Medium monks. The damage for Small or Large monks is listed below.</p>

			<p><b>Chakra Expertise (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, the serpent-fire adept gains a bonus equal to 1/2 her monk level on Fortitude and Will saves attempted to maintain awakened chakras. At 8th level, when she has opened one or more chakras, she can maintain those chakras (without opening any new chakras) for 1 round without taking a swift action, expending ki, or attempting Fortitude or Will saves to maintain the chakras. This increases to 2 rounds at 16th level. After maintaining her chakras with chakra expertise, the monk must open a new chakra or maintain her open chakras normally before she can use chakra expertise again. This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a monk can avoid damage from many area-effect attacks. If a monk succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a monk gains an enhancement bonus to his land speed, as shown on Table 1&#150;2. A monk in armor or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.</p>
			<p><b>Ki Pool (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a monk gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy he can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in a monk&#146;s ki pool is equal to 1/2 his monk level + his Wisdom modifier. As long as he has at least 1 point in his ki pool, he can make a ki strike. At 3rd level, ki strike allows his unarmed attacks to be treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 7th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 10th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 16th level, his unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
			<p>By spending 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action, a monk can make one additional unarmed strike at his highest attack bonus when making a flurry of blows attack. This bonus attack stacks with all bonus attacks gained from flurry of blows, as well as those from haste and similar effects. A monk gains additional powers that consume points from his ki pool as he gains levels.</p>
			<p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
			<p><b>Ki Powers (Su): </b>At 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a monk can select one ki power. These powers allow the monk to perform amazing feats of mystical power and acrobatic prowess by expending points from his ki pool. Once a ki power is selected, it cannot be changed. Some ki powers require the monk to be of a specific level or higher before they can be chosen. Unless otherwise noted, a monk cannot select an individual ki power more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Light Spirit (Su): </b>At 4th level when the serpent-fire adept has her sacral chakra open and chooses to benefit from its power, her fly speed is equal to either her base land speed or her bonus to her base speed from the monk fast movement class ability (whichever is higher). She maintains this fly speed for a number of rounds equal to her Wisdom bonus (minimum 1 round), even if she closes her chakras. This ability replaces the 4th-level ki power.</p>
			<p><b>Still Mind (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a monk gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against enchantment spells and effects.</p>
			<p><b>Purity of Body (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a monk gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.</p>
			<p><b>Style Strike (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a monk can learn one type of style strike. Whenever he makes a flurry of blows, he can designate one of his unarmed strikes as a style strike. This attack is resolved as normal, but it has an additional effect depending on the type of strike chosen. At 9th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, a monk learns an additional style strike. He must choose which style strike to apply before the attack roll is made. At 15th level, he can designate up to two of his unarmed strikes each round as a style strike, and each one can be a different type. The monk can choose from any of the following strikes.</p>
			<p><b>Chakra Adept (Ex): </b>At 6th level, the serpent-fire adept gains Chakra Adept as a bonus feat. She need not meet the feat&#146;s prerequisites. When the serpent-fire adept has used all her rounds of chakra expertise to maintain open chakras, if she does not spend additional ki to maintain her open chakras on the next round, her highest chakra closes and she can spend a swift action to use any one of the abilities of her remaining open chakras. On the round after that, all her chakras close, and if she wishes to reopen them, she must start again with her root chakra. This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 6th level.</p>
			<p><b>Linked Chakras (Ex): </b>At 8th level, the serpent-fire adept can open multiple chakras at once as a standard action. The round that she does this, she is required to make saving throws only to resist being overwhelmed by the highest chakra she opens, though the save DCs are increased by 5. She can do this once per day, plus one additional time per day each at 12th and 17th level. This ability replaces the 8th-level ki power.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a monk&#146;s evasion ability improves. He still takes no damage on successful Reflex saving throws against attacks, but henceforth he takes only half damage on failed saves. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Chakra Mastery (Ex): </b>At 10th level, the serpent-fire adept gains Chakra Master as a bonus feat. She need not meet the feat&#146;s prerequisites. When maintaining her open chakras with chakra expertise, she can spend 1 point of ki to gain the benefits of two chakras rather than one in that round (or three chakras, if she has opened her crown chakra). At 14th level, the serpent-fire adept&#146;s pool of serpent-fire ki increases to 7 points, and at 18th level, it increases to 9 points. This ability replaces the bonus feats gained at 10th, 14th, and 18th level.</p>
			<p><b>Tongue of the Sun and Moon (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a monk can understand and speak with any living creature, as if under a permanent tongues effect.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex): </b>At 17th level, a monk no longer takes penalties to his ability scores for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any such penalties that he has already taken, however, remain in place. Age bonuses still accrue, and the monk still dies of old age when his time is up.</p>
			<p><b>Flawless Mind: </b>At 19th level, a monk gains total control over his mental faculties. Whenever he attempts a Will save, he can roll twice and take the better result. If he fails a Will saving throw against a spell or effect that has a duration longer than 1 hour, the monk can attempt a new saving throw at the end of each hour to end the effect.</p>
			<p><b>Perfect Self: </b>At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical creature. He is forevermore treated as an outsider rather than a humanoid (or whatever his original creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects. Additionally, the monk gains damage reduction 10/chaotic, which allows him to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a nonchaotic weapon. Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if he were a member of his previous creature type. Finally, the monk gains the ability to enter a state of perfect calm. During this time, the monk can take no actions, but he does regain ki at the rate of 1 point per 10 minutes spent at calm. He cannot use this ability to gain an amount of ki in excess of his maximum.</p>
			<h>Ex-Monks</h>
			<p>A monk who becomes nonlawful cannot gain new levels as a monk but retains all monk abilities.</p>

					<p>At 1st level, a monk can make a flurry of blows as a full-attack action. When making a flurry of blows, the monk can make one additional attack at his highest base attack bonus. This additional attack stacks with the bonus attacks from haste and other similar effects. When using this ability, the monk can make these attacks with any combination of his unarmed strikes and weapons that have the monk special weapon quality. He takes no penalty for using multiple weapons when making a flurry of blows, but he does not gain any additional attacks beyond what&#146;s already granted by the flurry for doing so. (He can still gain additional attacks from a high base attack bonus, from this ability, and from haste and similar effects).</p>
					<p>At 11th level, a monk can make an additional attack at his highest base attack bonus whenever he makes a flurry of blows. This stacks with the first attack from this ability and additional attacks from haste and similar effects.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, the monk gains Stunning Fist as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. At 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, the monk gains the ability to apply a new condition to the target of his Stunning Fist. This condition replaces stunning the target for 1 round, and a successful saving throw still negates the effect. At 4th level, the monk can choose to make the target fatigued. At 8th level, he can make the target sickened for 1 minute. At 12th level, he can make the target staggered for 1d6+1 rounds. At 16th level, he can permanently blind or deafen the target. At 20th level, he can paralyze the target for 1d6+1 rounds. The monk must choose which condition will apply before the attack roll is made. These effects do not stack with themselves (a creature fatigued by Stunning Fist cannot become exhausted if hit by Stunning Fist again), but additional hits do increase the duration.</p>

				<name type="string">Unarmed Strike</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A monk&#146;s attacks can be with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk can make unarmed strikes with his hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk can apply his full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all his unarmed strikes. A monk&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, although he can choose to deal nonlethal damage with no penalty on his attack roll. He can make this choice while grappling as well.</p>
					<p>A monk&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
					<p>The damage dealt by a monk&#146;s unarmed strike is determined by the unarmed damage column on Table 1&#150;2: Monk. The damage listed is for Medium monks. The damage for Small or Large monks is listed below.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level, a monk gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy he can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in a monk&#146;s ki pool is equal to 1/2 his monk level + his Wisdom modifier. As long as he has at least 1 point in his ki pool, he can make a ki strike. At 3rd level, ki strike allows his unarmed attacks to be treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 7th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 10th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 16th level, his unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
					<p>By spending 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action, a monk can make one additional unarmed strike at his highest attack bonus when making a flurry of blows attack. This bonus attack stacks with all bonus attacks gained from flurry of blows, as well as those from haste and similar effects. A monk gains additional powers that consume points from his ki pool as he gains levels.</p>
					<p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>

Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if he were a member of his previous creature type. Finally, the monk gains the ability to enter a state of perfect calm. During this time, the monk can take no actions, but he does regain ki at the rate of 1 point per 10 minutes spent at calm.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The practices of softstrike monks date back to the peaceful eras of Imperial Lung Wa. Still common among warriors today, softstrike monks employ a nonlethal but effective form of combat.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Physical and mental perfection&#151;that is the life goal of every monk. For these skilled warriors, martial prowess and mental clarity are one and the same. Capable of pummeling foes with both f ist and weapon, monks are among the more versatile combatants on the battlef ield. Monks are also able to harness their ki, a spiritual life force that resides within, allowing them to perform amazing acts of acrobatics and mystical skill. All of this depends on incredible discipline and focus, and monks spend their entire lives perfecting these arts.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>Much of the monk has been reworked, including its base attack bonus, Hit Die, saves, and many of its special abilities. The result is a version of the monk that not only is easier to play, but also possesses a great deal more versatility. Flurry of blows is now much simpler to use in play. Many of the higher-level abilities of the monk, such as abundant step and quivering palm, have been incorporated into the new system of ki powers. As a monk advances in level, he can select from a variety of ki powers, allowing the player to truly customize his character.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any lawful.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p>S <b>tarting Wealth: </b>1d6 x 10 gp (average 35 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Monk (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A softstrike monk is proficient with the aklys, bolas, club, light flail, light mace, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sap, sling, and any weapon with the monk special quality that can deal bludgeoning damage. He is considered proficient only with monk weapons that can deal multiple types of damage when dealing bludgeoning damage.</p>
			<p>Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields.</p>
			<p>When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses his AC bonus, as well as his fast movement and flurry of blows abilities.</p>
			<p><b>AC Bonus (Ex): </b>When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds his Wisdom bonus (if any) to his AC and CMD. In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC and CMD at 4th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every four monk levels thereafter, up to a maximum of +5 at 20th level.</p>
			<p>These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is flat-footed. He loses these bonuses when he is immobilized or helpless, when he wears any armor, when he carries a shield, or when he carries a medium or heavy load.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat: </b>At 1st level, 2nd level, and every 4 levels thereafter, a monk can select a bonus feat. These feats must be taken from the following list: Catch Off-Guard, Combat Reflexes, Deflect Arrows, Dodge, Improved Grapple, Scorpion Style, and Throw Anything. At 6th level, the following feats are added to the list: Gorgon&#146;s Fist, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Disarm, Improved Feint, Improved Trip, and Mobility. At 10th level, the following feats are added to the list: Improved Critical, Medusa&#146;s Wrath, Snatch Arrows, and Spring Attack. A monk need not have any of the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.</p>
			<p><b>Feather Touch (Ex): </b>A softstrike monk does not take the normal &#150;4 penalty on attack rolls for using a lethal weapon to deal nonlethal damage. In addition, he can use his stunning fist ability while making a nonlethal attack with a weapon.</p>
			<p><b>Flurry of Blows (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a monk can make a flurry of blows as a full-attack action. When making a flurry of blows, the monk can make one additional attack at his highest base attack bonus. This additional attack stacks with the bonus attacks from haste and other similar effects. When using this ability, the monk can make these attacks with any combination of his unarmed strikes and weapons that have the monk special weapon quality. He takes no penalty for using multiple weapons when making a flurry of blows, but he does not gain any additional attacks beyond what&#146;s already granted by the flurry for doing so. (He can still gain additional attacks from a high base attack bonus, from this ability, and from haste and similar effects).</p>
			<p>At 11th level, a monk can make an additional attack at his highest base attack bonus whenever he makes a flurry of blows. This stacks with the first attack from this ability and additional attacks from haste and similar effects.</p>
			<p><b>Nonlethal Strikes (Ex): </b>A softstrike monk focuses on blows that do not inflict deadly harm. When a softstrike monk deals nonlethal damage with his unarmed strikes, his monk level is treated as 4 levels higher for the purposes of determining the damage he deals (to a maximum of 4d8 at 20th level for a Medium monk). When dealing lethal damage with his unarmed strikes, his monk level is treated as if it were 4 levels lower (minimum 1st level) for the purpose of determining damage.</p>
			<p><b>Stunning Fist (Ex): </b>At 1st level, the monk gains Stunning Fist as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. At 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, the monk gains the ability to apply a new condition to the target of his Stunning Fist. This condition replaces stunning the target for 1 round, and a successful saving throw still negates the effect. At 4th level, the monk can choose to make the target fatigued. At 8th level, he can make the target sickened for 1 minute. At 12th level, he can make the target staggered for 1d6+1 rounds. At 16th level, he can permanently blind or deafen the target. At 20th level, he can paralyze the target for 1d6+1 rounds. The monk must choose which condition will apply before the attack roll is made. These effects do not stack with themselves (a creature fatigued by Stunning Fist cannot become exhausted if hit by Stunning Fist again), but additional hits do increase the duration.</p>
			<p><b>Tenet of Life (Su): </b>Though a softstrike monk accepts that death may happen in combat, he cannot abide killing in cold blood. If he slays an unconscious or helpless living foe, or merely stands by and allows such a killing to occur, he becomes shaken for 1 hour. In addition, the act disrupts the softstrike monk&#146;s ki; if he has a ki pool, he loses a number of ki points equal to half his level, as if they had been spent.</p>
			<p><b>Unarmed Strike (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A monk&#146;s attacks can be with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk can make unarmed strikes with his hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk can apply his full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all his unarmed strikes. A monk&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, although he can choose to deal nonlethal damage with no penalty on his attack roll. He can make this choice while grappling as well.</p>
			<p>A monk&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
			<p>The damage dealt by a monk&#146;s unarmed strike is determined by the unarmed damage column on Table 1&#150;2: Monk. The damage listed is for Medium monks. The damage for Small or Large monks is listed below.</p>

			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a monk can avoid damage from many area-effect attacks. If a monk succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a monk gains an enhancement bonus to his land speed, as shown on Table 1&#150;2. A monk in armor or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.</p>
			<p><b>Ki Pool (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a monk gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy he can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in a monk&#146;s ki pool is equal to 1/2 his monk level + his Wisdom modifier. As long as he has at least 1 point in his ki pool, he can make a ki strike. At 3rd level, ki strike allows his unarmed attacks to be treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 7th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 10th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 16th level, his unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
			<p>By spending 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action, a monk can make one additional unarmed strike at his highest attack bonus when making a flurry of blows attack. This bonus attack stacks with all bonus attacks gained from flurry of blows, as well as those from haste and similar effects. A monk gains additional powers that consume points from his ki pool as he gains levels.</p>
			<p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
			<p><b>Ki Powers (Su): </b>At 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a monk can select one ki power. These powers allow the monk to perform amazing feats of mystical power and acrobatic prowess by expending points from his ki pool. Once a ki power is selected, it cannot be changed. Some ki powers require the monk to be of a specific level or higher before they can be chosen. Unless otherwise noted, a monk cannot select an individual ki power more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Still Mind (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a monk gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against enchantment spells and effects.</p>
			<p><b>Purity of Body (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a monk gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.</p>
			<p><b>Style Strike (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a monk can learn one type of style strike. Whenever he makes a flurry of blows, he can designate one of his unarmed strikes as a style strike. This attack is resolved as normal, but it has an additional effect depending on the type of strike chosen. At 9th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, a monk learns an additional style strike. He must choose which style strike to apply before the attack roll is made. At 15th level, he can designate up to two of his unarmed strikes each round as a style strike, and each one can be a different type. The monk can choose from any of the following strikes.</p>
			<p><b>Life-Giving Blows (Su): </b>At 6th level, a softstrike monk can force a piece of his life force into a nonliving creature to disrupt its animating essence. If he hits an undead foe with an unarmed attack, he can spend 1 ki point as a free action to remove the target&#146;s immunity to nonlethal damage for a number of minutes equal to his Wisdom modifier. If, during this time, the target&#146;s nonlethal damage exceeds its current hit points, it is destroyed. At 10th level, a softstrike monk can also use this ability against constructs.</p>
			<p><b>Wholeness of Body and Spirit (Su): </b>At 7th level, a softstrike monk can use wholeness of body on both himself and other creatures, though it heals only nonlethal damage. If he uses this ability on an unconscious foe, he can spend 1 additional ki point to force the creature to accept a pact of life. The creature must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half the softstrike monk&#146;s level + his Wisdom modifier) or the pact renders it unable to directly attack the monk and any allies within 60 feet, as per sanctuary, for a number of days equal to the softstrike monk&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a monk&#146;s evasion ability improves. He still takes no damage on successful Reflex saving throws against attacks, but henceforth he takes only half damage on failed saves. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Tongue of the Sun and Moon (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a monk can understand and speak with any living creature, as if under a permanent tongues effect.</p>
			<p><b>Incapacitating Palm (Su): </b>At 15th level, a softstrike monk renders the target of his quivering palm unconscious instead of killing the creature. Upon failing its Fortitude saving throw, the target is knocked unconscious for a number of minutes equal to the softstrike monk&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex): </b>At 17th level, a monk no longer takes penalties to his ability scores for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any such penalties that he has already taken, however, remain in place. Age bonuses still accrue, and the monk still dies of old age when his time is up.</p>
			<p><b>Flawless Mind: </b>At 19th level, a monk gains total control over his mental faculties. Whenever he attempts a Will save, he can roll twice and take the better result. If he fails a Will saving throw against a spell or effect that has a duration longer than 1 hour, the monk can attempt a new saving throw at the end of each hour to end the effect.</p>
			<p><b>Resilient Body (Su): </b>At 19th level, a softstrike monk&#146;s mastery of nonlethal combat lets him apply his techniques to his defense. A softstrike monk converts any precision damage he takes to nonlethal damage.</p>
			<p><b>Perfect Self: </b>At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical creature. He is forevermore treated as an outsider rather than a humanoid (or whatever his original creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects. Additionally, the monk gains damage reduction 10/chaotic, which allows him to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a nonchaotic weapon. Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if he were a member of his previous creature type. Finally, the monk gains the ability to enter a state of perfect calm. During this time, the monk can take no actions, but he does regain ki at the rate of 1 point per 10 minutes spent at calm. He cannot use this ability to gain an amount of ki in excess of his maximum.</p>
			<h>Ex-Monks</h>
			<p>A monk who becomes nonlawful cannot gain new levels as a monk but retains all monk abilities.</p>

At 20th level, he can paralyze the target for 1d6+1 rounds. The monk must choose which condition will apply before the attack roll is made. These effects do not stack with themselves (a creature fatigued by Stunning Fist cannot become exhausted if hit by Stunning Fist again), but additional hits do increase the duration.</p>

				<name type="string">Unarmed Strike</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A monk&#146;s attacks can be with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk can make unarmed strikes with his hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk can apply his full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all his unarmed strikes. A monk&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, although he can choose to deal nonlethal damage with no penalty on his attack roll. He can make this choice while grappling as well.</p>
					<p>A monk&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
					<p>The damage dealt by a monk&#146;s unarmed strike is determined by the unarmed damage column on Table 1&#150;2: Monk. The damage listed is for Medium monks. The damage for Small or Large monks is listed below.</p>

If a monk succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 3rd level, a monk gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy he can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in a monk&#146;s ki pool is equal to 1/2 his monk level + his Wisdom modifier. As long as he has at least 1 point in his ki pool, he can make a ki strike. At 3rd level, ki strike allows his unarmed attacks to be treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 7th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 10th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 16th level, his unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
					<p>By spending 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action, a monk can make one additional unarmed strike at his highest attack bonus when making a flurry of blows attack. This bonus attack stacks with all bonus attacks gained from flurry of blows, as well as those from haste and similar effects. A monk gains additional powers that consume points from his ki pool as he gains levels.</p>
					<p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Steeped in traditions that trace their origins to the warrior-monks who trained under the tutelage of draconic masters in Tian Xia, scaled fists eschew passive introspection in favor of unshakable confidence. Scaled fists learn to combine brutal intimidation with the brazen ferocity of an ancient wyrm to devastate their foes.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Physical and mental perfection&#151;that is the life goal of every monk. For these skilled warriors, martial prowess and mental clarity are one and the same. Capable of pummeling foes with both f ist and weapon, monks are among the more versatile combatants on the battlef ield. Monks are also able to harness their ki, a spiritual life force that resides within, allowing them to perform amazing acts of acrobatics and mystical skill. All of this depends on incredible discipline and focus, and monks spend their entire lives perfecting these arts.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>Much of the monk has been reworked, including its base attack bonus, Hit Die, saves, and many of its special abilities. The result is a version of the monk that not only is easier to play, but also possesses a great deal more versatility. Flurry of blows is now much simpler to use in play. Many of the higher-level abilities of the monk, such as abundant step and quivering palm, have been incorporated into the new system of ki powers. As a monk advances in level, he can select from a variety of ki powers, allowing the player to truly customize his character.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any lawful.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p>S <b>tarting Wealth: </b>1d6 x 10 gp (average 35 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Monk (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Monks are proficient with the club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe, javelin, kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, short sword, shortspear, shuriken, siangham, sling, spear, and any weapon with the monk special weapon quality.</p>
			<p>Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields.</p>
			<p>When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses his AC bonus, as well as his fast movement and flurry of blows abilities.</p>
			<p><b>AC Bonus (Ex): </b>When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds his Wisdom bonus (if any) to his AC and CMD. In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC and CMD at 4th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every four monk levels thereafter, up to a maximum of +5 at 20th level.</p>
			<p>These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is flat-footed. He loses these bonuses when he is immobilized or helpless, when he wears any armor, when he carries a shield, or when he carries a medium or heavy load.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat: </b>At 1st level, 2nd level, and every 4 levels thereafter, a monk can select a bonus feat. These feats must be taken from the following list: Catch Off-Guard, Combat Reflexes, Deflect Arrows, Dodge, Improved Grapple, Scorpion Style, and Throw Anything. At 6th level, the following feats are added to the list: Gorgon&#146;s Fist, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Disarm, Improved Feint, Improved Trip, and Mobility. At 10th level, the following feats are added to the list: Improved Critical, Medusa&#146;s Wrath, Snatch Arrows, and Spring Attack. A monk need not have any of the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.</p>
			<p>A scaled fist adds Dragon Style and Intimidating Prowess to her list of bonus feats at 1st level. At 6th level, she adds Dazzling Display and Dragon Ferocity. At 10th level, she adds Disheartening Display, Dragon Roar and Shatter Defenses.</p>
			<p><b>Draconic Might : </b>Any of the scaled fist&#146;s class abilities that make calculations based on her Wisdom (including bonus feats with DCs or uses per day, such as Stunning Fist, but not Wisdom-based skills or Will saving throws) are instead based on her Charisma.</p>
			<p><b>Flurry of Blows (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a monk can make a flurry of blows as a full-attack action. When making a flurry of blows, the monk can make one additional attack at his highest base attack bonus. This additional attack stacks with the bonus attacks from haste and other similar effects. When using this ability, the monk can make these attacks with any combination of his unarmed strikes and weapons that have the monk special weapon quality. He takes no penalty for using multiple weapons when making a flurry of blows, but he does not gain any additional attacks beyond what&#146;s already granted by the flurry for doing so. (He can still gain additional attacks from a high base attack bonus, from this ability, and from haste and similar effects).</p>
			<p>At 11th level, a monk can make an additional attack at his highest base attack bonus whenever he makes a flurry of blows. This stacks with the first attack from this ability and additional attacks from haste and similar effects.</p>
			<p><b>Stunning Fist (Ex): </b>At 1st level, the monk gains Stunning Fist as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. At 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, the monk gains the ability to apply a new condition to the target of his Stunning Fist. This condition replaces stunning the target for 1 round, and a successful saving throw still negates the effect. At 4th level, the monk can choose to make the target fatigued. At 8th level, he can make the target sickened for 1 minute. At 12th level, he can make the target staggered for 1d6+1 rounds. At 16th level, he can permanently blind or deafen the target. At 20th level, he can paralyze the target for 1d6+1 rounds. The monk must choose which condition will apply before the attack roll is made. These effects do not stack with themselves (a creature fatigued by Stunning Fist cannot become exhausted if hit by Stunning Fist again), but additional hits do increase the duration.</p>
			<p><b>Unarmed Strike (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A monk&#146;s attacks can be with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk can make unarmed strikes with his hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk can apply his full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all his unarmed strikes. A monk&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, although he can choose to deal nonlethal damage with no penalty on his attack roll. He can make this choice while grappling as well.</p>
			<p>A monk&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
			<p>The damage dealt by a monk&#146;s unarmed strike is determined by the unarmed damage column on Table 1&#150;2: Monk. The damage listed is for Medium monks. The damage for Small or Large monks is listed below.</p>

			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a monk can avoid damage from many area-effect attacks. If a monk succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a monk gains an enhancement bonus to his land speed, as shown on Table 1&#150;2. A monk in armor or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.</p>
			<p><b>Draconic Fury (Su): </b>At 3rd level, the scaled fist has gains the elemental fury ki power.</p>
			<p><b>Ki Pool (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a monk gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy he can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in a monk&#146;s ki pool is equal to 1/2 his monk level + his Wisdom modifier. As long as he has at least 1 point in his ki pool, he can make a ki strike. At 3rd level, ki strike allows his unarmed attacks to be treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 7th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 10th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 16th level, his unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
			<p>By spending 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action, a monk can make one additional unarmed strike at his highest attack bonus when making a flurry of blows attack. This bonus attack stacks with all bonus attacks gained from flurry of blows, as well as those from haste and similar effects. A monk gains additional powers that consume points from his ki pool as he gains levels.</p>
			<p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
			<p><b>Ki Powers (Su): </b>At 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a monk can select one ki power. These powers allow the monk to perform amazing feats of mystical power and acrobatic prowess by expending points from his ki pool. Once a ki power is selected, it cannot be changed. Some ki powers require the monk to be of a specific level or higher before they can be chosen. Unless otherwise noted, a monk cannot select an individual ki power more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Draconic Mettle (Su): </b>At 4th level, a scaled fist gains a +2 bonus on saving throws attempted against all fear, paralysis, and sleep effects.</p>
			<p><b>Purity of Body (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a monk gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.</p>
			<p><b>Style Strike (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a monk can learn one type of style strike. Whenever he makes a flurry of blows, he can designate one of his unarmed strikes as a style strike. This attack is resolved as normal, but it has an additional effect depending on the type of strike chosen. At 9th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, a monk learns an additional style strike. He must choose which style strike to apply before the attack roll is made. At 15th level, he can designate up to two of his unarmed strikes each round as a style strike, and each one can be a different type. The monk can choose from any of the following strikes.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a monk&#146;s evasion ability improves. He still takes no damage on successful Reflex saving throws against attacks, but henceforth he takes only half damage on failed saves. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Draconic Breath (Su): </b>At 12th level, a scaled fist can spend 3 points from her ki pool to make a breath weapon attack as a standard action. This breath weapon deals 1d6 points of damage of her energy type per monk level in a 30-foot cone. Those caught in the area of the breath can attempt a Reflex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the scaled fist&#146;s monk level + her Charisma modifier) to halve the normal damage.</p>
			<p><b>Tongue of the Sun and Moon (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a monk can understand and speak with any living creature, as if under a permanent tongues effect.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex): </b>At 17th level, a monk no longer takes penalties to his ability scores for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any such penalties that he has already taken, however, remain in place. Age bonuses still accrue, and the monk still dies of old age when his time is up.</p>
			<p><b>Flawless Mind: </b>At 19th level, a monk gains total control over his mental faculties. Whenever he attempts a Will save, he can roll twice and take the better result. If he fails a Will saving throw against a spell or effect that has a duration longer than 1 hour, the monk can attempt a new saving throw at the end of each hour to end the effect.</p>
			<p><b>Perfect Self: </b>At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical creature. He is forevermore treated as an outsider rather than a humanoid (or whatever his original creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects. Additionally, the monk gains damage reduction 10/chaotic, which allows him to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a nonchaotic weapon. Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if he were a member of his previous creature type. Finally, the monk gains the ability to enter a state of perfect calm. During this time, the monk can take no actions, but he does regain ki at the rate of 1 point per 10 minutes spent at calm. He cannot use this ability to gain an amount of ki in excess of his maximum.</p>
			<h>Ex-Monks</h>
			<p>A monk who becomes nonlawful cannot gain new levels as a monk but retains all monk abilities.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Sage counselors are ascetics and mystics who leave the confines of the monastery walls to advise secular people about spiritual truths and to seek knowledge of the outside world. They often find work as mentors teaching religion and martial arts, and some of them even become counselors for people in high places. Sage counselors often speak in metaphors, knowing that indirect persuasion is more effective than speaking plainly, and they use indirect tactics in combat as well.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Physical and mental perfection&#151;that is the life goal of every monk. For these skilled warriors, martial prowess and mental clarity are one and the same. Capable of pummeling foes with both f ist and weapon, monks are among the more versatile combatants on the battlef ield. Monks are also able to harness their ki, a spiritual life force that resides within, allowing them to perform amazing acts of acrobatics and mystical skill. All of this depends on incredible discipline and focus, and monks spend their entire lives perfecting these arts.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>Much of the monk has been reworked, including its base attack bonus, Hit Die, saves, and many of its special abilities. The result is a version of the monk that not only is easier to play, but also possesses a great deal more versatility. Flurry of blows is now much simpler to use in play. Many of the higher-level abilities of the monk, such as abundant step and quivering palm, have been incorporated into the new system of ki powers. As a monk advances in level, he can select from a variety of ki powers, allowing the player to truly customize his character.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any lawful.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p>S <b>tarting Wealth: </b>1d6 x 10 gp (average 35 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Monk (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Dex), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Monks are proficient with the club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe, javelin, kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, short sword, shortspear, shuriken, siangham, sling, spear, and any weapon with the monk special weapon quality.</p>
			<p>Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields.</p>
			<p>When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses his AC bonus, as well as his fast movement and flurry of blows abilities.</p>
			<p><b>AC Bonus (Ex): </b>When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds his Wisdom bonus (if any) to his AC and CMD. In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC and CMD at 4th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every four monk levels thereafter, up to a maximum of +5 at 20th level.</p>
			<p>These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is flat-footed. He loses these bonuses when he is immobilized or helpless, when he wears any armor, when he carries a shield, or when he carries a medium or heavy load.</p>
			<p><b>Cunning Fist (Ex): </b>A sage counselor gains Combat Expertise as a bonus feat, even if he doesn&#146;t meet the prerequisites, and he can ignore the Intelligence prerequisite on feats that have Combat Expertise as a prerequisite. At 2nd level, he gains Improved Feint, and at 6th level, he gains Greater Feint, even if he doesn&#146;t meet the prerequisites.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the bonus feats gained at 1st, 2nd, and 6th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Flurry of Blows (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a monk can make a flurry of blows as a full-attack action. When making a flurry of blows, the monk can make one additional attack at his highest base attack bonus. This additional attack stacks with the bonus attacks from haste and other similar effects. When using this ability, the monk can make these attacks with any combination of his unarmed strikes and weapons that have the monk special weapon quality. He takes no penalty for using multiple weapons when making a flurry of blows, but he does not gain any additional attacks beyond what&#146;s already granted by the flurry for doing so. (He can still gain additional attacks from a high base attack bonus, from this ability, and from haste and similar effects).</p>
			<p>At 11th level, a monk can make an additional attack at his highest base attack bonus whenever he makes a flurry of blows. This stacks with the first attack from this ability and additional attacks from haste and similar effects.</p>
			<p><b>Stunning Fist (Ex): </b>At 1st level, the monk gains Stunning Fist as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. At 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, the monk gains the ability to apply a new condition to the target of his Stunning Fist. This condition replaces stunning the target for 1 round, and a successful saving throw still negates the effect. At 4th level, the monk can choose to make the target fatigued. At 8th level, he can make the target sickened for 1 minute. At 12th level, he can make the target staggered for 1d6+1 rounds. At 16th level, he can permanently blind or deafen the target. At 20th level, he can paralyze the target for 1d6+1 rounds. The monk must choose which condition will apply before the attack roll is made. These effects do not stack with themselves (a creature fatigued by Stunning Fist cannot become exhausted if hit by Stunning Fist again), but additional hits do increase the duration.</p>
			<p><b>Unarmed Strike (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A monk&#146;s attacks can be with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk can make unarmed strikes with his hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk can apply his full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all his unarmed strikes. A monk&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, although he can choose to deal nonlethal damage with no penalty on his attack roll. He can make this choice while grappling as well.</p>
			<p>A monk&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
			<p>The damage dealt by a monk&#146;s unarmed strike is determined by the unarmed damage column on Table 1&#150;2: Monk. The damage listed is for Medium monks. The damage for Small or Large monks is listed below.</p>

			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a monk can avoid damage from many area-effect attacks. If a monk succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a monk gains an enhancement bonus to his land speed, as shown on Table 1&#150;2. A monk in armor or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.</p>
			<p><b>Ki Pool (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a monk gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy he can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in a monk&#146;s ki pool is equal to 1/2 his monk level + his Wisdom modifier. As long as he has at least 1 point in his ki pool, he can make a ki strike. At 3rd level, ki strike allows his unarmed attacks to be treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 7th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 10th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 16th level, his unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
			<p>By spending 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action, a monk can make one additional unarmed strike at his highest attack bonus when making a flurry of blows attack. This bonus attack stacks with all bonus attacks gained from flurry of blows, as well as those from haste and similar effects. A monk gains additional powers that consume points from his ki pool as he gains levels.</p>
			<p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
			<p><b>Deceptive Ki (Su): </b>At 4th level, the sage counselor can spend 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action to give himself a +4 insight bonus on his next Bluff check. The sage counselor does not gain the ability to spend ki to increase his speed by 20 feet for 1 round.</p>
			<p>This ability alters ki pool and replaces the ki power gained at 4th level.</p>
			<p><b>Feinting Flurry: </b>At 4th level, a sage counselor can spend 1 ki point while performing a flurry of blows to feint an opponent as a swift action, but he can&#146;t spend 1 ki point to make an additional attack when making a flurry of blows. At 10th level, he can also choose to replace his first attack during a flurry of blows with a feint check.</p>
			<p>This ability alters flurry of blows and ki pool, and it replaces the bonus feat gained at 10th level.</p>
			<p><b>Ki Powers (Su): </b>At 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a monk can select one ki power. These powers allow the monk to perform amazing feats of mystical power and acrobatic prowess by expending points from his ki pool. Once a ki power is selected, it cannot be changed. Some ki powers require the monk to be of a specific level or higher before they can be chosen. Unless otherwise noted, a monk cannot select an individual ki power more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Still Mind (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a monk gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against enchantment spells and effects.</p>
			<p><b>Purity of Body (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a monk gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.</p>
			<p><b>Style Strike (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a monk can learn one type of style strike. Whenever he makes a flurry of blows, he can designate one of his unarmed strikes as a style strike. This attack is resolved as normal, but it has an additional effect depending on the type of strike chosen. At 9th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, a monk learns an additional style strike. He must choose which style strike to apply before the attack roll is made. At 15th level, he can designate up to two of his unarmed strikes each round as a style strike, and each one can be a different type. The monk can choose from any of the following strikes.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a monk&#146;s evasion ability improves. He still takes no damage on successful Reflex saving throws against attacks, but henceforth he takes only half damage on failed saves. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Tongue of the Sun and Moon (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a monk can understand and speak with any living creature, as if under a permanent tongues effect.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat: </b>At 14th level and 18th level, a monk can select a bonus feat. These feats must be taken from the following list: Catch Off-Guard, Combat Reflexes, Deflect Arrows, Dodge, Improved Grapple, Scorpion Style, and Throw Anything. At 6th level, the following feats are added to the list: Gorgon&#146;s Fist, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Disarm, Improved Feint, Improved Trip, and Mobility. At 10th level, the following feats are added to the list: Improved Critical, Medusa&#146;s Wrath, Snatch Arrows, and Spring Attack. A monk need not have any of the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex): </b>At 17th level, a monk no longer takes penalties to his ability scores for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any such penalties that he has already taken, however, remain in place. Age bonuses still accrue, and the monk still dies of old age when his time is up.</p>
			<p><b>Flawless Mind: </b>At 19th level, a monk gains total control over his mental faculties. Whenever he attempts a Will save, he can roll twice and take the better result. If he fails a Will saving throw against a spell or effect that has a duration longer than 1 hour, the monk can attempt a new saving throw at the end of each hour to end the effect.</p>
			<p><b>Perfect Self: </b>At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical creature. He is forevermore treated as an outsider rather than a humanoid (or whatever his original creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects. Additionally, the monk gains damage reduction 10/chaotic, which allows him to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a nonchaotic weapon. Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if he were a member of his previous creature type. Finally, the monk gains the ability to enter a state of perfect calm. During this time, the monk can take no actions, but he does regain ki at the rate of 1 point per 10 minutes spent at calm. He cannot use this ability to gain an amount of ki in excess of his maximum.</p>
			<h>Ex-Monks</h>
			<p>A monk who becomes nonlawful cannot gain new levels as a monk but retains all monk abilities.</p>

					<p>At 1st level, a monk can make a flurry of blows as a full-attack action. When making a flurry of blows, the monk can make one additional attack at his highest base attack bonus. This additional attack stacks with the bonus attacks from haste and other similar effects. When using this ability, the monk can make these attacks with any combination of his unarmed strikes and weapons that have the monk special weapon quality. He takes no penalty for using multiple weapons when making a flurry of blows, but he does not gain any additional attacks beyond what&#146;s already granted by the flurry for doing so. (He can still gain additional attacks from a high base attack bonus, from this ability, and from haste and similar effects).</p>

This means that a monk can make unarmed strikes with his hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk can apply his full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all his unarmed strikes. A monk&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, although he can choose to deal nonlethal damage with no penalty on his attack roll. He can make this choice while grappling as well.</p>
					<p>A monk&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
					<p>The damage dealt by a monk&#146;s unarmed strike is determined by the unarmed damage column on Table 1&#150;2: Monk. The damage listed is for Medium monks. The damage for Small or Large monks is listed below.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level, a monk gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy he can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in a monk&#146;s ki pool is equal to 1/2 his monk level + his Wisdom modifier. As long as he has at least 1 point in his ki pool, he can make a ki strike. At 3rd level, ki strike allows his unarmed attacks to be treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 7th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 10th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 16th level, his unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
					<p>By spending 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action, a monk can make one additional unarmed strike at his highest attack bonus when making a flurry of blows attack. This bonus attack stacks with all bonus attacks gained from flurry of blows, as well as those from haste and similar effects. A monk gains additional powers that consume points from his ki pool as he gains levels.</p>
					<p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>

Monks are also able to harness their ki, a spiritual life force that resides within, allowing them to perform amazing acts of acrobatics and mystical skill. All of this depends on incredible discipline and focus, and monks spend their entire lives perfecting these arts.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>Much of the monk has been reworked, including its base attack bonus, Hit Die, saves, and many of its special abilities. The result is a version of the monk that not only is easier to play, but also possesses a great deal more versatility. Flurry of blows is now much simpler to use in play. Many of the higher-level abilities of the monk, such as abundant step and quivering palm, have been incorporated into the new system of ki powers. As a monk advances in level, he can select from a variety of ki powers, allowing the player to truly customize his character.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any lawful.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p>S <b>tarting Wealth: </b>1d6 x 10 gp (average 35 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Monk (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex), and Swim (Str).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Monks are proficient with the club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe, javelin, kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, short sword, shortspear, shuriken, siangham, sling, spear, and any weapon with the monk special weapon quality.</p>
			<p>Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields.</p>
			<p>When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses his AC bonus, as well as his fast movement and flurry of blows abilities.</p>
			<p><b>AC Bonus (Ex): </b>When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds his Wisdom bonus (if any) to his AC and CMD. In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC and CMD at 4th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every four monk levels thereafter, up to a maximum of +5 at 20th level.</p>
			<p>These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is flat-footed. He loses these bonuses when he is immobilized or helpless, when he wears any armor, when he carries a shield, or when he carries a medium or heavy load.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat: </b>At 1st level, 2nd level, and every 4 levels thereafter, a monk can select a bonus feat. These feats must be taken from the following list: Catch Off-Guard, Combat Reflexes, Deflect Arrows, Dodge, Improved Grapple, Scorpion Style, and Throw Anything. At 6th level, the following feats are added to the list: Gorgon&#146;s Fist, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Disarm, Improved Feint, Improved Trip, and Mobility. At 10th level, the following feats are added to the list: Improved Critical, Medusa&#146;s Wrath, Snatch Arrows, and Spring Attack. A monk need not have any of the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.</p>
			<p><b>Flurry of Blows (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a monk can make a flurry of blows as a full-attack action. When making a flurry of blows, the monk can make one additional attack at his highest base attack bonus. This additional attack stacks with the bonus attacks from haste and other similar effects. When using this ability, the monk can make these attacks with any combination of his unarmed strikes and weapons that have the monk special weapon quality. He takes no penalty for using multiple weapons when making a flurry of blows, but he does not gain any additional attacks beyond what&#146;s already granted by the flurry for doing so. (He can still gain additional attacks from a high base attack bonus, from this ability, and from haste and similar effects).</p>
			<p>At 11th level, a monk can make an additional attack at his highest base attack bonus whenever he makes a flurry of blows. This stacks with the first attack from this ability and additional attacks from haste and similar effects.</p>
			<p><b>Stunning Fist (Ex): </b>At 1st level, the monk gains Stunning Fist as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. At 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, the monk gains the ability to apply a new condition to the target of his Stunning Fist. This condition replaces stunning the target for 1 round, and a successful saving throw still negates the effect. At 4th level, the monk can choose to make the target fatigued. At 8th level, he can make the target sickened for 1 minute. At 12th level, he can make the target staggered for 1d6+1 rounds. At 16th level, he can permanently blind or deafen the target. At 20th level, he can paralyze the target for 1d6+1 rounds. The monk must choose which condition will apply before the attack roll is made. These effects do not stack with themselves (a creature fatigued by Stunning Fist cannot become exhausted if hit by Stunning Fist again), but additional hits do increase the duration.</p>
			<p><b>Unarmed Strike (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A monk&#146;s attacks can be with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk can make unarmed strikes with his hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk can apply his full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all his unarmed strikes. A monk&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, although he can choose to deal nonlethal damage with no penalty on his attack roll. He can make this choice while grappling as well.</p>
			<p>A monk&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
			<p>The damage dealt by a monk&#146;s unarmed strike is determined by the unarmed damage column on Table 1&#150;2: Monk. The damage listed is for Medium monks. The damage for Small or Large monks is listed below.</p>

			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a monk can avoid damage from many area-effect attacks. If a monk succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a monk gains an enhancement bonus to his land speed, as shown on Table 1&#150;2. A monk in armor or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.</p>
			<p><b>Ki Pool (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a monk gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy he can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in a monk&#146;s ki pool is equal to 1/2 his monk level + his Wisdom modifier. As long as he has at least 1 point in his ki pool, he can make a ki strike. At 3rd level, ki strike allows his unarmed attacks to be treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 7th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 10th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 16th level, his unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
			<p>By spending 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action, a monk can make one additional unarmed strike at his highest attack bonus when making a flurry of blows attack. This bonus attack stacks with all bonus attacks gained from flurry of blows, as well as those from haste and similar effects. A monk gains additional powers that consume points from his ki pool as he gains levels.</p>
			<p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
			<p><b>Ki Powers (Su): </b>At 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a monk can select one ki power. These powers allow the monk to perform amazing feats of mystical power and acrobatic prowess by expending points from his ki pool. Once a ki power is selected, it cannot be changed. Some ki powers require the monk to be of a specific level or higher before they can be chosen. Unless otherwise noted, a monk cannot select an individual ki power more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from Failure (Ex): </b>At 4th level, when the perfect scholar misses with an attack roll or fails a Research check (Ultimate Intrigue 148), he gains a +1 insight bonus on his next attack roll or Research check against the same target attempted in the next 24 hours. An individual target cannot be affected by this ability more than once in a 24-hour period. At 6th level, and every 2 monk levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the ki power gained at 4th level.</p>
			<p><b>Lore (Ex): </b>At 4th level, the perfect scholar gains a bonus equal to 1/2 his monk level on Knowledge checks and can attempt Knowledge checks untrained.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces still mind.</p>
			<p><b>Purity of Body (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a monk gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.</p>
			<p><b>Style Strike (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a monk can learn one type of style strike. Whenever he makes a flurry of blows, he can designate one of his unarmed strikes as a style strike. This attack is resolved as normal, but it has an additional effect depending on the type of strike chosen. At 9th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, a monk learns an additional style strike. He must choose which style strike to apply before the attack roll is made. At 15th level, he can designate up to two of his unarmed strikes each round as a style strike, and each one can be a different type. The monk can choose from any of the following strikes.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a monk&#146;s evasion ability improves. He still takes no damage on successful Reflex saving throws against attacks, but henceforth he takes only half damage on failed saves. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Eye of the Sun and Moon (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a perfect scholar can read all languages and write all languages he has read or heard.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces tongue of the sun and moon.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex): </b>At 17th level, a monk no longer takes penalties to his ability scores for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any such penalties that he has already taken, however, remain in place. Age bonuses still accrue, and the monk still dies of old age when his time is up.</p>
			<p><b>Flawless Mind: </b>At 19th level, a monk gains total control over his mental faculties. Whenever he attempts a Will save, he can roll twice and take the better result. If he fails a Will saving throw against a spell or effect that has a duration longer than 1 hour, the monk can attempt a new saving throw at the end of each hour to end the effect.</p>
			<p><b>Walk with the Master (Su): </b>At 20th level, the perfect scholar has mastered his spiritual resonance, allowing him to travel as if using etherealness, plane shift, or shadow walk at his monk level by spending only 1 point from his ki pool. He cannot bring other creatures with him. He is treated as an outsider rather than his original type, although he can be brought back to life as if he were still of his former type.</p>
			<p>This ability alters perfect self.</p>
			<h>Ex-Monks</h>
			<p>A monk who becomes nonlawful cannot gain new levels as a monk but retains all monk abilities.</p>

					<p>At 11th level, a monk can make an additional attack at his highest base attack bonus whenever he makes a flurry of blows. This stacks with the first attack from this ability and additional attacks from haste and similar effects.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, the monk gains Stunning Fist as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. At 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, the monk gains the ability to apply a new condition to the target of his Stunning Fist. This condition replaces stunning the target for 1 round, and a successful saving throw still negates the effect. At 4th level, the monk can choose to make the target fatigued. At 8th level, he can make the target sickened for 1 minute. At 12th level, he can make the target staggered for 1d6+1 rounds. At 16th level, he can permanently blind or deafen the target. At 20th level, he can paralyze the target for 1d6+1 rounds. The monk must choose which condition will apply before the attack roll is made. These effects do not stack with themselves (a creature fatigued by Stunning Fist cannot become exhausted if hit by Stunning Fist again), but additional hits do increase the duration.</p>

				<name type="string">Unarmed Strike</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A monk&#146;s attacks can be with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk can make unarmed strikes with his hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk can apply his full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all his unarmed strikes. A monk&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, although he can choose to deal nonlethal damage with no penalty on his attack roll. He can make this choice while grappling as well.</p>
					<p>A monk&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
					<p>The damage dealt by a monk&#146;s unarmed strike is determined by the unarmed damage column on Table 1&#150;2: Monk. The damage listed is for Medium monks. The damage for Small or Large monks is listed below.</p>

If a monk succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level, a monk gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy he can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in a monk&#146;s ki pool is equal to 1/2 his monk level + his Wisdom modifier. As long as he has at least 1 point in his ki pool, he can make a ki strike. At 3rd level, ki strike allows his unarmed attacks to be treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 7th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 10th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 16th level, his unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
					<p>By spending 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action, a monk can make one additional unarmed strike at his highest attack bonus when making a flurry of blows attack. This bonus attack stacks with all bonus attacks gained from flurry of blows, as well as those from haste and similar effects. A monk gains additional powers that consume points from his ki pool as he gains levels.</p>
					<p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A body contains many points where the flesh, mind, and spirit coincide. A monk of the mantis is skilled at manipulating these points. With precise strikes, she temporarily disrupts a body&#146;s connection with the rest of the self.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Physical and mental perfection&#151;that is the life goal of every monk. For these skilled warriors, martial prowess and mental clarity are one and the same. Capable of pummeling foes with both f ist and weapon, monks are among the more versatile combatants on the battlef ield. Monks are also able to harness their ki, a spiritual life force that resides within, allowing them to perform amazing acts of acrobatics and mystical skill. All of this depends on incredible discipline and focus, and monks spend their entire lives perfecting these arts.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>Much of the monk has been reworked, including its base attack bonus, Hit Die, saves, and many of its special abilities. The result is a version of the monk that not only is easier to play, but also possesses a great deal more versatility. Flurry of blows is now much simpler to use in play. Many of the higher-level abilities of the monk, such as abundant step and quivering palm, have been incorporated into the new system of ki powers. As a monk advances in level, he can select from a variety of ki powers, allowing the player to truly customize his character.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any lawful.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p>S <b>tarting Wealth: </b>1d6 x 10 gp (average 35 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Monk (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex), and Swim (Str).</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Monks are proficient with the club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe, javelin, kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, short sword, shortspear, shuriken, siangham, sling, spear, and any weapon with the monk special weapon quality.</p>
			<p>Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields.</p>
			<p>When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses his AC bonus, as well as his fast movement and flurry of blows abilities.</p>
			<p><b>AC Bonus (Ex): </b>When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds his Wisdom bonus (if any) to his AC and CMD. In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC and CMD at 4th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every four monk levels thereafter, up to a maximum of +5 at 20th level.</p>
			<p>These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is flat-footed. He loses these bonuses when he is immobilized or helpless, when he wears any armor, when he carries a shield, or when he carries a medium or heavy load.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat: </b>At 1st level, a monk can select a bonus feat. These feats must be taken from the following list: Catch Off-Guard, Combat Reflexes, Deflect Arrows, Dodge, Improved Grapple, Scorpion Style, and Throw Anything.</p>
			<p><b>Flurry of Blows (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a monk can make a flurry of blows as a full-attack action. When making a flurry of blows, the monk can make one additional attack at his highest base attack bonus. This additional attack stacks with the bonus attacks from haste and other similar effects. When using this ability, the monk can make these attacks with any combination of his unarmed strikes and weapons that have the monk special weapon quality. He takes no penalty for using multiple weapons when making a flurry of blows, but he does not gain any additional attacks beyond what&#146;s already granted by the flurry for doing so. (He can still gain additional attacks from a high base attack bonus, from this ability, and from haste and similar effects).</p>
			<p>At 11th level, a monk can make an additional attack at his highest base attack bonus whenever he makes a flurry of blows. This stacks with the first attack from this ability and additional attacks from haste and similar effects.</p>
			<p><b>Stunning Fist (Ex): </b>At 1st level, the monk gains Stunning Fist as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. At 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, the monk gains the ability to apply a new condition to the target of his Stunning Fist. This condition replaces stunning the target for 1 round, and a successful saving throw still negates the effect. At 4th level, the monk can choose to make the target fatigued. At 8th level, he can make the target sickened for 1 minute. At 12th level, he can make the target staggered for 1d6+1 rounds. At 16th level, he can permanently blind or deafen the target. At 20th level, he can paralyze the target for 1d6+1 rounds. The monk must choose which condition will apply before the attack roll is made. These effects do not stack with themselves (a creature fatigued by Stunning Fist cannot become exhausted if hit by Stunning Fist again), but additional hits do increase the duration.</p>
			<p><b>Unarmed Strike (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A monk&#146;s attacks can be with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk can make unarmed strikes with his hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk can apply his full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all his unarmed strikes. A monk&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, although he can choose to deal nonlethal damage with no penalty on his attack roll. He can make this choice while grappling as well.</p>
			<p>A monk&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
			<p>The damage dealt by a monk&#146;s unarmed strike is determined by the unarmed damage column on Table 1&#150;2: Monk. The damage listed is for Medium monks. The damage for Small or Large monks is listed below.</p>

			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a monk can avoid damage from many area-effect attacks. If a monk succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Pressuring Strikes (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a monk of the mantis gains the sneak attack ability. This ability functions as the rogue ability of the same name, except it can be used only during a flurry of blows. The initial sneak attack damage is +1d6, and the damage increases by 1d6 every 4 levels beyond 2nd. This ability replaces the monk&#146;s 2nd-, 6th-, 10th-, 14th-, and 18th-level bonus feats.</p>
			<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a monk gains an enhancement bonus to his land speed, as shown on Table 1&#150;2. A monk in armor or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.</p>
			<p><b>Ki Pool (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a monk gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy he can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in a monk&#146;s ki pool is equal to 1/2 his monk level + his Wisdom modifier. As long as he has at least 1 point in his ki pool, he can make a ki strike. At 3rd level, ki strike allows his unarmed attacks to be treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 7th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 10th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 16th level, his unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
			<p>By spending 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action, a monk can make one additional unarmed strike at his highest attack bonus when making a flurry of blows attack. This bonus attack stacks with all bonus attacks gained from flurry of blows, as well as those from haste and similar effects. A monk gains additional powers that consume points from his ki pool as he gains levels.</p>
			<p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
			<p><b>Ki Powers (Su): </b>At 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a monk can select one ki power. These powers allow the monk to perform amazing feats of mystical power and acrobatic prowess by expending points from his ki pool. Once a ki power is selected, it cannot be changed. Some ki powers require the monk to be of a specific level or higher before they can be chosen. Unless otherwise noted, a monk cannot select an individual ki power more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Still Mind (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a monk gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against enchantment spells and effects.</p>
			<p><b>Purity of Body (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a monk gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.</p>
			<p><b>Style Strike (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a monk can learn one type of style strike. Whenever he makes a flurry of blows, he can designate one of his unarmed strikes as a style strike. This attack is resolved as normal, but it has an additional effect depending on the type of strike chosen. At 9th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, a monk learns an additional style strike. He must choose which style strike to apply before the attack roll is made. At 15th level, he can designate up to two of his unarmed strikes each round as a style strike, and each one can be a different type. The monk can choose from any of the following strikes.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Blows (Ex): </b>A monk of the mantis&#146;s knowledge of anatomy allows her to deal blows that both deal damage and impose debilitating conditions. At 6th level, if a monk of the mantis stuns a target with Stunning Fist, the target is also entangled for 1 round after the Stunning Fist effect ends. At 10th level, if the monk of the mantis stuns a target with Stunning Fist, the target is also exhausted for 1 round after the Stunning Fist effect ends. At 12th level, the monk can spend 1 point from her ki pool as part of her Stunning Fist attack to increase the duration of these additional effects to a number of rounds equal to her Wisdom bonus (minimum 2 rounds). This ability replaces the 6th, 10th, and 12th-level ki powers.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a monk&#146;s evasion ability improves. He still takes no damage on successful Reflex saving throws against attacks, but henceforth he takes only half damage on failed saves. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Tongue of the Sun and Moon (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a monk can understand and speak with any living creature, as if under a permanent tongues effect.</p>
			<p><b>Disabling Palm (Su): </b>At 15th level, a monk of the mantis can render the target of her quivering palm unconscious instead of killing the creature. Upon failing its Fortitude saving throw, the target either is knocked unconscious for a number of minutes equal to the monk of the mantis&#146;s monk level or dies (the monk of the mantis&#146;s choice). This ability applies only if the monk selects the quivering palm ki power.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex): </b>At 17th level, a monk no longer takes penalties to his ability scores for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any such penalties that he has already taken, however, remain in place. Age bonuses still accrue, and the monk still dies of old age when his time is up.</p>
			<p><b>Flawless Mind: </b>At 19th level, a monk gains total control over his mental faculties. Whenever he attempts a Will save, he can roll twice and take the better result. If he fails a Will saving throw against a spell or effect that has a duration longer than 1 hour, the monk can attempt a new saving throw at the end of each hour to end the effect.</p>
			<p><b>Perfect Self: </b>At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical creature. He is forevermore treated as an outsider rather than a humanoid (or whatever his original creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects. Additionally, the monk gains damage reduction 10/chaotic, which allows him to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a nonchaotic weapon. Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if he were a member of his previous creature type. Finally, the monk gains the ability to enter a state of perfect calm. During this time, the monk can take no actions, but he does regain ki at the rate of 1 point per 10 minutes spent at calm. He cannot use this ability to gain an amount of ki in excess of his maximum.</p>
			<h>Ex-Monks</h>
			<p>A monk who becomes nonlawful cannot gain new levels as a monk but retains all monk abilities.</p>

At 7th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 10th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 16th level, his unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
					<p>By spending 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action, a monk can make one additional unarmed strike at his highest attack bonus when making a flurry of blows attack. This bonus attack stacks with all bonus attacks gained from flurry of blows, as well as those from haste and similar effects. A monk gains additional powers that consume points from his ki pool as he gains levels.</p>
					<p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Those studied in the art of grappling know that using their opponents&#146; own weight and momentum to lift, disable, or throw them is impressive and effective. When facing a master of the lifting hand, an enemy is likely to find itself sailing through the air or locked in a tortuous compliance hold.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Physical and mental perfection&#151;that is the life goal of every monk. For these skilled warriors, martial prowess and mental clarity are one and the same. Capable of pummeling foes with both f ist and weapon, monks are among the more versatile combatants on the battlef ield. Monks are also able to harness their ki, a spiritual life force that resides within, allowing them to perform amazing acts of acrobatics and mystical skill. All of this depends on incredible discipline and focus, and monks spend their entire lives perfecting these arts.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>Much of the monk has been reworked, including its base attack bonus, Hit Die, saves, and many of its special abilities. The result is a version of the monk that not only is easier to play, but also possesses a great deal more versatility. Flurry of blows is now much simpler to use in play. Many of the higher-level abilities of the monk, such as abundant step and quivering palm, have been incorporated into the new system of ki powers. As a monk advances in level, he can select from a variety of ki powers, allowing the player to truly customize his character.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any lawful.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p>S <b>tarting Wealth: </b>1d6 x 10 gp (average 35 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Monk (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Monks are proficient with the club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe, javelin, kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, short sword, shortspear, shuriken, siangham, sling, spear, and any weapon with the monk special weapon quality.</p>
			<p>Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields.</p>
			<p>When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses his AC bonus, as well as his fast movement and flurry of blows abilities.</p>
			<p><b>AC Bonus (Ex): </b>When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds his Wisdom bonus (if any) to his AC and CMD. In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC and CMD at 4th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every four monk levels thereafter, up to a maximum of +5 at 20th level.</p>
			<p>These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is flat-footed. He loses these bonuses when he is immobilized or helpless, when he wears any armor, when he carries a shield, or when he carries a medium or heavy load.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat: </b>At 1st level, 2nd level, and every 4 levels thereafter, a monk can select a bonus feat. These feats must be taken from the following list: Catch Off-Guard, Combat Reflexes, Deflect Arrows, Dodge, Improved Grapple, Scorpion Style, and Throw Anything. At 6th level, the following feats are added to the list: Gorgon&#146;s Fist, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Disarm, Improved Feint, Improved Trip, and Mobility. At 10th level, the following feats are added to the list: Improved Critical, Medusa&#146;s Wrath, Snatch Arrows, and Spring Attack. A monk need not have any of the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.</p>
			<p>A lifting hand adds Whirling Hold to her list of bonus feats at 1st level. At 6th level, she adds Dramatic Slam and Overhead Flip. At 10th level, she adds Savage Leap.</p>
			<p><b>Flurry of Blows (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a monk can make a flurry of blows as a full-attack action. When making a flurry of blows, the monk can make one additional attack at his highest base attack bonus. This additional attack stacks with the bonus attacks from haste and other similar effects. When using this ability, the monk can make these attacks with any combination of his unarmed strikes and weapons that have the monk special weapon quality. He takes no penalty for using multiple weapons when making a flurry of blows, but he does not gain any additional attacks beyond what&#146;s already granted by the flurry for doing so. (He can still gain additional attacks from a high base attack bonus, from this ability, and from haste and similar effects).</p>
			<p>At 11th level, a monk can make an additional attack at his highest base attack bonus whenever he makes a flurry of blows. This stacks with the first attack from this ability and additional attacks from haste and similar effects.</p>
			<p><b>Savage Toss (Ex): </b>A lifting hand gains Savage Slam as a bonus feat, even if she doesn&#146;t meet the prerequisites.</p>
			<p>At 4th level, when the lifting hand succeeds at her grapple combat maneuver check while using the Savage Slam feat and her grapple combat maneuver check result exceeds the opponent&#146;s CMD by at least 5, she can throw the opponent into an non-adjacent square. The lifting hand can throw the opponent 10 feet, plus an additional 5 feet for every 5 by which her grapple check exceeds the opponent&#146;s CMD. For instance, if the lifting monk exceeds the target&#146;s CMD by 15, she can throw the target into a square 20 feet away.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, when using Savage Slam, the lifting hand&#146;s target no longer receives a bonus to its CMD when the lifting hand attempts to throw it into a dangerous area.</p>
			<p>This replaces stunning fist.</p>
			<p><b>Unarmed Strike (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A monk&#146;s attacks can be with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk can make unarmed strikes with his hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk can apply his full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all his unarmed strikes. A monk&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, although he can choose to deal nonlethal damage with no penalty on his attack roll. He can make this choice while grappling as well.</p>
			<p>A monk&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
			<p>The damage dealt by a monk&#146;s unarmed strike is determined by the unarmed damage column on Table 1&#150;2: Monk. The damage listed is for Medium monks. The damage for Small or Large monks is listed below.</p>

			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a monk can avoid damage from many area-effect attacks. If a monk succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a monk gains an enhancement bonus to his land speed, as shown on Table 1&#150;2. A monk in armor or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.</p>
			<p><b>Ki Pool (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a monk gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy he can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in a monk&#146;s ki pool is equal to 1/2 his monk level + his Wisdom modifier. As long as he has at least 1 point in his ki pool, he can make a ki strike. At 3rd level, ki strike allows his unarmed attacks to be treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 7th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 10th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 16th level, his unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
			<p>By spending 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action, a monk can make one additional unarmed strike at his highest attack bonus when making a flurry of blows attack. This bonus attack stacks with all bonus attacks gained from flurry of blows, as well as those from haste and similar effects. A monk gains additional powers that consume points from his ki pool as he gains levels.</p>
			<p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
			<p><b>Ki Powers (Su): </b>At 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a monk can select one ki power. These powers allow the monk to perform amazing feats of mystical power and acrobatic prowess by expending points from his ki pool. Once a ki power is selected, it cannot be changed. Some ki powers require the monk to be of a specific level or higher before they can be chosen. Unless otherwise noted, a monk cannot select an individual ki power more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Still Mind (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a monk gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against enchantment spells and effects.</p>
			<p><b>Purity of Body (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a monk gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.</p>
			<p><b>Style Strike (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a monk can learn one type of style strike. Whenever he makes a flurry of blows, he can designate one of his unarmed strikes as a style strike. This attack is resolved as normal, but it has an additional effect depending on the type of strike chosen. At 9th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, a monk learns an additional style strike. He must choose which style strike to apply before the attack roll is made. At 15th level, he can designate up to two of his unarmed strikes each round as a style strike, and each one can be a different type. The monk can choose from any of the following strikes.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a monk&#146;s evasion ability improves. He still takes no damage on successful Reflex saving throws against attacks, but henceforth he takes only half damage on failed saves. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Joint Lock (Ex): </b>At 10th level, when a lifting hand succeeds at a combat maneuver check to maintain a grapple, instead of choosing to damage, move, pin, or tie up the opponent, she can instead force one of the target&#146;s limbs into an agonizing position. The target becomes sickened as long as the lifting hand maintains the grapple. When the grapple is released or broken, the target is fatigued for a number of rounds equal to the lifting hand&#146;s level. This is a pain effect.</p>
			<p>This replaces the bonus feat gained at 10th level.</p>
			<p><b>Counter-Throw (Sp): </b>At 12th level, a lifting hand can ready an action to trigger if a creature tries to attack her. When the readied action triggers, the lifting hand can attempt a grapple combat maneuver check with a +2 bonus. If she succeeds, she grapples the creature and negates the triggering attack, and she can spend an immediate action to use the Savage Slam feat.</p>
			<p>This replaces the ki power gained at 12th level.</p>
			<p><b>Tongue of the Sun and Moon (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a monk can understand and speak with any living creature, as if under a permanent tongues effect.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex): </b>At 17th level, a monk no longer takes penalties to his ability scores for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any such penalties that he has already taken, however, remain in place. Age bonuses still accrue, and the monk still dies of old age when his time is up.</p>
			<p><b>Flawless Mind: </b>At 19th level, a monk gains total control over his mental faculties. Whenever he attempts a Will save, he can roll twice and take the better result. If he fails a Will saving throw against a spell or effect that has a duration longer than 1 hour, the monk can attempt a new saving throw at the end of each hour to end the effect.</p>
			<p><b>Perfect Self: </b>At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical creature. He is forevermore treated as an outsider rather than a humanoid (or whatever his original creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects. Additionally, the monk gains damage reduction 10/chaotic, which allows him to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a nonchaotic weapon. Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if he were a member of his previous creature type. Finally, the monk gains the ability to enter a state of perfect calm. During this time, the monk can take no actions, but he does regain ki at the rate of 1 point per 10 minutes spent at calm. He cannot use this ability to gain an amount of ki in excess of his maximum.</p>

He takes no penalty for using multiple weapons when making a flurry of blows, but he does not gain any additional attacks beyond what&#146;s already granted by the flurry for doing so. (He can still gain additional attacks from a high base attack bonus, from this ability, and from haste and similar effects).</p>

At 8th level, he can make the target sickened for 1 minute. At 12th level, he can make the target staggered for 1d6+1 rounds. At 16th level, he can permanently blind or deafen the target. At 20th level, he can paralyze the target for 1d6+1 rounds. The monk must choose which condition will apply before the attack roll is made. These effects do not stack with themselves (a creature fatigued by Stunning Fist cannot become exhausted if hit by Stunning Fist again), but additional hits do increase the duration.</p>

					<p>At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A monk&#146;s attacks can be with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk can make unarmed strikes with his hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk can apply his full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all his unarmed strikes. A monk&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, although he can choose to deal nonlethal damage with no penalty on his attack roll. He can make this choice while grappling as well.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The invested regent has been handpicked by inscrutable divine forces to command others&#151;either at the present or at some future time. The invested regent can harness a divine spark to perform superhuman stunts, influence others, and escape injury. Invested regents come from all races and walks of life, but they are more likely to be nobleborn in their cultures. Although some invested regents are acutely aware of their powers&#146; divine origins (such as powers gained from an investment ceremony to Asmodeus in the nation of Cheliax), others do not know the source of their abilities. Invested regents have strong personalities and a destiny to rule.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Physical and mental perfection&#151;that is the life goal of every monk. For these skilled warriors, martial prowess and mental clarity are one and the same. Capable of pummeling foes with both f ist and weapon, monks are among the more versatile combatants on the battlef ield. Monks are also able to harness their ki, a spiritual life force that resides within, allowing them to perform amazing acts of acrobatics and mystical skill. All of this depends on incredible discipline and focus, and monks spend their entire lives perfecting these arts.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>Much of the monk has been reworked, including its base attack bonus, Hit Die, saves, and many of its special abilities. The result is a version of the monk that not only is easier to play, but also possesses a great deal more versatility. Flurry of blows is now much simpler to use in play. Many of the higher-level abilities of the monk, such as abundant step and quivering palm, have been incorporated into the new system of ki powers. As a monk advances in level, he can select from a variety of ki powers, allowing the player to truly customize his character.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any lawful.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p>S <b>tarting Wealth: </b>1d6 x 10 gp (average 35 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Monk (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Monks are proficient with the club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe, javelin, kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, short sword, shortspear, shuriken, siangham, sling, spear, and any weapon with the monk special weapon quality.</p>
			<p>Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields.</p>
			<p>When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses his AC bonus, as well as his fast movement and flurry of blows abilities.</p>
			<p><b>AC Bonus (Ex): </b>When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds his Wisdom bonus (if any) to his AC and CMD. In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC and CMD at 4th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every four monk levels thereafter, up to a maximum of +5 at 20th level.</p>
			<p>These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is flat-footed. He loses these bonuses when he is immobilized or helpless, when he wears any armor, when he carries a shield, or when he carries a medium or heavy load.</p>
			<p><b>Flurry of Blows (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a monk can make a flurry of blows as a full-attack action. When making a flurry of blows, the monk can make one additional attack at his highest base attack bonus. This additional attack stacks with the bonus attacks from haste and other similar effects. When using this ability, the monk can make these attacks with any combination of his unarmed strikes and weapons that have the monk special weapon quality. He takes no penalty for using multiple weapons when making a flurry of blows, but he does not gain any additional attacks beyond what&#146;s already granted by the flurry for doing so. (He can still gain additional attacks from a high base attack bonus, from this ability, and from haste and similar effects).</p>
			<p>At 11th level, a monk can make an additional attack at his highest base attack bonus whenever he makes a flurry of blows. This stacks with the first attack from this ability and additional attacks from haste and similar effects.</p>
			<p><b>Investiture (Su): </b>An invested regent gains a pool of investiture points, supernatural energy he can use to call upon amazing abilities and divine protection. The number of points in the invested regent&#146;s investiture pool is equal to 1/2 his monk level + his Charisma modifier. As long as he has at least 1 point in his investiture pool, the invested regent can select one of his saving throws as a swift action and gain a +1 sacred bonus on saving throws of that type for 1 round. If he spends 1 point from his investiture pool during this swift action, he instead gains a sacred bonus equal to his Charisma modifier on the saving throw selected.</p>
			<p>A character with this feature and the ki pool class feature tracks investiture points and ki points separately.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 1st level.</p>
			<p><b>Stunning Fist (Ex): </b>At 1st level, the monk gains Stunning Fist as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. At 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, the monk gains the ability to apply a new condition to the target of his Stunning Fist. This condition replaces stunning the target for 1 round, and a successful saving throw still negates the effect. At 4th level, the monk can choose to make the target fatigued. At 8th level, he can make the target sickened for 1 minute. At 12th level, he can make the target staggered for 1d6+1 rounds. At 16th level, he can permanently blind or deafen the target. At 20th level, he can paralyze the target for 1d6+1 rounds. The monk must choose which condition will apply before the attack roll is made. These effects do not stack with themselves (a creature fatigued by Stunning Fist cannot become exhausted if hit by Stunning Fist again), but additional hits do increase the duration.</p>
			<p><b>Unarmed Strike (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A monk&#146;s attacks can be with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk can make unarmed strikes with his hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk can apply his full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all his unarmed strikes. A monk&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, although he can choose to deal nonlethal damage with no penalty on his attack roll. He can make this choice while grappling as well.</p>
			<p>A monk&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
			<p>The damage dealt by a monk&#146;s unarmed strike is determined by the unarmed damage column on Table 1&#150;2: Monk. The damage listed is for Medium monks. The damage for Small or Large monks is listed below.</p>

			<p><b>Bonus Feat: </b>At 2nd level, and every 4 levels thereafter, a monk can select a bonus feat. These feats must be taken from the following list: Catch Off-Guard, Combat Reflexes, Deflect Arrows, Dodge, Improved Grapple, Scorpion Style, and Throw Anything. At 6th level, the following feats are added to the list: Gorgon&#146;s Fist, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Disarm, Improved Feint, Improved Trip, and Mobility. At 10th level, the following feats are added to the list: Improved Critical, Medusa&#146;s Wrath, Snatch Arrows, and Spring Attack. A monk need not have any of the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a monk can avoid damage from many area-effect attacks. If a monk succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Vested Power (Ex or Sp): </b>At 2nd level and every 4 monk levels thereafter, an invested regent can select a vested power (see the Vested Powers section below) for which he qualifies in place of selecting a monk bonus feat. The invested regent need not do so and can instead take the bonus feat, but once the decision to take a bonus feat or a vested power is made, he can&#146;t change it.</p>
			<p>This replaces the bonus feat the invested regent gives up for the vested power.</p>
			<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a monk gains an enhancement bonus to his land speed, as shown on Table 1&#150;2. A monk in armor or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.</p>
			<p><b>Ki Pool (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a monk gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy he can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in a monk&#146;s ki pool is equal to 1/2 his monk level + his Wisdom modifier. As long as he has at least 1 point in his ki pool, he can make a ki strike. At 3rd level, ki strike allows his unarmed attacks to be treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 7th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 10th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 16th level, his unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
			<p>By spending 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action, a monk can make one additional unarmed strike at his highest attack bonus when making a flurry of blows attack. This bonus attack stacks with all bonus attacks gained from flurry of blows, as well as those from haste and similar effects. A monk gains additional powers that consume points from his ki pool as he gains levels.</p>
			<p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
			<p><b>Ki Powers (Su): </b>At 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a monk can select one ki power. These powers allow the monk to perform amazing feats of mystical power and acrobatic prowess by expending points from his ki pool. Once a ki power is selected, it cannot be changed. Some ki powers require the monk to be of a specific level or higher before they can be chosen. Unless otherwise noted, a monk cannot select an individual ki power more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Still Mind (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a monk gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against enchantment spells and effects.</p>
			<p><b>Purity of Body (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a monk gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.</p>
			<p><b>Style Strike (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a monk can learn one type of style strike. Whenever he makes a flurry of blows, he can designate one of his unarmed strikes as a style strike. This attack is resolved as normal, but it has an additional effect depending on the type of strike chosen. At 9th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, a monk learns an additional style strike. He must choose which style strike to apply before the attack roll is made. At 15th level, he can designate up to two of his unarmed strikes each round as a style strike, and each one can be a different type. The monk can choose from any of the following strikes.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a monk&#146;s evasion ability improves. He still takes no damage on successful Reflex saving throws against attacks, but henceforth he takes only half damage on failed saves. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Tongue of the Sun and Moon (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a monk can understand and speak with any living creature, as if under a permanent tongues effect.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex): </b>At 17th level, a monk no longer takes penalties to his ability scores for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any such penalties that he has already taken, however, remain in place. Age bonuses still accrue, and the monk still dies of old age when his time is up.</p>
			<p><b>Flawless Mind: </b>At 19th level, a monk gains total control over his mental faculties. Whenever he attempts a Will save, he can roll twice and take the better result. If he fails a Will saving throw against a spell or effect that has a duration longer than 1 hour, the monk can attempt a new saving throw at the end of each hour to end the effect.</p>
			<p><b>Perfect Self: </b>At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical creature. He is forevermore treated as an outsider rather than a humanoid (or whatever his original creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects. Additionally, the monk gains damage reduction 10/chaotic, which allows him to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a nonchaotic weapon. Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if he were a member of his previous creature type. Finally, the monk gains the ability to enter a state of perfect calm. During this time, the monk can take no actions, but he does regain ki at the rate of 1 point per 10 minutes spent at calm. He cannot use this ability to gain an amount of ki in excess of his maximum.</p>
			<h>Ex-Monks</h>
			<p>A monk who becomes nonlawful cannot gain new levels as a monk but retains all monk abilities.</p>
			<h>Vested Powers</h>
			<p>Vested powers are abilities that draw on an invested regent&#146;s investiture pool. Vested powers are divided into two categories: feats and spells.</p>
			<p><b>Requirements: </b>All vested powers have a minimum level requirement to select them. An invested regent who hasn&#146;t reached the required monk level cannot select that vested power.</p>
			<p><b>Activation: </b>Most vested powers require the invested regent to spend investiture points; the exact amount is listed after the vested power. Vested powers that cost 0 investiture points don&#146;t require the invested regent to have any investiture points in his investiture pool to use the ability. The saving throw against an invested regent&#146;s vested power, if any, is equal to 10 + 1/2 the invested regent&#146;s monk level + his Charisma bonus.</p>
			<p><b>Feats: </b>These vested powers duplicate the effects of specific feats. An invested regent doesn&#146;t need to qualify for a feat to select it as a vested power. For example, an invested regent can select Spring Attack as a vested power even if he doesn&#146;t meet the prerequisites for selecting Spring Attack as a feat. Activating one of these vested powers is a free action on the invested regent&#146;s turn; until the start of his next turn, the invested regent is treated as if he had that feat. Feats marked with an asterisk (*) can also be activated as an immediate action when it isn&#146;t the invested regent&#146;s turn.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>These vested powers duplicate the effects of a spell and are spell-like abilities. An invested regent&#146;s monk level is the caster level for these spell-like abilities, and he uses Charisma to determine his concentration check bonus. Activating one of these vested powers is a standard action.</p>

This means that a monk can make unarmed strikes with his hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk can apply his full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all his unarmed strikes. A monk&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, although he can choose to deal nonlethal damage with no penalty on his attack roll. He can make this choice while grappling as well.</p>

					<p>At 2nd level, as a swift action an elemental monk can gain the benefits of one of the following style feats, based on one of the five types of genies. When she does so, she automatically enters that feat&#146;s stance: Djinni Style, Efreeti Style, Janni Style, Marid Style, or Shaitan Style. These feats, as well as those mentioned below, appear in Chapter 2 of Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat, and rules for style feats are on page 78 of that book.</p>
					<p>At 6th level, while the elemental monk is using a genie style feat, she also gains the benefits of a feat from the following list, as appropriate for that style&#146;s feat path: Djinni Spirit, Efreeti Stance, Janni Tempest, Marid Spirit, and Shaitan Skin.</p>
					<p>At 10th level, while the elemental monk is using a genie style feat, she also gains the benefits of a feat from the following list, as appropriate for that style&#146;s feat path: Djinni Spin, Efreeti Touch, Janni Rush, Marid Coldsnap, and Shaitan Earthblast.</p>
					<p>At 18th level, when the elemental monk gains the benefits of Djinni Spirit, Efreeti Stance, Marid Spirit, or Shaitan Skin, her elemental resistance from that feat instead becomes immunity to that element, as long as she is not denied her Dexterity bonus to AC. While she is using Janni Style, she gains the effects of enlarge person or reduce person (her choice), even if she is not humanoid. This is a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to the elemental monk&#146;s level.</p>

At 3rd level, ki strike allows his unarmed attacks to be treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 7th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 10th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

					<p>By spending 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action, a monk can make one additional unarmed strike at his highest attack bonus when making a flurry of blows attack. This bonus attack stacks with all bonus attacks gained from flurry of blows, as well as those from haste and similar effects. A monk gains additional powers that consume points from his ki pool as he gains levels.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Elemental monks draw inspiration from genies to create their fighting style. Their adaptability and versatility make them capable of serving as emissaries of elemental balance.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Physical and mental perfection&#151;that is the life goal of every monk. For these skilled warriors, martial prowess and mental clarity are one and the same. Capable of pummeling foes with both f ist and weapon, monks are among the more versatile combatants on the battlef ield. Monks are also able to harness their ki, a spiritual life force that resides within, allowing them to perform amazing acts of acrobatics and mystical skill. All of this depends on incredible discipline and focus, and monks spend their entire lives perfecting these arts.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>Much of the monk has been reworked, including its base attack bonus, Hit Die, saves, and many of its special abilities. The result is a version of the monk that not only is easier to play, but also possesses a great deal more versatility. Flurry of blows is now much simpler to use in play. Many of the higher-level abilities of the monk, such as abundant step and quivering palm, have been incorporated into the new system of ki powers. As a monk advances in level, he can select from a variety of ki powers, allowing the player to truly customize his character.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>An elemental monk must be true neutral.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p>S <b>tarting Wealth: </b>1d6 x 10 gp (average 35 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Monk (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex), and Swim (Str).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Monks are proficient with the club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe, javelin, kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, short sword, shortspear, shuriken, siangham, sling, spear, and any weapon with the monk special weapon quality.</p>
			<p>Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields.</p>
			<p>When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses his AC bonus, as well as his fast movement and flurry of blows abilities.</p>
			<p><b>AC Bonus (Ex): </b>When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds his Wisdom bonus (if any) to his AC and CMD. In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC and CMD at 4th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every four monk levels thereafter, up to a maximum of +5 at 20th level.</p>
			<p>These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is flat-footed. He loses these bonuses when he is immobilized or helpless, when he wears any armor, when he carries a shield, or when he carries a medium or heavy load.</p>
			<p><b>Elemental Strike (Ex): </b>An elemental monk gains Elemental Fist as a bonus feat, even if she doesn&#146;t meet the prerequisites. She does not have to select an element; instead, each time she hits with an Elemental Fist attack, she can choose acid, cold, electricity, or fire for the type of the additional damage granted by that feat.</p>
			<p><b>Flurry of Blows (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a monk can make a flurry of blows as a full-attack action. When making a flurry of blows, the monk can make one additional attack at his highest base attack bonus. This additional attack stacks with the bonus attacks from haste and other similar effects. When using this ability, the monk can make these attacks with any combination of his unarmed strikes and weapons that have the monk special weapon quality. He takes no penalty for using multiple weapons when making a flurry of blows, but he does not gain any additional attacks beyond what&#146;s already granted by the flurry for doing so. (He can still gain additional attacks from a high base attack bonus, from this ability, and from haste and similar effects).</p>
			<p>At 11th level, a monk can make an additional attack at his highest base attack bonus whenever he makes a flurry of blows. This stacks with the first attack from this ability and additional attacks from haste and similar effects.</p>
			<p><b>Unarmed Strike (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A monk&#146;s attacks can be with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk can make unarmed strikes with his hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk can apply his full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all his unarmed strikes. A monk&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, although he can choose to deal nonlethal damage with no penalty on his attack roll. He can make this choice while grappling as well.</p>
			<p>A monk&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
			<p>The damage dealt by a monk&#146;s unarmed strike is determined by the unarmed damage column on Table 1&#150;2: Monk. The damage listed is for Medium monks. The damage for Small or Large monks is listed below.</p>

			<p><b>Bonus Feat: </b>At 2nd level, and every 4 levels thereafter, a monk can select a bonus feat. These feats must be taken from the following list: Catch Off-Guard, Combat Reflexes, Deflect Arrows, Dodge, Improved Grapple, Scorpion Style, and Throw Anything. At 6th level, the following feats are added to the list: Gorgon&#146;s Fist, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Disarm, Improved Feint, Improved Trip, and Mobility. At 10th level, the following feats are added to the list: Improved Critical, Medusa&#146;s Wrath, Snatch Arrows, and Spring Attack. A monk need not have any of the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.</p>
			<p><b>Genie Style (Ex, Sp): </b>At 2nd level, as a swift action an elemental monk can gain the benefits of one of the following style feats, based on one of the five types of genies. When she does so, she automatically enters that feat&#146;s stance: Djinni Style, Efreeti Style, Janni Style, Marid Style, or Shaitan Style. These feats, as well as those mentioned below, appear in Chapter 2 of Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat, and rules for style feats are on page 78 of that book.At 6th level, while the elemental monk is using a genie style feat, she also gains the benefits of a feat from the following list, as appropriate for that style&#146;s feat path: Djinni Spirit, Efreeti Stance, Janni Tempest, Marid Spirit, and Shaitan Skin.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, while the elemental monk is using a genie style feat, she also gains the benefits of a feat from the following list, as appropriate for that style&#146;s feat path: Djinni Spin, Efreeti Touch, Janni Rush, Marid Coldsnap, and Shaitan Earthblast.</p>
			<p>At 18th level, when the elemental monk gains the benefits of Djinni Spirit, Efreeti Stance, Marid Spirit, or Shaitan Skin, her elemental resistance from that feat instead becomes immunity to that element, as long as she is not denied her Dexterity bonus to AC. While she is using Janni Style, she gains the effects of enlarge person or reduce person (her choice), even if she is not humanoid. This is a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to the elemental monk&#146;s level.</p>
			<p>This replaces evasion, purity of body, and the ki power gained at 10th-level.</p>
			<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a monk gains an enhancement bonus to his land speed, as shown on Table 1&#150;2. A monk in armor or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.</p>
			<p><b>Ki Pool (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a monk gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy he can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in a monk&#146;s ki pool is equal to 1/2 his monk level + his Wisdom modifier. As long as he has at least 1 point in his ki pool, he can make a ki strike. At 3rd level, ki strike allows his unarmed attacks to be treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 7th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 10th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 16th level, his unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
			<p>By spending 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action, a monk can make one additional unarmed strike at his highest attack bonus when making a flurry of blows attack. This bonus attack stacks with all bonus attacks gained from flurry of blows, as well as those from haste and similar effects. A monk gains additional powers that consume points from his ki pool as he gains levels.</p>
			<p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
			<p><b>Ki Powers (Su): </b>At 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a monk can select one ki power. These powers allow the monk to perform amazing feats of mystical power and acrobatic prowess by expending points from his ki pool. Once a ki power is selected, it cannot be changed. Some ki powers require the monk to be of a specific level or higher before they can be chosen. Unless otherwise noted, a monk cannot select an individual ki power more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Still Mind (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a monk gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against enchantment spells and effects.</p>
			<p><b>Style Strike (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a monk can learn one type of style strike. Whenever he makes a flurry of blows, he can designate one of his unarmed strikes as a style strike. This attack is resolved as normal, but it has an additional effect depending on the type of strike chosen. At 9th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, a monk learns an additional style strike. He must choose which style strike to apply before the attack roll is made. At 15th level, he can designate up to two of his unarmed strikes each round as a style strike, and each one can be a different type. The monk can choose from any of the following strikes.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a monk&#146;s evasion ability improves. He still takes no damage on successful Reflex saving throws against attacks, but henceforth he takes only half damage on failed saves. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Elemental Precision (Ex): </b>At 10th level, instead of treating her unarmed strikes as lawful for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction, an elemental monk overcomes all damage reduction of creatures with the air, earth, fire, or water subtypes except DR/&#151; and DR/epic.</p>
			<p>This alters the monk&#146;s ki pool.</p>
			<p><b>Tongue of the Sun and Moon (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a monk can understand and speak with any living creature, as if under a permanent tongues effect.</p>
			<p><b>Planar Guide (Sp): </b>At 14th level as a standard action, an elemental monk can spend 1 ki point to transport herself and up to seven additional willing creatures, as per the plane shift spell, to one of the four Elemental Planes. Each additional creature increases the cost by 1 ki point.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex): </b>At 17th level, a monk no longer takes penalties to his ability scores for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any such penalties that he has already taken, however, remain in place. Age bonuses still accrue, and the monk still dies of old age when his time is up.</p>
			<p><b>Flawless Mind: </b>At 19th level, a monk gains total control over his mental faculties. Whenever he attempts a Will save, he can roll twice and take the better result. If he fails a Will saving throw against a spell or effect that has a duration longer than 1 hour, the monk can attempt a new saving throw at the end of each hour to end the effect.</p>
			<p><b>Perfect Self: </b>At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical creature. He is forevermore treated as an outsider rather than a humanoid (or whatever his original creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects. Additionally, the monk gains damage reduction 10/chaotic, which allows him to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a nonchaotic weapon. Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if he were a member of his previous creature type. Finally, the monk gains the ability to enter a state of perfect calm. During this time, the monk can take no actions, but he does regain ki at the rate of 1 point per 10 minutes spent at calm. He cannot use this ability to gain an amount of ki in excess of his maximum.</p>
			<h>Ex-Monks</h>
			<p>A monk who becomes nonlawful cannot gain new levels as a monk but retains all monk abilities.</p>

These effects do not stack with themselves (a creature fatigued by Stunning Fist cannot become exhausted if hit by Stunning Fist again), but additional hits do increase the duration.</p>

				<name type="string">Unarmed Strike</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A monk&#146;s attacks can be with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk can make unarmed strikes with his hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk can apply his full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all his unarmed strikes. A monk&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, although he can choose to deal nonlethal damage with no penalty on his attack roll. He can make this choice while grappling as well.</p>
					<p>A monk&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
					<p>The damage dealt by a monk&#146;s unarmed strike is determined by the unarmed damage column on Table 1&#150;2: Monk. The damage listed is for Medium monks. The damage for Small or Large monks is listed below.</p>

					<p>At 2nd level, a monk can avoid damage from many area-effect attacks. If a monk succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 3rd level, a monk gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy he can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in a monk&#146;s ki pool is equal to 1/2 his monk level + his Wisdom modifier. As long as he has at least 1 point in his ki pool, he can make a ki strike. At 3rd level, ki strike allows his unarmed attacks to be treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 7th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 10th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 16th level, his unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
					<p>By spending 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action, a monk can make one additional unarmed strike at his highest attack bonus when making a flurry of blows attack. This bonus attack stacks with all bonus attacks gained from flurry of blows, as well as those from haste and similar effects. A monk gains additional powers that consume points from his ki pool as he gains levels.</p>
					<p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Disciples of wholeness train to bring themselves and others closer to physical and spiritual perfection.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Physical and mental perfection&#151;that is the life goal of every monk. For these skilled warriors, martial prowess and mental clarity are one and the same. Capable of pummeling foes with both f ist and weapon, monks are among the more versatile combatants on the battlef ield. Monks are also able to harness their ki, a spiritual life force that resides within, allowing them to perform amazing acts of acrobatics and mystical skill. All of this depends on incredible discipline and focus, and monks spend their entire lives perfecting these arts.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>Much of the monk has been reworked, including its base attack bonus, Hit Die, saves, and many of its special abilities. The result is a version of the monk that not only is easier to play, but also possesses a great deal more versatility. Flurry of blows is now much simpler to use in play. Many of the higher-level abilities of the monk, such as abundant step and quivering palm, have been incorporated into the new system of ki powers. As a monk advances in level, he can select from a variety of ki powers, allowing the player to truly customize his character.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any lawful.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p>S <b>tarting Wealth: </b>1d6 x 10 gp (average 35 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Monk (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Monks are proficient with the club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe, javelin, kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, short sword, shortspear, shuriken, siangham, sling, spear, and any weapon with the monk special weapon quality.</p>
			<p>Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields.</p>
			<p>When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses his AC bonus, as well as his fast movement and flurry of blows abilities.</p>
			<p><b>AC Bonus (Ex): </b>When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds his Wisdom bonus (if any) to his AC and CMD. In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC and CMD at 4th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every four monk levels thereafter, up to a maximum of +5 at 20th level.</p>
			<p>These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is flat-footed. He loses these bonuses when he is immobilized or helpless, when he wears any armor, when he carries a shield, or when he carries a medium or heavy load.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat: </b>At 1st level, 2nd level, and every 4 levels thereafter, a monk can select a bonus feat. These feats must be taken from the following list: Catch Off-Guard, Combat Reflexes, Deflect Arrows, Dodge, Improved Grapple, Scorpion Style, and Throw Anything. At 6th level, the following feats are added to the list: Gorgon&#146;s Fist, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Disarm, Improved Feint, Improved Trip, and Mobility. At 10th level, the following feats are added to the list: Improved Critical, Medusa&#146;s Wrath, Snatch Arrows, and Spring Attack. A monk need not have any of the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.</p>
			<p><b>Flurry of Blows (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a monk can make a flurry of blows as a full-attack action. When making a flurry of blows, the monk can make one additional attack at his highest base attack bonus. This additional attack stacks with the bonus attacks from haste and other similar effects. When using this ability, the monk can make these attacks with any combination of his unarmed strikes and weapons that have the monk special weapon quality. He takes no penalty for using multiple weapons when making a flurry of blows, but he does not gain any additional attacks beyond what&#146;s already granted by the flurry for doing so. (He can still gain additional attacks from a high base attack bonus, from this ability, and from haste and similar effects).</p>
			<p>At 11th level, a monk can make an additional attack at his highest base attack bonus whenever he makes a flurry of blows. This stacks with the first attack from this ability and additional attacks from haste and similar effects.</p>
			<p><b>Stunning Fist (Ex): </b>At 1st level, the monk gains Stunning Fist as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. At 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, the monk gains the ability to apply a new condition to the target of his Stunning Fist. This condition replaces stunning the target for 1 round, and a successful saving throw still negates the effect. At 4th level, the monk can choose to make the target fatigued. At 8th level, he can make the target sickened for 1 minute. At 12th level, he can make the target staggered for 1d6+1 rounds. At 16th level, he can permanently blind or deafen the target. At 20th level, he can paralyze the target for 1d6+1 rounds. The monk must choose which condition will apply before the attack roll is made. These effects do not stack with themselves (a creature fatigued by Stunning Fist cannot become exhausted if hit by Stunning Fist again), but additional hits do increase the duration.</p>
			<p><b>Unarmed Strike (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A monk&#146;s attacks can be with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk can make unarmed strikes with his hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk can apply his full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all his unarmed strikes. A monk&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, although he can choose to deal nonlethal damage with no penalty on his attack roll. He can make this choice while grappling as well.</p>
			<p>A monk&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
			<p>The damage dealt by a monk&#146;s unarmed strike is determined by the unarmed damage column on Table 1&#150;2: Monk. The damage listed is for Medium monks. The damage for Small or Large monks is listed below.</p>

			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a monk can avoid damage from many area-effect attacks. If a monk succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a monk gains an enhancement bonus to his land speed, as shown on Table 1&#150;2. A monk in armor or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.</p>
			<p><b>Healing Ki (Su): </b>At 4th level, a disciple of wholeness can touch a creature as a swift action and spend 1 point from her ki pool to restore a number of hit points equal to 1d4 + 1/2 her monk level to that creature. If she has the wholeness of body ki power, she can spend 2 points to restore a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + her monk level to a touched creature. She does not gain the ability to spend ki to gain an extra attack during a flurry of blows.</p>
			<p>This ability alters ki pool, and it replaces the ki power gained at 4th level.</p>
			<p><b>Ki Pool (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a monk gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy he can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in a monk&#146;s ki pool is equal to 1/2 his monk level + his Wisdom modifier. As long as he has at least 1 point in his ki pool, he can make a ki strike. At 3rd level, ki strike allows his unarmed attacks to be treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 7th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 10th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 16th level, his unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
			<p>By spending 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action, a monk can make one additional unarmed strike at his highest attack bonus when making a flurry of blows attack. This bonus attack stacks with all bonus attacks gained from flurry of blows, as well as those from haste and similar effects. A monk gains additional powers that consume points from his ki pool as he gains levels.</p>
			<p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
			<p><b>Ki Powers (Su): </b>At 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a monk can select one ki power. These powers allow the monk to perform amazing feats of mystical power and acrobatic prowess by expending points from his ki pool. Once a ki power is selected, it cannot be changed. Some ki powers require the monk to be of a specific level or higher before they can be chosen. Unless otherwise noted, a monk cannot select an individual ki power more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Still Mind (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a monk gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against enchantment spells and effects.</p>
			<p><b>Hone Body (Su): </b>At 5th level, a disciple of wholeness has immunity to supernatural and magical diseases as long as she is undamaged (she loses this immunity when she has hit point or ability score damage). In addition, she can always touch a creature as a swift action and spend 1 point from her ki pool to render it immune to all diseases for 1 day. She cannot grant this immunity if the target is already afflicted with a disease.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces purity of body.</p>
			<p><b>Style Strike (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a monk can learn one type of style strike. Whenever he makes a flurry of blows, he can designate one of his unarmed strikes as a style strike. This attack is resolved as normal, but it has an additional effect depending on the type of strike chosen. At 9th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, a monk learns an additional style strike. He must choose which style strike to apply before the attack roll is made. At 15th level, he can designate up to two of his unarmed strikes each round as a style strike, and each one can be a different type. The monk can choose from any of the following strikes.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a monk&#146;s evasion ability improves. He still takes no damage on successful Reflex saving throws against attacks, but henceforth he takes only half damage on failed saves. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Hone Body (Su): </b>At 11th level, a disciple of wholeness is immune to poison while undamaged and can grant immunity to poison (lasting for 1 day). This ability otherwise functions as per hone body.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the ki power gained at 12th level (and an unchained monk cannot gain the diamond body ki power).</p>
			<p><b>Hone Soul (Su): </b>At 13th level, a disciple of wholeness can dispel a spell affecting a living creature by touching it as a standard action and spending 1 point from her ki pool. This power functions like the targeted dispel option of greater dispel magic, with the caster level equal to the disciple of wholeness&#146;s monk level.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the ki power gained at 14th level (and an unchained monk cannot gain the diamond soul ki power).</p>
			<p><b>Tongue of the Sun and Moon (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a monk can understand and speak with any living creature, as if under a permanent tongues effect.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex): </b>At 17th level, a monk no longer takes penalties to his ability scores for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any such penalties that he has already taken, however, remain in place. Age bonuses still accrue, and the monk still dies of old age when his time is up.</p>
			<p><b>Flawless Mind: </b>At 19th level, a monk gains total control over his mental faculties. Whenever he attempts a Will save, he can roll twice and take the better result. If he fails a Will saving throw against a spell or effect that has a duration longer than 1 hour, the monk can attempt a new saving throw at the end of each hour to end the effect.</p>
			<p><b>Perfect Self: </b>At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical creature. He is forevermore treated as an outsider rather than a humanoid (or whatever his original creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects. Additionally, the monk gains damage reduction 10/chaotic, which allows him to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a nonchaotic weapon. Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if he were a member of his previous creature type. Finally, the monk gains the ability to enter a state of perfect calm. During this time, the monk can take no actions, but he does regain ki at the rate of 1 point per 10 minutes spent at calm. He cannot use this ability to gain an amount of ki in excess of his maximum.</p>
			<h>Ex-Monks</h>
			<p>A monk who becomes nonlawful cannot gain new levels as a monk but retains all monk abilities.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Of the three monasteries, the Monastery of Unblinking Flame has been the most successful in developing a specific and unique fighting style that sets its disciples apart from other monks. In order to be admitted into the Monastery of Unblinking Flame and become one of these disciples, a supplicant must prove his worth by outwitting an efreeti. Those who succeed often become monks known as the brazen disciples.</i></p>
			<p><i>Brazen disciples believe that the best way to prepare for this test is to emulate the efreeti&#146;s own duplicitous ways. By studying genie contracts, brazen disciples learn how to take advantage of loopholes, and by pondering riddles, they learn how to obfuscate truth. They use deception in their fighting style, and many go a step further, incorporating fire and smoke both mundane and magical. Though most brazen disciples focus on joining the Houses of Perfection, some become enamored with the efreet and instead seek out genie masters.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Physical and mental perfection&#151;that is the life goal of every monk. For these skilled warriors, martial prowess and mental clarity are one and the same. Capable of pummeling foes with both f ist and weapon, monks are among the more versatile combatants on the battlef ield. Monks are also able to harness their ki, a spiritual life force that resides within, allowing them to perform amazing acts of acrobatics and mystical skill. All of this depends on incredible discipline and focus, and monks spend their entire lives perfecting these arts.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>Much of the monk has been reworked, including its base attack bonus, Hit Die, saves, and many of its special abilities. The result is a version of the monk that not only is easier to play, but also possesses a great deal more versatility. Flurry of blows is now much simpler to use in play. Many of the higher-level abilities of the monk, such as abundant step and quivering palm, have been incorporated into the new system of ki powers. As a monk advances in level, he can select from a variety of ki powers, allowing the player to truly customize his character.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any lawful.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p>S <b>tarting Wealth: </b>1d6 x 10 gp (average 35 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Monk (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Stealth (Dex).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Monks are proficient with the club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe, javelin, kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, short sword, shortspear, shuriken, siangham, sling, spear, and any weapon with the monk special weapon quality.</p>
			<p>Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields.</p>
			<p>When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses his AC bonus, as well as his fast movement and flurry of blows abilities.</p>
			<p><b>AC Bonus (Ex): </b>When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds his Wisdom bonus (if any) to his AC and CMD. In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC and CMD at 4th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every four monk levels thereafter, up to a maximum of +5 at 20th level.</p>
			<p>These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is flat-footed. He loses these bonuses when he is immobilized or helpless, when he wears any armor, when he carries a shield, or when he carries a medium or heavy load.</p>
			<p><b>Feinting Flurry (Ex): </b>When using flurry of blows to make melee attacks, a brazen disciple can forgo his first attack to attempt a Bluff check to feint. At 6th level, when a brazen disciple successfully feints, his opponent is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC until the end of the monk&#146;s turn.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the monk&#146;s bonus feats at 1st level and at 6th level.</p>
			<p><b>Flurry of Blows (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a monk can make a flurry of blows as a full-attack action. When making a flurry of blows, the monk can make one additional attack at his highest base attack bonus. This additional attack stacks with the bonus attacks from haste and other similar effects. When using this ability, the monk can make these attacks with any combination of his unarmed strikes and weapons that have the monk special weapon quality. He takes no penalty for using multiple weapons when making a flurry of blows, but he does not gain any additional attacks beyond what&#146;s already granted by the flurry for doing so. (He can still gain additional attacks from a high base attack bonus, from this ability, and from haste and similar effects).</p>
			<p>At 11th level, a monk can make an additional attack at his highest base attack bonus whenever he makes a flurry of blows. This stacks with the first attack from this ability and additional attacks from haste and similar effects.</p>
			<p><b>Stunning Fist (Ex): </b>At 1st level, the monk gains Stunning Fist as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. At 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, the monk gains the ability to apply a new condition to the target of his Stunning Fist. This condition replaces stunning the target for 1 round, and a successful saving throw still negates the effect. At 4th level, the monk can choose to make the target fatigued. At 8th level, he can make the target sickened for 1 minute. At 12th level, he can make the target staggered for 1d6+1 rounds. At 16th level, he can permanently blind or deafen the target. At 20th level, he can paralyze the target for 1d6+1 rounds. The monk must choose which condition will apply before the attack roll is made. These effects do not stack with themselves (a creature fatigued by Stunning Fist cannot become exhausted if hit by Stunning Fist again), but additional hits do increase the duration.</p>
			<p><b>Unarmed Strike (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A monk&#146;s attacks can be with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk can make unarmed strikes with his hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk can apply his full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all his unarmed strikes. A monk&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, although he can choose to deal nonlethal damage with no penalty on his attack roll. He can make this choice while grappling as well.</p>
			<p>A monk&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
			<p>The damage dealt by a monk&#146;s unarmed strike is determined by the unarmed damage column on Table 1&#150;2: Monk. The damage listed is for Medium monks. The damage for Small or Large monks is listed below.</p>

			<p><b>Bonus Feat: </b>At 2nd, 10th, 14th, and 18th levels, a brazen disciple can select a bonus feat. These feats must be chosen from the following list: Catch Off-Guard, Combat Reflexes, Deceitful, Dodge, Elemental FistAPG, and Improved Initiative. At 6th level, the brazen disciple can also choose from the following feats: Efreeti StyleUC, Improved Dirty TrickAPG, Improved Disarm, Improved StealAPG, Improved Trip, and Mobility. At 10th level, the brazen disciple can also choose from the following feats: Efreeti StanceUC, Efreeti TouchUC, Improved Critical, and Spring Attack. He need not meet the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a monk can avoid damage from many area-effect attacks. If a monk succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Efreeti&#146;s Guile (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a brazen disciple can add his Wisdom modifier on Bluff and Disguise checks instead of his Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces still mind</p>
			<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a monk gains an enhancement bonus to his land speed, as shown on Table 1&#150;2. A monk in armor or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.</p>
			<p><b>Ki Pool (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a monk gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy he can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in a monk&#146;s ki pool is equal to 1/2 his monk level + his Wisdom modifier. As long as he has at least 1 point in his ki pool, he can make a ki strike. At 3rd level, ki strike allows his unarmed attacks to be treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 7th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 10th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 16th level, his unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
			<p>By spending 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action, a monk can make one additional unarmed strike at his highest attack bonus when making a flurry of blows attack. This bonus attack stacks with all bonus attacks gained from flurry of blows, as well as those from haste and similar effects. A monk gains additional powers that consume points from his ki pool as he gains levels.</p>
			<p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
			<p><b>Ki Powers (Su): </b>At 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a monk can select one ki power. These powers allow the monk to perform amazing feats of mystical power and acrobatic prowess by expending points from his ki pool. Once a ki power is selected, it cannot be changed. Some ki powers require the monk to be of a specific level or higher before they can be chosen. Unless otherwise noted, a monk cannot select an individual ki power more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Purity of Body (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a monk gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.</p>
			<p><b>Style Strike (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a monk can learn one type of style strike. Whenever he makes a flurry of blows, he can designate one of his unarmed strikes as a style strike. This attack is resolved as normal, but it has an additional effect depending on the type of strike chosen. At 9th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, a monk learns an additional style strike. He must choose which style strike to apply before the attack roll is made. At 15th level, he can designate up to two of his unarmed strikes each round as a style strike, and each one can be a different type. The monk can choose from any of the following strikes.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a monk&#146;s evasion ability improves. He still takes no damage on successful Reflex saving throws against attacks, but henceforth he takes only half damage on failed saves. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Confounding Koan (Sp): </b>At 12th level, a brazen disciple can spend 2 ki points as a standard action to confuse a target within 30 feet with a riddle or paradox. This ability functions as per confusion, except that it is language-dependent. The DC is equal to 10 + half the monk&#146;s class level + his Wisdom modifier, and the caster level is equal to his class level.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the monk&#146;s ki ability gained at 12th level.</p>
			<p><b>Tongue of the Sun and Moon (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a monk can understand and speak with any living creature, as if under a permanent tongues effect.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex): </b>At 17th level, a monk no longer takes penalties to his ability scores for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any such penalties that he has already taken, however, remain in place. Age bonuses still accrue, and the monk still dies of old age when his time is up.</p>
			<p><b>Flawless Mind: </b>At 19th level, a monk gains total control over his mental faculties. Whenever he attempts a Will save, he can roll twice and take the better result. If he fails a Will saving throw against a spell or effect that has a duration longer than 1 hour, the monk can attempt a new saving throw at the end of each hour to end the effect.</p>
			<p><b>Genie Apotheosis: </b>At 20th level, a brazen disciple is treated as a native outsider with the fire subtype rather than as a humanoid (or whatever the monk&#146;s creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects. He has immunity to fire and vulnerability to cold. Once per day, the brazen disciple can grant a limited wish (as per the spell limited wish) to a non-outsider as a spell-like ability (CL 20th).</p>

He cannot use this ability to gain an amount of ki in excess of his maximum.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The black asps are a sinister order of monks who train as assassins and infiltrators with no need for weapons to achieve their goals. Through meditation and study, they learn how to use poison, hide any magics they choose to employ, and even empty their minds of thought to protect themselves from divinations.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Physical and mental perfection&#151;that is the life goal of every monk. For these skilled warriors, martial prowess and mental clarity are one and the same. Capable of pummeling foes with both f ist and weapon, monks are among the more versatile combatants on the battlef ield. Monks are also able to harness their ki, a spiritual life force that resides within, allowing them to perform amazing acts of acrobatics and mystical skill. All of this depends on incredible discipline and focus, and monks spend their entire lives perfecting these arts.</p>
			<p><b>Unchained: </b>Much of the monk has been reworked, including its base attack bonus, Hit Die, saves, and many of its special abilities. The result is a version of the monk that not only is easier to play, but also possesses a great deal more versatility. Flurry of blows is now much simpler to use in play. Many of the higher-level abilities of the monk, such as abundant step and quivering palm, have been incorporated into the new system of ki powers. As a monk advances in level, he can select from a variety of ki powers, allowing the player to truly customize his character.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any lawful.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p>S <b>tarting Wealth: </b>1d6 x 10 gp (average 35 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Monk (Unchained)'s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Monks are proficient with the club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe, javelin, kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, short sword, shortspear, shuriken, siangham, sling, spear, and any weapon with the monk special weapon quality.</p>
			<p>Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields.</p>
			<p>When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses his AC bonus, as well as his fast movement and flurry of blows abilities.</p>
			<p><b>AC Bonus (Ex): </b>When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds his Wisdom bonus (if any) to his AC and CMD. In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC and CMD at 4th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every four monk levels thereafter, up to a maximum of +5 at 20th level.</p>
			<p>These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is flat-footed. He loses these bonuses when he is immobilized or helpless, when he wears any armor, when he carries a shield, or when he carries a medium or heavy load.</p>
			<p><b>Black Asp&#146;s Path (Ex): </b>A black asp is trained in the use of poison and cannot accidentally poison himself when applying poison to a weapon or when rolling a natural 1 on an attack roll with a poisoned weapon. At 3rd level, the black asp&#146;s ability to use poison improves. He gains Adder StrikeUC as a bonus feat even if he does not meet the prerequisites.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces stunning fist and still mind.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat: </b>At 1st level, 2nd level, and every 4 levels thereafter, a monk can select a bonus feat. These feats must be taken from the following list: Catch Off-Guard, Combat Reflexes, Deflect Arrows, Dodge, Improved Grapple, Scorpion Style, and Throw Anything. At 6th level, the following feats are added to the list: Gorgon&#146;s Fist, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Disarm, Improved Feint, Improved Trip, and Mobility. At 10th level, the following feats are added to the list: Improved Critical, Medusa&#146;s Wrath, Snatch Arrows, and Spring Attack. A monk need not have any of the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.</p>
			<p><b>Flurry of Blows (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a monk can make a flurry of blows as a full-attack action. When making a flurry of blows, the monk can make one additional attack at his highest base attack bonus. This additional attack stacks with the bonus attacks from haste and other similar effects. When using this ability, the monk can make these attacks with any combination of his unarmed strikes and weapons that have the monk special weapon quality. He takes no penalty for using multiple weapons when making a flurry of blows, but he does not gain any additional attacks beyond what&#146;s already granted by the flurry for doing so. (He can still gain additional attacks from a high base attack bonus, from this ability, and from haste and similar effects).</p>
			<p>At 11th level, a monk can make an additional attack at his highest base attack bonus whenever he makes a flurry of blows. This stacks with the first attack from this ability and additional attacks from haste and similar effects.</p>
			<p><b>Unarmed Strike (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A monk&#146;s attacks can be with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk can make unarmed strikes with his hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk can apply his full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all his unarmed strikes. A monk&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, although he can choose to deal nonlethal damage with no penalty on his attack roll. He can make this choice while grappling as well.</p>
			<p>A monk&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
			<p>The damage dealt by a monk&#146;s unarmed strike is determined by the unarmed damage column on Table 1&#150;2: Monk. The damage listed is for Medium monks. The damage for Small or Large monks is listed below.</p>

			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a monk can avoid damage from many area-effect attacks. If a monk succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a monk gains an enhancement bonus to his land speed, as shown on Table 1&#150;2. A monk in armor or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.</p>
			<p><b>Ki Pool (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a monk gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy he can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in a monk&#146;s ki pool is equal to 1/2 his monk level + his Wisdom modifier. As long as he has at least 1 point in his ki pool, he can make a ki strike. At 3rd level, ki strike allows his unarmed attacks to be treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 7th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 10th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 16th level, his unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
			<p>By spending 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action, a monk can make one additional unarmed strike at his highest attack bonus when making a flurry of blows attack. This bonus attack stacks with all bonus attacks gained from flurry of blows, as well as those from haste and similar effects. A monk gains additional powers that consume points from his ki pool as he gains levels.</p>
			<p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
			<p><b>Forbidden Powers (Su): </b>A black asp can select a forbidden ki power as a ki power. The black asp can select any of the following forbidden ki powers.</p>
			<p><i>Black Asp Venom (Su): </i>As a swift action, a black asp with this ki power can poison his unarmed strike or a weapon in his hand. The poison lasts for 1 minute or until expended. A creature damaged by the poisoned weapon is affected as per the poison spell. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the black asp&#146;s monk level + his Wisdom modifier. Each use of this ability costs 2 ki points. A black asp must be at least 12th level before selecting this ki power.</p>
			<p><i>Empty Mind (Sp): </i>A black asp with this ki power can choose to lower the number of ki points in his ki pool by 3 when he recovers his ki points for the day. If he does so, he gains the benefits of mind blank for 24 hours. A black asp must be at least 16th level and possess the greater hidden magic ki power before selecting this ki power.</p>
			<p><i>Greater Hidden Magic (Sp): </i>As long as he has at least 1 point in his ki pool, all of the black asp&#146;s items are constantly under the effects of magic aura. As an immediate action, he can spend 2 ki points to cause himself and any magic items he is carrying to appear to be nonmagical (as if he had cast greater magic aura) for 1 hour per monk level. A black asp must be at least 8th level and possess the hidden magic ki power before selecting this ki power.</p>
			<p><i>Hidden Magic (Sp): </i>As an immediate action, the black asp can spend 1 ki point to hide the auras of all magic items he is carrying (as if they were all under magic aura) for 1 hour per monk level.</p>
			<p><i>Shifting Form (Su): </i>As an immediate action, a black asp can spend 1 ki point to make his outline shift and waver for 1 round. This ability otherwise functions as per the spell blur.</p>
			<p><b>Ki Powers (Su): </b>At 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a monk can select one ki power. These powers allow the monk to perform amazing feats of mystical power and acrobatic prowess by expending points from his ki pool. Once a ki power is selected, it cannot be changed. Some ki powers require the monk to be of a specific level or higher before they can be chosen. Unless otherwise noted, a monk cannot select an individual ki power more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Still Mind (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a monk gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against enchantment spells and effects.</p>
			<p><b>Purity of Body (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a monk gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.</p>
			<p><b>Style Strike (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a monk can learn one type of style strike. Whenever he makes a flurry of blows, he can designate one of his unarmed strikes as a style strike. This attack is resolved as normal, but it has an additional effect depending on the type of strike chosen. At 9th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, a monk learns an additional style strike. He must choose which style strike to apply before the attack roll is made. At 15th level, he can designate up to two of his unarmed strikes each round as a style strike, and each one can be a different type. The monk can choose from any of the following strikes.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a monk&#146;s evasion ability improves. He still takes no damage on successful Reflex saving throws against attacks, but henceforth he takes only half damage on failed saves. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Tongue of the Sun and Moon (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a monk can understand and speak with any living creature, as if under a permanent tongues effect.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex): </b>At 17th level, a monk no longer takes penalties to his ability scores for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any such penalties that he has already taken, however, remain in place. Age bonuses still accrue, and the monk still dies of old age when his time is up.</p>
			<p><b>Flawless Mind: </b>At 19th level, a monk gains total control over his mental faculties. Whenever he attempts a Will save, he can roll twice and take the better result. If he fails a Will saving throw against a spell or effect that has a duration longer than 1 hour, the monk can attempt a new saving throw at the end of each hour to end the effect.</p>
			<p><b>Perfect Self: </b>At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical creature. He is forevermore treated as an outsider rather than a humanoid (or whatever his original creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects. Additionally, the monk gains damage reduction 10/chaotic, which allows him to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a nonchaotic weapon. Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if he were a member of his previous creature type. Finally, the monk gains the ability to enter a state of perfect calm. During this time, the monk can take no actions, but he does regain ki at the rate of 1 point per 10 minutes spent at calm. He cannot use this ability to gain an amount of ki in excess of his maximum.</p>
			<h>Ex-Monks</h>
			<p>A monk who becomes nonlawful cannot gain new levels as a monk but retains all monk abilities.</p>
