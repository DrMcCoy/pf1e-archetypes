				<name type="string">Ki Pool</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 2nd level, a ninja gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy she can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in the ninja's ki pool is equal to 1/2 her ninja level + her Charisma modifier. As long as she has at least 1 point in her ki pool, she treats any Acrobatics skill check made to jump as if she had a running start. At 10th level, she also reduces the DC of Acrobatics skill checks made to jump by 1/2 (although she still cannot move farther than her speed allows).</p>
					<p>By spending 1 point from her ki pool, a ninja can make one additional attack at her highest attack bonus, but she can do so only when making a full attack. In addition, she can spend 1 point to increase her speed by 20 feet for 1 round. Finally, a ninja can spend 1 point from her ki pool to give herself a +4 insight bonus on Stealth checks for 1 round. Each of these powers is activated as a swift action. A ninja can gain additional powers that consume points from her ki pool by selecting certain ninja tricks.</p>
					<p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive. If the ninja possesses levels in another class that grants points to a ki pool, ninja levels stack with the levels of that class to determine the total number of ki points in the combined pool, but only one ability score modifier is added to the total. The choice of which score to use is made when the second class ability is gained, and once made, the choice is set. The ninja can now use ki points from this pool to power the abilities of every class she possesses that grants a ki pool.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Starting at 4th level, a ninja can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A ninja with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 6th level, a ninja learns to move while barely touching the surface underneath her. As a full-round action, she can move up to twice her speed, ignoring difficult terrain. While moving in this way, any surface will support her, no matter how much she weighs. This allows her to move across water, lava, or even the thinnest tree branches. She must end her move on a surface that can support her normally. She cannot move across air in this way, nor can she walk up walls or other vertical surfaces. When moving in this way, she does not take damage from surfaces or hazards that react to being touched, such as lava or caltrops, nor does she need to make Acrobatics checks to avoid falling on slippery or rough surfaces. Finally, when using light steps, the ninja ignores any mechanical traps that use a location-based trigger.</p>

					<p>At 20th level, a ninja becomes a true master of her art. She can, as a standard action, cast greater invisibility on herself. While invisible in this way, she cannot be detected by any means, and not even invisibility purge, see invisibility, and true seeing can reveal her. She uses her ninja level as her caster level for this ability. Using this ability consumes 3 ki points from her ki pool. In addition, whenever the ninja deals sneak attack damage, she can sacrifice additional damage dice to apply a penalty to one ability score of the target equal to the number of dice sacrificed for 1 minute. This penalty does not stack with itself and cannot reduce an ability score below 1.</p>

			<p>When the wealthy and the powerful need an enemy eliminated quietly and without fail, they call upon the ninja. When a general needs to sabotage the siege engines of his foes before they can reach the castle walls, he calls upon the ninja. And when fools dare to move against a ninja or her companions, they will find the ninja waiting for them while they sleep, ready to strike. These shadowy killers are masters of infiltration, sabotage, and assassination, using a wide variety of weapons, practiced skills, and mystical powers to achieve their goals.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The ninja spends almost all of her time honing her skills, practicing her art, or working on her next assignment. Even when not specifically working, the ninja is ever vigilant and ready for the situation to turn deadly. Her line of work earns her many enemies, but it is a list that she frequently reduces through assassination and misdirection. The ninja is an alternate class for the rogue core class.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ninja's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Ninja are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the kama, katana, kusarigama, nunchaku, sai, shortbow, short sword, shuriken, siangham, and wakizashi. They are proficient with light armor but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Use: </b>At 1st level, a ninja is trained in the use of poison and cannot accidentally poison herself when applying poison to a weapon.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a ninja can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The ninja's attacks deal extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the ninja flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every two ninja levels thereafter. Bonus damage from sneak attacks is precision damage. Should the ninja score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this precision damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, whip, or unarmed strike), a ninja can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The ninja must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot, and must be able to reach this spot. A ninja cannot sneak attack while striking a creature that has concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Ki Pool (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a ninja gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy she can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in the ninja's ki pool is equal to 1/2 her ninja level + her Charisma modifier. As long as she has at least 1 point in her ki pool, she treats any Acrobatics skill check made to jump as if she had a running start. At 10th level, she also reduces the DC of Acrobatics skill checks made to jump by 1/2 (although she still cannot move farther than her speed allows).</p>
			<p>By spending 1 point from her ki pool, a ninja can make one additional attack at her highest attack bonus, but she can do so only when making a full attack. In addition, she can spend 1 point to increase her speed by 20 feet for 1 round. Finally, a ninja can spend 1 point from her ki pool to give herself a +4 insight bonus on Stealth checks for 1 round. Each of these powers is activated as a swift action. A ninja can gain additional powers that consume points from her ki pool by selecting certain ninja tricks.</p>
			<p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive. If the ninja possesses levels in another class that grants points to a ki pool, ninja levels stack with the levels of that class to determine the total number of ki points in the combined pool, but only one ability score modifier is added to the total. The choice of which score to use is made when the second class ability is gained, and once made, the choice is set. The ninja can now use ki points from this pool to power the abilities of every class she possesses that grants a ki pool.</p>
			<p><b>Ninja Tricks: </b>As a ninja continues her training, she learns a number of tricks that allow her to confuse her foes and grant her supernatural abilities. Starting at 2nd level, a ninja gains one ninja trick. She gains one additional ninja trick for every 2 levels attained after 2nd. Unless otherwise noted, a ninja cannot select an individual ninja trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>No Trace (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ninja learns to cover her tracks, remain hidden, and conceal her presence. The DC to track a ninja using the Survival skill increases by +1. In addition, her training gives her a +1 insight bonus on Disguise skill checks and on opposed Stealth checks whenever she is stationary and does not take any action for at least 1 round. Every three levels thereafter, the increase to Survival DCs and the bonuses on Disguise and opposed Stealth checks increase by 1.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>Starting at 4th level, a ninja can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A ninja with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a ninja already possesses uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead.</p>
			<p><b>Light Steps (Ex): </b>At 6th level, a ninja learns to move while barely touching the surface underneath her. As a full-round action, she can move up to twice her speed, ignoring difficult terrain. While moving in this way, any surface will support her, no matter how much she weighs. This allows her to move across water, lava, or even the thinnest tree branches. She must end her move on a surface that can support her normally. She cannot move across air in this way, nor can she walk up walls or other vertical surfaces. When moving in this way, she does not take damage from surfaces or hazards that react to being touched, such as lava or caltrops, nor does she need to make Acrobatics checks to avoid falling on slippery or rough surfaces. Finally, when using light steps, the ninja ignores any mechanical traps that use a location-based trigger.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a ninja can no longer be flanked. This defense denies another ninja (or rogue) the ability to sneak attack the ninja by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more ninja (or rogue) levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack when determining the minimum ninja (or rogue) level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Master Tricks: </b>At 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a ninja can select one of the following master tricks in place of a ninja trick.</p>
			<p><b>Hidden Master (Su): </b>At 20th level, a ninja becomes a true master of her art. She can, as a standard action, cast greater invisibility on herself. While invisible in this way, she cannot be detected by any means, and not even invisibility purge, see invisibility, and true seeing can reveal her. She uses her ninja level as her caster level for this ability. Using this ability consumes 3 ki points from her ki pool. In addition, whenever the ninja deals sneak attack damage, she can sacrifice additional damage dice to apply a penalty to one ability score of the target equal to the number of dice sacrificed for 1 minute. This penalty does not stack with itself and cannot reduce an ability score below 1.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Petal ninjas are a secretive clan of ghoran infiltrators, in touch with their plantlike nature to the point where they can change their forms, allowing them access into places that were previously impossible to reach.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>When the wealthy and the powerful need an enemy eliminated quietly and without fail, they call upon the ninja. When a general needs to sabotage the siege engines of his foes before they can reach the castle walls, he calls upon the ninja. And when fools dare to move against a ninja or her companions, they will find the ninja waiting for them while they sleep, ready to strike. These shadowy killers are masters of infiltration, sabotage, and assassination, using a wide variety of weapons, practiced skills, and mystical powers to achieve their goals.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The ninja spends almost all of her time honing her skills, practicing her art, or working on her next assignment. Even when not specifically working, the ninja is ever vigilant and ready for the situation to turn deadly. Her line of work earns her many enemies, but it is a list that she frequently reduces through assassination and misdirection. The ninja is an alternate class for the rogue core class.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Race: </b>Ghoran Only</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ninja's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>8 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Ninja are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the kama, katana, kusarigama, nunchaku, sai, shortbow, short sword, shuriken, siangham, and wakizashi. They are proficient with light armor but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Use: </b>At 1st level, a ninja is trained in the use of poison and cannot accidentally poison herself when applying poison to a weapon.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a ninja can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The ninja's attacks deal extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the ninja flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every two ninja levels thereafter. Bonus damage from sneak attacks is precision damage. Should the ninja score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this precision damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, whip, or unarmed strike), a ninja can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The ninja must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot, and must be able to reach this spot. A ninja cannot sneak attack while striking a creature that has concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Ki Pool (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a ninja gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy she can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in the ninja's ki pool is equal to 1/2 her ninja level + her Charisma modifier. As long as she has at least 1 point in her ki pool, she treats any Acrobatics skill check made to jump as if she had a running start. At 10th level, she also reduces the DC of Acrobatics skill checks made to jump by 1/2 (although she still cannot move farther than her speed allows).</p>
			<p>By spending 1 point from her ki pool, a ninja can make one additional attack at her highest attack bonus, but she can do so only when making a full attack. In addition, she can spend 1 point to increase her speed by 20 feet for 1 round. Finally, a ninja can spend 1 point from her ki pool to give herself a +4 insight bonus on Stealth checks for 1 round. Each of these powers is activated as a swift action. A ninja can gain additional powers that consume points from her ki pool by selecting certain ninja tricks.</p>
			<p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive. If the ninja possesses levels in another class that grants points to a ki pool, ninja levels stack with the levels of that class to determine the total number of ki points in the combined pool, but only one ability score modifier is added to the total. The choice of which score to use is made when the second class ability is gained, and once made, the choice is set. The ninja can now use ki points from this pool to power the abilities of every class she possesses that grants a ki pool.</p>
			<p>Blossom Shower (Ex): At 2nd level, as a standard action, a petal ninja can spend 1 ki point to create a burst of flower petals in a 15-foot radius centered on a point within 20 feet. A blossom shower lasts for a number of rounds equal to half the petal ninja&#146;s level (minimum 1 round).</p>
			<p>When activating a blossom shower, the petal ninja forgoes a number of sneak attack dice to determine the shower&#146;s effects, as noted below. These sneak attack dice are unavailable for the duration of the blossom shower and are regained when the effect ends. If an effect requires a saving throw, the DC is equal to 10 + twice the number of sneak attack dice expended + the petal ninja&#146;s Charisma modifier. The petal ninja can choose to create a lesser effect even if she expends more dice than required. For example, she can expend 4 sneak attack dice, but impart the effect of 3 sneak attack dice. The shower does not affect the petal ninja herself, apart from the concealment granted by using 1 sneak attack die.</p>
			<p><i>1 Sneak Attack Die: </i>Creatures within the radius gain concealment (20% miss chance).</p>
			<p><i>2 Sneak Attack Dice: </i>As 1 sneak attack die, except each creature in the radius must succeed at a Will save or be dazzled for 1d6 rounds.</p>
			<p><i>3 Sneak Attack Dice: </i>As 2 sneak attack dice, except creatures are sickened on a failed save.</p>
			<p><i>4 Sneak Attack Dice: </i>As 2 sneak attack dice, except creatures are fascinated on a failed save.</p>
			<p><i>5 Sneak Attack Dice: </i>As 2 sneak attack dice, except creatures are staggered on a failed save.</p>
			<p><i>6 Sneak Attack Dice </i>: As 2 sneak attack dice, except creatures are nauseated on a failed save.</p>
			<p><b>Burst of Blossoms (Su): </b>At 4th level, a petal ninja gains the ability to transform into a cloud of blossoms as a standard action. By spending 1 point from her ki pool, a petal ninja can take the form of a cloud of blossoms, becoming insubstantial for 1 round, as gaseous form. While insubstantial she also gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks. At 8th level, the duration increases to a number of rounds equal to 1 plus the petal ninja&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Ninja Tricks: </b>As a ninja continues her training, she learns a number of tricks that allow her to confuse her foes and grant her supernatural abilities. Starting at 4th level, a ninja gains one ninja trick. She gains one additional ninja trick for every 2 levels attained after 2nd. Unless otherwise noted, a ninja cannot select an individual ninja trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Sundial (Su): </b>At 6th level, the petal ninja gains the ability to change the lighting in a 30-foot-radius emanation centered on herself as a move action. For every ki point she spends, the light levels change by one step (from darkness to dim light, normal light, and bright light, and vice versa). This change remains in effect for 1 minute.</p>
			<p><b>Master Tricks: </b>At 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a ninja can select one of the following master tricks in place of a ninja trick.</p>
			<p><b>Hidden Master (Su): </b>At 20th level, a ninja becomes a true master of her art. She can, as a standard action, cast greater invisibility on herself. While invisible in this way, she cannot be detected by any means, and not even invisibility purge, see invisibility, and true seeing can reveal her.

				<name type="string">Ki Pool</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 2nd level, a ninja gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy she can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in the ninja's ki pool is equal to 1/2 her ninja level + her Charisma modifier. As long as she has at least 1 point in her ki pool, she treats any Acrobatics skill check made to jump as if she had a running start. At 10th level, she also reduces the DC of Acrobatics skill checks made to jump by 1/2 (although she still cannot move farther than her speed allows).</p>
					<p>By spending 1 point from her ki pool, a ninja can make one additional attack at her highest attack bonus, but she can do so only when making a full attack. In addition, she can spend 1 point to increase her speed by 20 feet for 1 round. Finally, a ninja can spend 1 point from her ki pool to give herself a +4 insight bonus on Stealth checks for 1 round. Each of these powers is activated as a swift action. A ninja can gain additional powers that consume points from her ki pool by selecting certain ninja tricks.</p>
					<p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive. If the ninja possesses levels in another class that grants points to a ki pool, ninja levels stack with the levels of that class to determine the total number of ki points in the combined pool, but only one ability score modifier is added to the total. The choice of which score to use is made when the second class ability is gained, and once made, the choice is set. The ninja can now use ki points from this pool to power the abilities of every class she possesses that grants a ki pool.</p>

She must end her move on a surface that can support her normally. She cannot move across air in this way, nor can she walk up walls or other vertical surfaces. When moving in this way, she does not take damage from surfaces or hazards that react to being touched, such as lava or caltrops, nor does she need to make Acrobatics checks to avoid falling on slippery or rough surfaces.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>When the Living God needs to silence the voices of those heretics who question too loudly, these enforcers are the tools he employs.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>When the wealthy and the powerful need an enemy eliminated quietly and without fail, they call upon the ninja. When a general needs to sabotage the siege engines of his foes before they can reach the castle walls, he calls upon the ninja. And when fools dare to move against a ninja or her companions, they will find the ninja waiting for them while they sleep, ready to strike. These shadowy killers are masters of infiltration, sabotage, and assassination, using a wide variety of weapons, practiced skills, and mystical powers to achieve their goals.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The ninja spends almost all of her time honing her skills, practicing her art, or working on her next assignment. Even when not specifically working, the ninja is ever vigilant and ready for the situation to turn deadly. Her line of work earns her many enemies, but it is a list that she frequently reduces through assassination and misdirection. The ninja is an alternate class for the rogue core class.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Ninja are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the kama, katana, kusarigama, nunchaku, sai, shortbow, short sword, shuriken, siangham, and wakizashi. They are proficient with light armor but not with shields.</p>
			<p>In addition to having the ninja&#146;s normal weapon and armor proficiencies, the mask of the Living God is proficient with bolas, saps, and whips.</p>
			<p><b>Mask (Ex): </b>A mask of the Living God has a mask that is a symbol of his faith and the myriad powers invested in him. Abilities granted by this class other than undercover faith function only while the mask of the Living God is wearing his mask. Putting on or removing this mask is a move action.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a ninja can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The ninja's attacks deal extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the ninja flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every two ninja levels thereafter. Bonus damage from sneak attacks is precision damage. Should the ninja score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this precision damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, whip, or unarmed strike), a ninja can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The ninja must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot, and must be able to reach this spot. A ninja cannot sneak attack while striking a creature that has concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Undercover Faith (Ex): </b>At 1st level, when not wearing his mask, a mask of the Living God can take on an utterly mundane identity as if he were a vigilante with the many guises social talent. While in a mundane identity, the mask of the Living God cannot wear his mask; putting it on while in a mundane identity immediately ends the mundane identity and its effects. Changing into this mundane identity takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight to preserve the mask of the Living God&#146;s secret. The time it takes the mask of the Living God to change into a mundane identity cannot be decreased.</p>
			<p><b>Expurgate (Sp): </b>The role of a mask of the Living God is to silence heretics and blasphemers, and he is an expert at rendering even the most glib of his foes into babbling fools. At 2nd level, when he deals damage to a target, he can expend 1 point from his ki pool to affect that target as if he had cast fumbletongue, using his ninja level as his caster level. The target can attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half the ninja&#146;s level + his Charisma modifier) to negate this effect. At 6th level, the target of this ability is instead struck entirely mute for 1d4 rounds unless it succeeds at a Will saving throw. The mask of the Living God cannot spend a point from his ki pool to make an additional attack.</p>
			<p><b>Ki Pool (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a ninja gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy she can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in the ninja's ki pool is equal to 1/2 her ninja level + her Charisma modifier. As long as she has at least 1 point in her ki pool, she treats any Acrobatics skill check made to jump as if she had a running start. At 10th level, she also reduces the DC of Acrobatics skill checks made to jump by 1/2 (although she still cannot move farther than her speed allows).</p>
			<p>By spending 1 point from her ki pool, a ninja can make one additional attack at her highest attack bonus, but she can do so only when making a full attack. In addition, she can spend 1 point to increase her speed by 20 feet for 1 round. Finally, a ninja can spend 1 point from her ki pool to give herself a +4 insight bonus on Stealth checks for 1 round. Each of these powers is activated as a swift action. A ninja can gain additional powers that consume points from her ki pool by selecting certain ninja tricks.</p>
			<p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive. If the ninja possesses levels in another class that grants points to a ki pool, ninja levels stack with the levels of that class to determine the total number of ki points in the combined pool, but only one ability score modifier is added to the total. The choice of which score to use is made when the second class ability is gained, and once made, the choice is set. The ninja can now use ki points from this pool to power the abilities of every class she possesses that grants a ki pool.</p>
			<p><b>Ninja Tricks: </b>As a ninja continues her training, she learns a number of tricks that allow her to confuse her foes and grant her supernatural abilities. Starting at 2nd level, a ninja gains one ninja trick. She gains one additional ninja trick for every 2 levels attained after 2nd. Unless otherwise noted, a ninja cannot select an individual ninja trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Stern Gaze (Ex): </b>A mask of the Living God is trained to sense deception and strike fear into the hearts of his foes. At 3rd level, he gains a morale bonus equal to half his ninja level on Intimidate and Sense Motive checks.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>Starting at 4th level, a ninja can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A ninja with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
			<p>If a ninja already possesses uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead.</p>
			<p><b>Light Steps (Ex): </b>At 6th level, a ninja learns to move while barely touching the surface underneath her. As a full-round action, she can move up to twice her speed, ignoring difficult terrain. While moving in this way, any surface will support her, no matter how much she weighs. This allows her to move across water, lava, or even the thinnest tree branches. She must end her move on a surface that can support her normally. She cannot move across air in this way, nor can she walk up walls or other vertical surfaces. When moving in this way, she does not take damage from surfaces or hazards that react to being touched, such as lava or caltrops, nor does she need to make Acrobatics checks to avoid falling on slippery or rough surfaces. Finally, when using light steps, the ninja ignores any mechanical traps that use a location-based trigger.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a ninja can no longer be flanked. This defense denies another ninja (or rogue) the ability to sneak attack the ninja by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more ninja (or rogue) levels than the target does.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack when determining the minimum ninja (or rogue) level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Master Tricks: </b>At 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a ninja can select one of the following master tricks in place of a ninja trick.</p>
			<p><b>Hidden Master (Su): </b>At 20th level, a ninja becomes a true master of her art. She can, as a standard action, cast greater invisibility on herself. While invisible in this way, she cannot be detected by any means, and not even invisibility purge, see invisibility, and true seeing can reveal her. She uses her ninja level as her caster level for this ability. Using this ability consumes 3 ki points from her ki pool. In addition, whenever the ninja deals sneak attack damage, she can sacrifice additional damage dice to apply a penalty to one ability score of the target equal to the number of dice sacrificed for 1 minute. This penalty does not stack with itself and cannot reduce an ability score below 1.</p>

When moving in this way, she does not take damage from surfaces or hazards that react to being touched, such as lava or caltrops, nor does she need to make Acrobatics checks to avoid falling on slippery or rough surfaces. Finally, when using light steps, the ninja ignores any mechanical traps that use a location-based trigger.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The order dispatches specially trained killers to hunt relentlessly and fight from the shadows.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>When the wealthy and the powerful need an enemy eliminated quietly and without fail, they call upon the ninja. When a general needs to sabotage the siege engines of his foes before they can reach the castle walls, he calls upon the ninja. And when fools dare to move against a ninja or her companions, they will find the ninja waiting for them while they sleep, ready to strike. These shadowy killers are masters of infiltration, sabotage, and assassination, using a wide variety of weapons, practiced skills, and mystical powers to achieve their goals.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The ninja spends almost all of her time honing her skills, practicing her art, or working on her next assignment. Even when not specifically working, the ninja is ever vigilant and ready for the situation to turn deadly. Her line of work earns her many enemies, but it is a list that she frequently reduces through assassination and misdirection. The ninja is an alternate class for the rogue core class.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ninja's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>8 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Ninja are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the kama, katana, kusarigama, nunchaku, sai, shortbow, short sword, shuriken, siangham, and wakizashi. They are proficient with light armor but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Use: </b>At 1st level, a ninja is trained in the use of poison and cannot accidentally poison herself when applying poison to a weapon.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a ninja can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The ninja's attacks deal extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the ninja flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every two ninja levels thereafter. Bonus damage from sneak attacks is precision damage. Should the ninja score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this precision damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, whip, or unarmed strike), a ninja can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The ninja must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot, and must be able to reach this spot. A ninja cannot sneak attack while striking a creature that has concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Ki Pool (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a ninja gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy she can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in the ninja's ki pool is equal to 1/2 her ninja level + her Charisma modifier. As long as she has at least 1 point in her ki pool, she treats any Acrobatics skill check made to jump as if she had a running start. At 10th level, she also reduces the DC of Acrobatics skill checks made to jump by 1/2 (although she still cannot move farther than her speed allows).</p>
			<p>By spending 1 point from her ki pool, a ninja can make one additional attack at her highest attack bonus, but she can do so only when making a full attack. In addition, she can spend 1 point to increase her speed by 20 feet for 1 round. Finally, a ninja can spend 1 point from her ki pool to give herself a +4 insight bonus on Stealth checks for 1 round. Each of these powers is activated as a swift action. A ninja can gain additional powers that consume points from her ki pool by selecting certain ninja tricks.</p>
			<p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive. If the ninja possesses levels in another class that grants points to a ki pool, ninja levels stack with the levels of that class to determine the total number of ki points in the combined pool, but only one ability score modifier is added to the total. The choice of which score to use is made when the second class ability is gained, and once made, the choice is set. The ninja can now use ki points from this pool to power the abilities of every class she possesses that grants a ki pool.</p>
			<p><b>Ninja Tricks: </b>As a ninja continues her training, she learns a number of tricks that allow her to confuse her foes and grant her supernatural abilities. Starting at 2nd level, a ninja gains one ninja trick. She gains one additional ninja trick for every 2 levels attained after 2nd. Unless otherwise noted, a ninja cannot select an individual ninja trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Relentless Pursuit (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a hunting serpent gains a +1 bonus on Diplomacy checks to gather information and on Survival checks to identify or follow tracks. The bonus increases by 1 for every 3 ninja levels beyond 3rd.</p>
			<p><b>Death Mark (Ex): </b>At 4th level, as a swift action once per day, a hunting serpent can mark an opponent damaged by her sneak attack for death. A hunting serpent gains a +1 competence bonus on attack and damage rolls against an opponent affected by death mark as well as on Survival checks to track the marked creature. The bonuses from death mark and its number of uses per day increase by 1 at 8th, 12th, and 16th levels. The effects of death mark last for 24 hours, until the marked creature is slain, or until the hunting serpent chooses to mark another creature, whichever comes first.</p>
			<p><b>Light Steps (Ex): </b>At 6th level, a ninja learns to move while barely touching the surface underneath her. As a full-round action, she can move up to twice her speed, ignoring difficult terrain. While moving in this way, any surface will support her, no matter how much she weighs. This allows her to move across water, lava, or even the thinnest tree branches. She must end her move on a surface that can support her normally. She cannot move across air in this way, nor can she walk up walls or other vertical surfaces. When moving in this way, she does not take damage from surfaces or hazards that react to being touched, such as lava or caltrops, nor does she need to make Acrobatics checks to avoid falling on slippery or rough surfaces. Finally, when using light steps, the ninja ignores any mechanical traps that use a location-based trigger.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack when determining the minimum ninja (or rogue) level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Certain Demise (Ex): </b>At 10th level, the hunting serpent&#146;s sneak attack damage applies on the first attack she makes each round against the target of her death mark ability, even if it normally wouldn&#146;t. Other effects that trigger on a sneak attack do not apply with this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Master Tricks: </b>At 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a ninja can select one of the following master tricks in place of a ninja trick.</p>
			<p><b>Hidden Master (Su): </b>At 20th level, a ninja becomes a true master of her art. She can, as a standard action, cast greater invisibility on herself. While invisible in this way, she cannot be detected by any means, and not even invisibility purge, see invisibility, and true seeing can reveal her. She uses her ninja level as her caster level for this ability. Using this ability consumes 3 ki points from her ki pool. In addition, whenever the ninja deals sneak attack damage, she can sacrifice additional damage dice to apply a penalty to one ability score of the target equal to the number of dice sacrificed for 1 minute. This penalty does not stack with itself and cannot reduce an ability score below 1.</p>

As long as she has at least 1 point in her ki pool, she treats any Acrobatics skill check made to jump as if she had a running start. At 10th level, she also reduces the DC of Acrobatics skill checks made to jump by 1/2 (although she still cannot move farther than her speed allows).</p>
					<p>By spending 1 point from her ki pool, a ninja can make one additional attack at her highest attack bonus, but she can do so only when making a full attack. In addition, she can spend 1 point to increase her speed by 20 feet for 1 round. Finally, a ninja can spend 1 point from her ki pool to give herself a +4 insight bonus on Stealth checks for 1 round. Each of these powers is activated as a swift action. A ninja can gain additional powers that consume points from her ki pool by selecting certain ninja tricks.</p>
					<p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive. If the ninja possesses levels in another class that grants points to a ki pool, ninja levels stack with the levels of that class to determine the total number of ki points in the combined pool, but only one ability score modifier is added to the total. The choice of which score to use is made when the second class ability is gained, and once made, the choice is set. The ninja can now use ki points from this pool to power the abilities of every class she possesses that grants a ki pool.</p>

					<p>At 2nd level, a gunpowder bombardier can expend 1 ki point to throw a gunpowder bomb at a grid intersection as a ranged attack against AC 5 with a range of 20 feet. The gunpowder bomb deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage to all creatures in a 10-footradius burst, which can be increased to 20 feet by spending 1 additional ki point. A creature in the bomb&#146;s radius can attempt a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half the gunpowder bombardier&#146;s ninja level + her Dexterity modifier) for half damage. At 5th level and every 2 levels thereafter, the bomb&#146;s damage increases by 1d6, to a maximum of 9d6 points of bludgeoning damage at 19th level.</p>

					<p>At 6th level, a ninja learns to move while barely touching the surface underneath her. As a full-round action, she can move up to twice her speed, ignoring difficult terrain. While moving in this way, any surface will support her, no matter how much she weighs. This allows her to move across water, lava, or even the thinnest tree branches. She must end her move on a surface that can support her normally. She cannot move across air in this way, nor can she walk up walls or other vertical surfaces. When moving in this way, she does not take damage from surfaces or hazards that react to being touched, such as lava or caltrops, nor does she need to make Acrobatics checks to avoid falling on slippery or rough surfaces. Finally, when using light steps, the ninja ignores any mechanical traps that use a location-based trigger.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Ratfolk assassins and other ninjas with an affinity for gunpowder demonstrate masterful control of bombs, using the explosives to inflict major damage or impair their foes.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>When the wealthy and the powerful need an enemy eliminated quietly and without fail, they call upon the ninja. When a general needs to sabotage the siege engines of his foes before they can reach the castle walls, he calls upon the ninja. And when fools dare to move against a ninja or her companions, they will find the ninja waiting for them while they sleep, ready to strike. These shadowy killers are masters of infiltration, sabotage, and assassination, using a wide variety of weapons, practiced skills, and mystical powers to achieve their goals.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The ninja spends almost all of her time honing her skills, practicing her art, or working on her next assignment. Even when not specifically working, the ninja is ever vigilant and ready for the situation to turn deadly. Her line of work earns her many enemies, but it is a list that she frequently reduces through assassination and misdirection. The ninja is an alternate class for the rogue core class.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ninja's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>8 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Ninja are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the kama, katana, kusarigama, nunchaku, sai, shortbow, short sword, shuriken, siangham, and wakizashi. They are proficient with light armor but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Use: </b>At 1st level, a ninja is trained in the use of poison and cannot accidentally poison herself when applying poison to a weapon.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a ninja can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The ninja's attacks deal extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the ninja flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every two ninja levels thereafter. Bonus damage from sneak attacks is precision damage. Should the ninja score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this precision damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, whip, or unarmed strike), a ninja can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The ninja must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot, and must be able to reach this spot. A ninja cannot sneak attack while striking a creature that has concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Gunpowder Bomb (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a gunpowder bombardier can expend 1 ki point to throw a gunpowder bomb at a grid intersection as a ranged attack against AC 5 with a range of 20 feet. The gunpowder bomb deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage to all creatures in a 10-footradius burst, which can be increased to 20 feet by spending 1 additional ki point. A creature in the bomb&#146;s radius can attempt a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half the gunpowder bombardier&#146;s ninja level + her Dexterity modifier) for half damage. At 5th level and every 2 levels thereafter, the bomb&#146;s damage increases by 1d6, to a maximum of 9d6 points of bludgeoning damage at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Ki Pool (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a ninja gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy she can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in the ninja's ki pool is equal to 1/2 her ninja level + her Charisma modifier. As long as she has at least 1 point in her ki pool, she treats any Acrobatics skill check made to jump as if she had a running start. At 10th level, she also reduces the DC of Acrobatics skill checks made to jump by 1/2 (although she still cannot move farther than her speed allows).</p>
			<p>By spending 1 point from her ki pool, a ninja can make one additional attack at her highest attack bonus, but she can do so only when making a full attack. In addition, she can spend 1 point to increase her speed by 20 feet for 1 round. Finally, a ninja can spend 1 point from her ki pool to give herself a +4 insight bonus on Stealth checks for 1 round. Each of these powers is activated as a swift action. A ninja can gain additional powers that consume points from her ki pool by selecting certain ninja tricks.</p>
			<p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive. If the ninja possesses levels in another class that grants points to a ki pool, ninja levels stack with the levels of that class to determine the total number of ki points in the combined pool, but only one ability score modifier is added to the total. The choice of which score to use is made when the second class ability is gained, and once made, the choice is set. The ninja can now use ki points from this pool to power the abilities of every class she possesses that grants a ki pool.</p>
			<p><b>Ninja Tricks: </b>As a ninja continues her training, she learns a number of tricks that allow her to confuse her foes and grant her supernatural abilities. Starting at 2nd level, a ninja gains one ninja trick. She gains one additional ninja trick for every 2 levels attained after 2nd. Unless otherwise noted, a ninja cannot select an individual ninja trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>No Trace (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ninja learns to cover her tracks, remain hidden, and conceal her presence. The DC to track a ninja using the Survival skill increases by +1. In addition, her training gives her a +1 insight bonus on Disguise skill checks and on opposed Stealth checks whenever she is stationary and does not take any action for at least 1 round. Every three levels thereafter, the increase to Survival DCs and the bonuses on Disguise and opposed Stealth checks increase by 1.</p>
			<p><b>Explosive Impairment (Su): </b>At 4th level, a gunpowder bombardier can imbue her gunpowder bombs with impairing effects. By spending 1 additional ki point when she throws a gunpowder bomb, the gunpowder bombardier can cause her bomb to inflict one of the following conditions, in addition to dealing its normal damage, for a number of rounds equal to half her ninja level: dazzled, deafened, entangled, or shaken. At 8th level, she adds nauseated and stunned to the list of conditions her bombs can inflict. A creature that succeeds at the Reflex save to halve the damage also negates the condition inflicted by the gunpowder bomb.</p>
			<p><b>Light Steps (Ex): </b>At 6th level, a ninja learns to move while barely touching the surface underneath her. As a full-round action, she can move up to twice her speed, ignoring difficult terrain. While moving in this way, any surface will support her, no matter how much she weighs. This allows her to move across water, lava, or even the thinnest tree branches. She must end her move on a surface that can support her normally. She cannot move across air in this way, nor can she walk up walls or other vertical surfaces. When moving in this way, she does not take damage from surfaces or hazards that react to being touched, such as lava or caltrops, nor does she need to make Acrobatics checks to avoid falling on slippery or rough surfaces. Finally, when using light steps, the ninja ignores any mechanical traps that use a location-based trigger.</p>
			<p><b>Delayed Explosive (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a gunpowder bombardier can plant a gunpowder bomb and delay its explosion. As a standard action, the gunpowder bombardier can place a gunpowder bomb&#151;adding effects as she would if she were throwing the gunpowder bomb, and spending the requisite ki points&#151;and specify a number of rounds after which the bomb will detonate, up to a maximum number of rounds equal to the gunpowder bombardier&#146;s ninja level. If the bomb is touched or moved by another creature, it detonates immediately. The gunpowder bombardier can have only one delayed explosive active at a time; planting another gunpowder bomb renders the previous bomb inert.</p>
			<p><b>Master Tricks: </b>At 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a ninja can select one of the following master tricks in place of a ninja trick.</p>
			<p><b>Hidden Master (Su): </b>At 20th level, a ninja becomes a true master of her art. She can, as a standard action, cast greater invisibility on herself. While invisible in this way, she cannot be detected by any means, and not even invisibility purge, see invisibility, and true seeing can reveal her. She uses her ninja level as her caster level for this ability. Using this ability consumes 3 ki points from her ki pool. In addition, whenever the ninja deals sneak attack damage, she can sacrifice additional damage dice to apply a penalty to one ability score of the target equal to the number of dice sacrificed for 1 minute. This penalty does not stack with itself and cannot reduce an ability score below 1.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Frozen shadows belong to a rare ninja clan operating in Avistan, having migrated to the Lands of the Linnorm Kings decades ago. Most members are Tian, Ulfen, and Varki humans, and they work as thieves, power brokers, and spies loosely guided by secretive masters with unknown agendas.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>When the wealthy and the powerful need an enemy eliminated quietly and without fail, they call upon the ninja. When a general needs to sabotage the siege engines of his foes before they can reach the castle walls, he calls upon the ninja. And when fools dare to move against a ninja or her companions, they will find the ninja waiting for them while they sleep, ready to strike. These shadowy killers are masters of infiltration, sabotage, and assassination, using a wide variety of weapons, practiced skills, and mystical powers to achieve their goals.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The ninja spends almost all of her time honing her skills, practicing her art, or working on her next assignment. Even when not specifically working, the ninja is ever vigilant and ready for the situation to turn deadly. Her line of work earns her many enemies, but it is a list that she frequently reduces through assassination and misdirection. The ninja is an alternate class for the rogue core class.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Ninja's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>8 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Ninja are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the kama, katana, kusarigama, nunchaku, sai, shortbow, short sword, shuriken, siangham, and wakizashi. They are proficient with light armor but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Use: </b>At 1st level, a ninja is trained in the use of poison and cannot accidentally poison herself when applying poison to a weapon.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>If a ninja can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p>
			<p>The ninja's attacks deal extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the ninja flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every two ninja levels thereafter. Bonus damage from sneak attacks is precision damage. Should the ninja score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this precision damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, whip, or unarmed strike), a ninja can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The ninja must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot, and must be able to reach this spot. A ninja cannot sneak attack while striking a creature that has concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Hardy Killer (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a frozen shadow has become incredibly inured to his surrounding climate. At the beginning of any day, the frozen shadow can spend 1 point from his ki pool to benefit from the effects of an endure elements spell. The frozen shadow does not treat any Acrobatics skill check to jump as if he had a running start, and at 10th level he cannot reduce the DC of Acrobatics skill checks made to jump by half.</p>
			<p><b>Ki Pool (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a ninja gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy she can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in the ninja's ki pool is equal to 1/2 her ninja level + her Charisma modifier. As long as she has at least 1 point in her ki pool, she treats any Acrobatics skill check made to jump as if she had a running start. At 10th level, she also reduces the DC of Acrobatics skill checks made to jump by 1/2 (although she still cannot move farther than her speed allows).</p>
			<p>By spending 1 point from her ki pool, a ninja can make one additional attack at her highest attack bonus, but she can do so only when making a full attack. In addition, she can spend 1 point to increase her speed by 20 feet for 1 round. Finally, a ninja can spend 1 point from her ki pool to give herself a +4 insight bonus on Stealth checks for 1 round. Each of these powers is activated as a swift action. A ninja can gain additional powers that consume points from her ki pool by selecting certain ninja tricks.</p>
			<p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive. If the ninja possesses levels in another class that grants points to a ki pool, ninja levels stack with the levels of that class to determine the total number of ki points in the combined pool, but only one ability score modifier is added to the total. The choice of which score to use is made when the second class ability is gained, and once made, the choice is set. The ninja can now use ki points from this pool to power the abilities of every class she possesses that grants a ki pool.</p>
			<p><b>Ninja Tricks: </b>As a ninja continues her training, she learns a number of tricks that allow her to confuse her foes and grant her supernatural abilities. Starting at 2nd level, a ninja gains one ninja trick. She gains one additional ninja trick for every 2 levels attained after 2nd. Unless otherwise noted, a ninja cannot select an individual ninja trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>No Trace (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a ninja learns to cover her tracks, remain hidden, and conceal her presence. The DC to track a ninja using the Survival skill increases by +1. In addition, her training gives her a +1 insight bonus on Disguise skill checks and on opposed Stealth checks whenever she is stationary and does not take any action for at least 1 round. Every three levels thereafter, the increase to Survival DCs and the bonuses on Disguise and opposed Stealth checks increase by 1.</p>
			<p><b>Track Victim (Ex): </b>Starting at 4th level, a frozen shadow adds half his ninja level on Survival checks to follow tracks and on Perception checks to see through disguises. Additionally, if the frozen shadow sees a creature that has changed its appearance using the Disguise skill, he can always attempt a Perception check to see through the disguise, even if the disguised creature did nothing to draw attention to itself. The frozen shadow also gains a +2 bonus to Will saving throws when attempting to disbelieve an illusion affecting a creature or creatures.</p>
			<p><b>Light Steps (Ex): </b>At 6th level, a ninja learns to move while barely touching the surface underneath her. As a full-round action, she can move up to twice her speed, ignoring difficult terrain. While moving in this way, any surface will support her, no matter how much she weighs. This allows her to move across water, lava, or even the thinnest tree branches. She must end her move on a surface that can support her normally. She cannot move across air in this way, nor can she walk up walls or other vertical surfaces. When moving in this way, she does not take damage from surfaces or hazards that react to being touched, such as lava or caltrops, nor does she need to make Acrobatics checks to avoid falling on slippery or rough surfaces. Finally, when using light steps, the ninja ignores any mechanical traps that use a location-based trigger.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a frozen shadow can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. He takes only a &#150;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#150;20) when moving up to twice his normal speed while tracking. Additionally, his bonus on Will saving throws to disbelieve illusions affecting a creature or creatures increases to +4.</p>
			<p><b>Master Tricks: </b>At 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a ninja can select one of the following master tricks in place of a ninja trick.</p>
			<p><b>Hidden Master (Su): </b>At 20th level, a ninja becomes a true master of her art. She can, as a standard action, cast greater invisibility on herself. While invisible in this way, she cannot be detected by any means, and not even invisibility purge, see invisibility, and true seeing can reveal her.
