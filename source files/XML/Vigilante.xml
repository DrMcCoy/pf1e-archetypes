				<name type="string">Dual Identity</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante&#146;s true identity revealed to the world at large.</p>
					<p>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante&#146;s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user&#146;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p>
					<p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante&#146;s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#146;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante&#146;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>
					<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>

					<p>A vigilante knows how to behave in a way that appears perfectly proper and normal for his current identity. Should anyone suspect him of being anything other than what he appears to be while either in his social or vigilante identity, he can attempt a Disguise check with a +20 circumstance bonus to appear as his current identity, and not as his other identity.</p>

				<name type="string">Vigilante Specialization</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a vigilante must choose to be either an avenger or a stalker.</p>
					<p>An avenger gains a base attack bonus equal to his vigilante level instead of using those listed on Table 1&#150;1. He adds this value to any other base attack bonus gained from other classes or racial Hit Dice as normal.</p>
					<p>A stalker gains an ability called hidden strike, which allows him to deal an extra 1d8 points of precision damage on melee attacks (or ranged attacks from within 30 feet) against foes who are unaware of his presence, who consider him an ally, or who are made flat-footed by startling appearance (see page 17). This extra damage increases by 1d8 at 3rd level and every 2 vigilante levels thereafter. A stalker vigilante can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that he is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage dice are reduced to d4s. A stalker can deal hidden strike damage against targets with concealment (but not total concealment).</p>
					<p>Once this choice is made, it can&#146;t be changed. While many vigilante talents are usable by both specializations, some are unique to each specialization. A stalker vigilante can apply only one talent marked with an asterisk (*) to a given hidden strike, and only when that hidden strike is dealt against a foe that is unaware of the stalker vigilante&#146;s presence (or who considers him an ally), unless otherwise noted.</p>

					<p>At 5th level, a vigilante learns to use the element of surprise to his advantage, startling foes that are unaware of his presence. Whenever a vigilante with this ability attempts an attack against a foe that is completely unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (usually due to Stealth or invisibility), the foe is treated as flat-footed for the rest of the vigilante&#146;s turn (uncanny dodge or a similar ability prevents this effect unless the vigilante is at least 4 levels higher than the foe with uncanny dodge).

					<p>At 11th level, whenever a vigilante with this ability makes an attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance above), the vigilante can, as a free action, attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of his attack and any enemies within 10 feet who can see the attack. This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets. If the check succeeds against the target of the vigilante&#146;s attack, that foe is also frightened for 1 round, in addition to being shaken as normal, unless the foe succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier).</p>
					<p>Once a creature has been the target of this ability (either as the target of the attack or as a nearby creature, regardless of whether or not it was successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s frightening appearance for 24 hours.

If the creature has more HD than the vigilante&#146;s class level, it receives a +4 circumstance bonus on this save.

					<p>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>-</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Life can be unfair. Think of the starving peasants forced to toil for the local baron or the common laborers tasked with building the king&#146;s newest palace for a mere handful of copper pieces each week. There are those who see these injustices and do nothing. There are those who are willing to reap the rewards obtained through the suffering of others. Then there are those who see inequality and find themselves driven to take action, outside the law if necessary. These vigilantes operate in plain sight, hiding behind respectable personas by day, but donning alternate guises by night to right the wrongs they see all around them.</p>
			<p>Not all vigilantes are out to make the world a better place. Some criminals hide behind the pretense of being ordinary folk, only to become terrors in the shadows, stealing and killing to fulfill some dark agenda. In either case, the vigilante is a character of two natures&#151;the face that everyone knows and the mask that inspires fear.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A vigilante can take on many tasks within a group. Most are skilled at negotiating delicate social situations and courtly intrigue, but they can also serve as stealthy spies or even brutish warriors in dangerous environments.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>

			<h>Class Abilities</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Vigilantes are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Dual Identity (Ex): </b>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante&#146;s true identity revealed to the world at large.</p>
			<p>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante&#146;s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user&#146;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p>
			<p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante&#146;s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#146;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante&#146;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>
			<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>
			<p><b>Seamless Guise (Ex) </b>: A vigilante knows how to behave in a way that appears perfectly proper and normal for his current identity. Should anyone suspect him of being anything other than what he appears to be while either in his social or vigilante identity, he can attempt a Disguise check with a +20 circumstance bonus to appear as his current identity, and not as his other identity.</p>
			<p><b>Social Talent: </b>Starting at 1st level, and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a social talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet other prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as having another social talent or attaining a minimum vigilante level. Once a talent has been chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Specialization (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a vigilante must choose to be either an avenger or a stalker.</p>
			<p>An avenger gains a base attack bonus equal to his vigilante level instead of using those listed on Table 1&#150;1. He adds this value to any other base attack bonus gained from other classes or racial Hit Dice as normal.</p>
			<p>A stalker gains an ability called hidden strike, which allows him to deal an extra 1d8 points of precision damage on melee attacks (or ranged attacks from within 30 feet) against foes who are unaware of his presence, who consider him an ally, or who are made flat-footed by startling appearance (see page 17). This extra damage increases by 1d8 at 3rd level and every 2 vigilante levels thereafter. A stalker vigilante can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that he is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage dice are reduced to d4s. A stalker can deal hidden strike damage against targets with concealment (but not total concealment).</p>
			<p>Once this choice is made, it can&#146;t be changed. While many vigilante talents are usable by both specializations, some are unique to each specialization. A stalker vigilante can apply only one talent marked with an asterisk (*) to a given hidden strike, and only when that hidden strike is dealt against a foe that is unaware of the stalker vigilante&#146;s presence (or who considers him an ally), unless otherwise noted.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Talent: </b>Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a vigilante talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as possessing another vigilante talent, possessing a particular specialization, or attaining a minimum level. Once a talent has been selected, it can&#146;t be changed.</p>
			<p>If the vigilante uses any of these talents while in his social identity, he must succeed at a Disguise check against the Perception checks of all onlookers (without the +20 circumstance bonus from seamless guise) or the onlookers will realize that he is more than his social identity appears to be and perhaps discover the social and vigilante identities are one and the same. If a talent calls for a saving throw, the DC for that save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s level + the vigilante&#146;s Charisma modifier, unless stated otherwise.</p>
			<p><b>Unshakable (Ex): </b>Starting at 3rd level, a vigilante adds his class level to the DC of any attempts to Intimidate him.</p>
			<p><b>Startling Appearance (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a vigilante learns to use the element of surprise to his advantage, startling foes that are unaware of his presence. Whenever a vigilante with this ability attempts an attack against a foe that is completely unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (usually due to Stealth or invisibility), the foe is treated as flat-footed for the rest of the vigilante&#146;s turn (uncanny dodge or a similar ability prevents this effect unless the vigilante is at least 4 levels higher than the foe with uncanny dodge). The foe also takes a &#150;4 penalty on attacks made against the vigilante until the start of the vigilante&#146;s next turn.</p>
			<p><b>Frightening Appearance (Ex): </b>At 11th level, whenever a vigilante with this ability makes an attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance above), the vigilante can, as a free action, attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of his attack and any enemies within 10 feet who can see the attack. This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets. If the check succeeds against the target of the vigilante&#146;s attack, that foe is also frightened for 1 round, in addition to being shaken as normal, unless the foe succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier).</p>
			<p>Once a creature has been the target of this ability (either as the target of the attack or as a nearby creature, regardless of whether or not it was successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s frightening appearance for 24 hours. This effect is in addition to the bonuses gained from the startling appearance ability. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Stunning Appearance (Ex) </b>: At 17th level, a vigilante can leave his foes unable to respond when he appears. Whenever a vigilante with this ability makes a successful attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance), the foe must make a successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier) or be stunned until the end of the vigilante&#146;s next turn. If the creature has more HD than the vigilante&#146;s class level, it receives a +4 circumstance bonus on this save. This ability is in addition to the effects of startling appearance and frightening appearance. Once a creature has been the target of this ability (regardless of whether or not the saving throw is successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s stunning appearance for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Vengeance Strike (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 5th level, a vigilante learns to use the element of surprise to his advantage, startling foes that are unaware of his presence. Whenever a vigilante with this ability attempts an attack against a foe that is completely unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (usually due to Stealth or invisibility), the foe is treated as flat-footed for the rest of the vigilante&#146;s turn (uncanny dodge or a similar ability prevents this effect unless the vigilante is at least 4 levels higher than the foe with uncanny dodge). The foe also takes a &#150;4 penalty on attacks made against the vigilante until the start of the vigilante&#146;s next turn.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 11th level, whenever a vigilante with this ability makes an attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance above), the vigilante can, as a free action, attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of his attack and any enemies within 10 feet who can see the attack. This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets. If the check succeeds against the target of the vigilante&#146;s attack, that foe is also frightened for 1 round, in addition to being shaken as normal, unless the foe succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier).</p>
					<p>Once a creature has been the target of this ability (either as the target of the attack or as a nearby creature, regardless of whether or not it was successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s frightening appearance for 24 hours. This effect is in addition to the bonuses gained from the startling appearance ability. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>

If the creature has more HD than the vigilante&#146;s class level, it receives a +4 circumstance bonus on this save.

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>

				<name type="string">Zealot Talents</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A zealot can select from any of the following vigilante talents, in addition to general vigilante talents. This alters vigilante talents.</p>
					<p>Channel Energy (Su): A zealot who takes this talent can channel energy with an effective cleric level equal to his vigilante level &#150; 4 (minimum 1) while in his vigilante identity. If good in his vigilante identity (or if he worships a good deity), the vigilante channels positive energy and can choose to deal damage to undead creatures or to heal living creatures. If evil in his vigilante identity (or if he worships an evil deity), the vigilante channels negative energy and can choose to deal damage to living creatures or to heal undead creatures. If the vigilante is neutral in his vigilante identity and worships a neutral deity, the vigilante must choose whether he channels positive or negative energy. Once this choice is made, it can&#146;t be reversed.</p>
					<p>Discern Lies (Sp): The zealot can use discern lies as a spell-like ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his vigilante level. The rounds need not be consecutive. Activating this ability is an immediate action. A zealot must be 6th level before taking this talent.</p>
					<p>Empower Symbol (Su): As a standard action, the zealot can empower his holy symbol. If the zealot is of good alignment while in his vigilante identity (or worships a good deity), this works as if the holy symbol was the center of a consecrate effect. If the zealot is of evil alignment in his vigilante identity (or worships an evil deity), this works as if the holy symbol was the center of a desecrate effect. If the zealot is neutral in his vigilante identity and worships a neutral deity, he can choose whether this ability acts as per consecrate or desecrate, but once the choice is made, it cannot be changed. At 10th level, the zealot treats his holy symbol as a permanent fixture for the purpose of determining the consecration or desecration effects. A zealot must be at least 6th level to select this talent.</p>
					<p>Stalwart (Ex): A zealot with this talent can use mental and physical resilience to avoid certain attacks. If he succeeds at a Fortitude or Will saving throw against an attack that has a reduced effect on a successful save, he avoids the effect entirely. A helpless zealot doesn&#146;t gain the benefit of this ability. A zealot must be 12th level before selecting this talent.</p>
					<p>Stern Gaze (Ex): A zealot with this talent is skilled at sensing deception and intimidating his foes. The zealot gains a morale bonus on all Intimidate and Sense Motive checks equal to half his vigilante level (minimum +1).</p>
					<p>Zealot Smite (Su): Once per day, a zealot with this talent can use this power to smite a foe. Zealots that are good in their vigilante identity (or worship a good deity) can smite evil creatures, those that are evil in their vigilante identity (or worship an evil deity) can smite good creatures, those that are chaotic in their vigilante identity (or worship a chaotic deity) can smite lawful creatures, and those that are lawful in their vigilante identity (or worship a lawful deity) can smite chaotic creatures. A zealot that is neutral when in his vigilante identity and that worships a neutral deity can pick to smite any one of the four alignments; other zealots must select from the alignments available based on their own alignment or their deity&#146;s. Once that choice is made, it can&#146;t be changed.</p>
					<p>As a swift action, the zealot chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is of the proper alignment, the zealot adds his Charisma bonus on his attack rolls (to a maximum of half his vigilante level) and his vigilante level on all damage rolls against the target of his smite. If the target of smite is an outsider with an alignment subtype of the zealot&#146;s smite, a similarly aligned dragon, or an undead creature (if the zealot&#146;s smite is against evil creatures), a good-aligned cleric or paladin (if the zealot&#146;s smite is against good creatures), a chaotic aberration (if the zealot&#146;s smite is against chaotic creatures), or a lawful-aligned cleric or paladin (if the zealot&#146;s smite is against lawful creatures), the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per vigilante level. Regardless of the target, the zealot&#146;s smite attacks bypass the creature&#146;s DR as if it were a weapon with a +5 enhancement bonus.</p>
					<p>At 5th level, and every 3 vigilante levels thereafter, a zealot can smite one additional time per day, to a maximum of seven times per day at 20th level.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Dedicated to a single deity, the zealot hunts the enemies of his faith in secret, often because his religion is outlawed or persecuted in the region.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Life can be unfair. Think of the starving peasants forced to toil for the local baron or the common laborers tasked with building the king&#146;s newest palace for a mere handful of copper pieces each week. There are those who see these injustices and do nothing. There are those who are willing to reap the rewards obtained through the suffering of others. Then there are those who see inequality and find themselves driven to take action, outside the law if necessary. These vigilantes operate in plain sight, hiding behind respectable personas by day, but donning alternate guises by night to right the wrongs they see all around them.</p>
			<p>Not all vigilantes are out to make the world a better place. Some criminals hide behind the pretense of being ordinary folk, only to become terrors in the shadows, stealing and killing to fulfill some dark agenda. In either case, the vigilante is a character of two natures&#151;the face that everyone knows and the mask that inspires fear.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A vigilante can take on many tasks within a group. Most are skilled at negotiating delicate social situations and courtly intrigue, but they can also serve as stealthy spies or even brutish warriors in dangerous environments.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>A zealot&#146;s alignment must be within one step of his deity&#146;s, along either the law/chaos axis or the good/evil axis, but only when in his vigilante identity. If his social identity&#146;s alignment isn&#146;t within one step of his deity&#146;s, he can&#146;t cast spells in his social identity.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Vigilante's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Abilities</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Vigilantes are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A zealot is also proficient in his deity&#146;s favored weapon, even if it is an exotic weapon, and if the deity&#146;s favored weapon is unarmed strike, he gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Aura (Ex): </b>A zealot of a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful deity has a particularly powerful aura corresponding to the deity&#146;s alignment (see detect evil spell for details), but only when in his vigilante identity.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells: </b>Zealots can&#146;t cast spells of an alignment opposed to his vigilante identity&#146;s alignment or that of his deity. Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaotic, evil, good, and lawful descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Dual Identity (Ex): </b>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante&#146;s true identity revealed to the world at large.</p>
			<p>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante&#146;s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user&#146;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p>
			<p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante&#146;s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#146;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante&#146;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>
			<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>
			<p>Seamless Guise (Ex): A vigilante knows how to behave in a way that appears perfectly proper and normal for his current identity. Should anyone suspect him of being anything other than what he appears to be while either in his social or vigilante identity, he can attempt a Disguise check with a +20 circumstance bonus to appear as his current identity, and not as his other identity.</p>
			<p><b>Inquisition (Ex): </b>A zealot picks a deity and picks a single inquisition (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 41) tied to that deity. He uses his vigilante level as his inquisitor level to determine level dependent inquisition abilities.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces vigilante specialization.</p>
			<p><b>Social Talent: </b>Starting at 1st level, and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a social talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet other prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as having another social talent or attaining a minimum vigilante level. Once a talent has been chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Spellcasting: </b>A zealot casts divine spells and orisons as an inquisitor and uses the inquisitor&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p>This replaces the 4th-, 8th-, 10th-, 14th-, and 16th-level vigilante talents.</p>
			<p><b>Zealot Talents: </b>A zealot can select from any of the following vigilante talents, in addition to general vigilante talents. This alters vigilante talents.</p>
			<p><i>Channel Energy (Su): </i>A zealot who takes this talent can channel energy with an effective cleric level equal to his vigilante level &#150; 4 (minimum 1) while in his vigilante identity. If good in his vigilante identity (or if he worships a good deity), the vigilante channels positive energy and can choose to deal damage to undead creatures or to heal living creatures. If evil in his vigilante identity (or if he worships an evil deity), the vigilante channels negative energy and can choose to deal damage to living creatures or to heal undead creatures. If the vigilante is neutral in his vigilante identity and worships a neutral deity, the vigilante must choose whether he channels positive or negative energy. Once this choice is made, it can&#146;t be reversed.</p>
			<p><i>Discern Lies (Sp): </i>The zealot can use discern lies as a spell-like ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his vigilante level. The rounds need not be consecutive. Activating this ability is an immediate action. A zealot must be 6th level before taking this talent.</p>
			<p><i>Empower Symbol (Su): </i>As a standard action, the zealot can empower his holy symbol. If the zealot is of good alignment while in his vigilante identity (or worships a good deity), this works as if the holy symbol was the center of a consecrate effect. If the zealot is of evil alignment in his vigilante identity (or worships an evil deity), this works as if the holy symbol was the center of a desecrate effect. If the zealot is neutral in his vigilante identity and worships a neutral deity, he can choose whether this ability acts as per consecrate or desecrate, but once the choice is made, it cannot be changed. At 10th level, the zealot treats his holy symbol as a permanent fixture for the purpose of determining the consecration or desecration effects. A zealot must be at least 6th level to select this talent.</p>
			<p><i>Stalwart (Ex): </i>A zealot with this talent can use mental and physical resilience to avoid certain attacks. If he succeeds at a Fortitude or Will saving throw against an attack that has a reduced effect on a successful save, he avoids the effect entirely. A helpless zealot doesn&#146;t gain the benefit of this ability. A zealot must be 12th level before selecting this talent.</p>
			<p><i>Stern Gaze (Ex): </i>A zealot with this talent is skilled at sensing deception and intimidating his foes. The zealot gains a morale bonus on all Intimidate and Sense Motive checks equal to half his vigilante level (minimum +1).</p>
			<p><i>Zealot Smite (Su): </i>Once per day, a zealot with this talent can use this power to smite a foe. Zealots that are good in their vigilante identity (or worship a good deity) can smite evil creatures, those that are evil in their vigilante identity (or worship an evil deity) can smite good creatures, those that are chaotic in their vigilante identity (or worship a chaotic deity) can smite lawful creatures, and those that are lawful in their vigilante identity (or worship a lawful deity) can smite chaotic creatures. A zealot that is neutral when in his vigilante identity and that worships a neutral deity can pick to smite any one of the four alignments; other zealots must select from the alignments available based on their own alignment or their deity&#146;s. Once that choice is made, it can&#146;t be changed.</p>
			<p>As a swift action, the zealot chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is of the proper alignment, the zealot adds his Charisma bonus on his attack rolls (to a maximum of half his vigilante level) and his vigilante level on all damage rolls against the target of his smite. If the target of smite is an outsider with an alignment subtype of the zealot&#146;s smite, a similarly aligned dragon, or an undead creature (if the zealot&#146;s smite is against evil creatures), a good-aligned cleric or paladin (if the zealot&#146;s smite is against good creatures), a chaotic aberration (if the zealot&#146;s smite is against chaotic creatures), or a lawful-aligned cleric or paladin (if the zealot&#146;s smite is against lawful creatures), the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per vigilante level. Regardless of the target, the zealot&#146;s smite attacks bypass the creature&#146;s DR as if it were a weapon with a +5 enhancement bonus.</p>
			<p>At 5th level, and every 3 vigilante levels thereafter, a zealot can smite one additional time per day, to a maximum of seven times per day at 20th level.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Talent: </b>Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a vigilante talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as possessing another vigilante talent, possessing a particular specialization, or attaining a minimum level. Once a talent has been selected, it can&#146;t be changed.</p>
			<p>If the vigilante uses any of these talents while in his social identity, he must succeed at a Disguise check against the Perception checks of all onlookers (without the +20 circumstance bonus from seamless guise) or the onlookers will realize that he is more than his social identity appears to be and perhaps discover the social and vigilante identities are one and the same. If a talent calls for a saving throw, the DC for that save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s level + the vigilante&#146;s Charisma modifier, unless stated otherwise.</p>
			<p><b>Unshakable (Ex): </b>Starting at 3rd level, a vigilante adds his class level to the DC of any attempts to Intimidate him.</p>
			<p><b>Startling Appearance (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a vigilante learns to use the element of surprise to his advantage, startling foes that are unaware of his presence. Whenever a vigilante with this ability attempts an attack against a foe that is completely unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (usually due to Stealth or invisibility), the foe is treated as flat-footed for the rest of the vigilante&#146;s turn (uncanny dodge or a similar ability prevents this effect unless the vigilante is at least 4 levels higher than the foe with uncanny dodge). The foe also takes a &#150;4 penalty on attacks made against the vigilante until the start of the vigilante&#146;s next turn.</p>
			<p><b>Frightening Appearance (Ex): </b>At 11th level, whenever a vigilante with this ability makes an attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance above), the vigilante can, as a free action, attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of his attack and any enemies within 10 feet who can see the attack. This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets. If the check succeeds against the target of the vigilante&#146;s attack, that foe is also frightened for 1 round, in addition to being shaken as normal, unless the foe succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier).</p>
			<p>Once a creature has been the target of this ability (either as the target of the attack or as a nearby creature, regardless of whether or not it was successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s frightening appearance for 24 hours. This effect is in addition to the bonuses gained from the startling appearance ability. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Stunning Appearance (Ex) </b>: At 17th level, a vigilante can leave his foes unable to respond when he appears. Whenever a vigilante with this ability makes a successful attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance), the foe must make a successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier) or be stunned until the end of the vigilante&#146;s next turn. If the creature has more HD than the vigilante&#146;s class level, it receives a +4 circumstance bonus on this save. This ability is in addition to the effects of startling appearance and frightening appearance. Once a creature has been the target of this ability (regardless of whether or not the saving throw is successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s stunning appearance for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Vengeance Strike (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>

				<name type="string">Dual Identity</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante&#146;s true identity revealed to the world at large.</p>
					<p>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante&#146;s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user&#146;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p>
					<p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante&#146;s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#146;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante&#146;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>
					<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>

				<name type="string">Vigilante Specialization</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a vigilante must choose to be either an avenger or a stalker.</p>
					<p>An avenger gains a base attack bonus equal to his vigilante level instead of using those listed on Table 1&#150;1. He adds this value to any other base attack bonus gained from other classes or racial Hit Dice as normal.</p>
					<p>A stalker gains an ability called hidden strike, which allows him to deal an extra 1d8 points of precision damage on melee attacks (or ranged attacks from within 30 feet) against foes who are unaware of his presence, who consider him an ally, or who are made flat-footed by startling appearance (see page 17). This extra damage increases by 1d8 at 3rd level and every 2 vigilante levels thereafter. A stalker vigilante can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that he is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage dice are reduced to d4s. A stalker can deal hidden strike damage against targets with concealment (but not total concealment).</p>
					<p>Once this choice is made, it can&#146;t be changed. While many vigilante talents are usable by both specializations, some are unique to each specialization. A stalker vigilante can apply only one talent marked with an asterisk (*) to a given hidden strike, and only when that hidden strike is dealt against a foe that is unaware of the stalker vigilante&#146;s presence (or who considers him an ally), unless otherwise noted.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Within some vigilantes are incredible innate abilities that, although normally the domain of natural beasts, inexplicably aid them in fighting their enemies. These vigilantes have ties to the creature whose abilities they emulate, whether from a distant lycanthrope ancestor, a divine touch, unnatural experimentation, or something else altogether.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Life can be unfair. Think of the starving peasants forced to toil for the local baron or the common laborers tasked with building the king&#146;s newest palace for a mere handful of copper pieces each week. There are those who see these injustices and do nothing. There are those who are willing to reap the rewards obtained through the suffering of others. Then there are those who see inequality and find themselves driven to take action, outside the law if necessary. These vigilantes operate in plain sight, hiding behind respectable personas by day, but donning alternate guises by night to right the wrongs they see all around them.</p>
			<p>Not all vigilantes are out to make the world a better place. Some criminals hide behind the pretense of being ordinary folk, only to become terrors in the shadows, stealing and killing to fulfill some dark agenda. In either case, the vigilante is a character of two natures&#151;the face that everyone knows and the mask that inspires fear.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A vigilante can take on many tasks within a group. Most are skilled at negotiating delicate social situations and courtly intrigue, but they can also serve as stealthy spies or even brutish warriors in dangerous environments.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Vigilante's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Abilities</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Vigilantes are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Dual Identity (Ex): </b>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante&#146;s true identity revealed to the world at large.</p>
			<p>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante&#146;s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user&#146;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p>
			<p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante&#146;s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#146;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante&#146;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>
			<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>
			<p>Seamless Guise (Ex): A vigilante knows how to behave in a way that appears perfectly proper and normal for his current identity. Should anyone suspect him of being anything other than what he appears to be while either in his social or vigilante identity, he can attempt a Disguise check with a +20 circumstance bonus to appear as his current identity, and not as his other identity.</p>
			<p><b>Social Talent: </b>Starting at 1st level, and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a social talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet other prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as having another social talent or attaining a minimum vigilante level. Once a talent has been chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Specialization (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a vigilante must choose to be either an avenger or a stalker.</p>
			<p>An avenger gains a base attack bonus equal to his vigilante level instead of using those listed on Table 1&#150;1. He adds this value to any other base attack bonus gained from other classes or racial Hit Dice as normal.</p>
			<p>A stalker gains an ability called hidden strike, which allows him to deal an extra 1d8 points of precision damage on melee attacks (or ranged attacks from within 30 feet) against foes who are unaware of his presence, who consider him an ally, or who are made flat-footed by startling appearance (see page 17). This extra damage increases by 1d8 at 3rd level and every 2 vigilante levels thereafter. A stalker vigilante can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that he is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage dice are reduced to d4s. A stalker can deal hidden strike damage against targets with concealment (but not total concealment).</p>
			<p>Once this choice is made, it can&#146;t be changed. While many vigilante talents are usable by both specializations, some are unique to each specialization. A stalker vigilante can apply only one talent marked with an asterisk (*) to a given hidden strike, and only when that hidden strike is dealt against a foe that is unaware of the stalker vigilante&#146;s presence (or who considers him an ally), unless otherwise noted.</p>
			<p><b>Natural Course (Ex): </b>At first level, when a wildsoul chooses a vigilante specialization, he must also choose a natural course: arachnid, falconine, or ursine. This represents the type of creature that influences his body, granting him his remarkable abilities. Once this choice is made, it can&#146;t be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd, 6th, 12th, and 18th levels, a wildsoul gains a specific ability tied to his natural course. These abilities count as vigilante talents, as onlookers who see the wildsoul in his social identity use them overtly might suspect him of being something more than he appears; the more obvious animalistic abilities (like bear form and shoot webs) impart a &#150;10 penalty on the wildsoul&#146;s Disguise check to appear as his social identity.</p>
			<p>This alters vigilante specialization and replaces the vigilante talents gained at 2nd, 6th, 12th, and 18th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Talent: </b>Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a vigilante talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as possessing another vigilante talent, possessing a particular specialization, or attaining a minimum level. Once a talent has been selected, it can&#146;t be changed.</p>
			<p>If the vigilante uses any of these talents while in his social identity, he must succeed at a Disguise check against the Perception checks of all onlookers (without the +20 circumstance bonus from seamless guise) or the onlookers will realize that he is more than his social identity appears to be and perhaps discover the social and vigilante identities are one and the same. If a talent calls for a saving throw, the DC for that save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s level + the vigilante&#146;s Charisma modifier, unless stated otherwise.</p>
			<p><b>Unshakable (Ex): </b>Starting at 3rd level, a vigilante adds his class level to the DC of any attempts to Intimidate him.</p>
			<p><b>Startling Appearance (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a vigilante learns to use the element of surprise to his advantage, startling foes that are unaware of his presence. Whenever a vigilante with this ability attempts an attack against a foe that is completely unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (usually due to Stealth or invisibility), the foe is treated as flat-footed for the rest of the vigilante&#146;s turn (uncanny dodge or a similar ability prevents this effect unless the vigilante is at least 4 levels higher than the foe with uncanny dodge). The foe also takes a &#150;4 penalty on attacks made against the vigilante until the start of the vigilante&#146;s next turn.</p>
			<p><b>Frightening Appearance (Ex): </b>At 11th level, whenever a vigilante with this ability makes an attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance above), the vigilante can, as a free action, attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of his attack and any enemies within 10 feet who can see the attack. This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets. If the check succeeds against the target of the vigilante&#146;s attack, that foe is also frightened for 1 round, in addition to being shaken as normal, unless the foe succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier).</p>
			<p>Once a creature has been the target of this ability (either as the target of the attack or as a nearby creature, regardless of whether or not it was successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s frightening appearance for 24 hours. This effect is in addition to the bonuses gained from the startling appearance ability. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Stunning Appearance (Ex) </b>: At 17th level, a vigilante can leave his foes unable to respond when he appears. Whenever a vigilante with this ability makes a successful attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance), the foe must make a successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier) or be stunned until the end of the vigilante&#146;s next turn. If the creature has more HD than the vigilante&#146;s class level, it receives a +4 circumstance bonus on this save. This ability is in addition to the effects of startling appearance and frightening appearance. Once a creature has been the target of this ability (regardless of whether or not the saving throw is successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s stunning appearance for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Vengeance Strike (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>

				<name type="string">Mystic Bolts</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A warlock can sling projectiles of magical energy at will by shooting a bolt or touching her foe. A melee mystic bolt requires the target to be within reach, and a ranged mystic bolt is a ranged attack with a range of 30 feet. A mystic bolt deals 1d6 points of damage plus 1 for every 4 vigilante levels the warlock has. The warlock must choose one type of damage for her mystic bolt: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. Attacking with a mystic bolt takes the place of one of the warlock&#146;s normal attacks, and she can make a full attack using mystic bolts. The warlock vigilante attacks with mystic bolts as though they were light one-handed weapons, and the bolts can be used for two-weapon fighting (with each hand creating one mystic bolt) and feats and abilities that apply to weapon attacks (unless they&#146;re excluded from that feat, such as with Power Attack). Weapon Focus (ray) doesn&#146;t apply to mystic bolts, but a warlock can take Weapon Focus (mystic bolt) and apply it to both melee and ranged mystic bolts.</p>
					<p>Creating a mystic bolt requires the hand to be free, but the bolt appears only briefly, so a warlock using mystic bolts has a free hand any time she isn&#146;t attacking with a mystic bolt. The warlock threatens with a mystic bolt, but only if she has a hand free. Because mystic bolts are impermanent, a spell that targets a single weapon (like magic weapon) can&#146;t affect it, nor can a mystic bolt be made with magic weapon special abilities. Abilities that affect all weapon attacks the warlock makes, such as the arcane striker warlock talent, function with mystic bolts.</p>
					<p>At 7th level and every 6 vigilante levels thereafter, the warlock chooses another damage type from the list above. Each time she creates a mystic bolt, she can have it use any one of the damage types she has selected.</p>

					<p>At 11th level, whenever a vigilante with this ability makes an attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance above), the vigilante can, as a free action, attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of his attack and any enemies within 10 feet who can see the attack. This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets. If the check succeeds against the target of the vigilante&#146;s attack, that foe is also frightened for 1 round, in addition to being shaken as normal, unless the foe succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier).</p>
					<p>Once a creature has been the target of this ability (either as the target of the attack or as a nearby creature, regardless of whether or not it was successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s frightening appearance for 24 hours.

If the creature has more HD than the vigilante&#146;s class level, it receives a +4 circumstance bonus on this save.

					<p>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Practicing magic in secret, the warlock obscures her arcane scholarship from public view. Her study of these arts allows her to hide her dual nature and enchant her enemies&#151;or simply blast them with furious magical attacks.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Life can be unfair. Think of the starving peasants forced to toil for the local baron or the common laborers tasked with building the king&#146;s newest palace for a mere handful of copper pieces each week. There are those who see these injustices and do nothing. There are those who are willing to reap the rewards obtained through the suffering of others. Then there are those who see inequality and find themselves driven to take action, outside the law if necessary. These vigilantes operate in plain sight, hiding behind respectable personas by day, but donning alternate guises by night to right the wrongs they see all around them.</p>
			<p>Not all vigilantes are out to make the world a better place. Some criminals hide behind the pretense of being ordinary folk, only to become terrors in the shadows, stealing and killing to fulfill some dark agenda. In either case, the vigilante is a character of two natures&#151;the face that everyone knows and the mask that inspires fear.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A vigilante can take on many tasks within a group. Most are skilled at negotiating delicate social situations and courtly intrigue, but they can also serve as stealthy spies or even brutish warriors in dangerous environments.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Vigilante's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Abilities</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Vigilantes are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor and shields (except tower shields). A warlock is not proficient with medium armor. Like a magus, she can cast her spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance.</p>
			<p><b>Dual Identity (Ex): </b>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante&#146;s true identity revealed to the world at large.</p>
			<p>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante&#146;s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user&#146;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p>
			<p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante&#146;s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#146;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante&#146;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>
			<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>
			<p>Seamless Guise (Ex): A vigilante knows how to behave in a way that appears perfectly proper and normal for his current identity. Should anyone suspect him of being anything other than what he appears to be while either in his social or vigilante identity, he can attempt a Disguise check with a +20 circumstance bonus to appear as his current identity, and not as his other identity.</p>
			<p><b>Social Talent: </b>Starting at 1st level, and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a social talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet other prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as having another social talent or attaining a minimum vigilante level. Once a talent has been chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Spellbook: </b>A warlock has a spellbook that functions in the same way as a magus&#146;s spellbook but uses the 6th-level and lower spells from the sorcerer/wizard spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spellcasting: </b>A warlock casts arcane spells and cantrips as a magus. She prepares spells using a spellbook, choosing them from the 6th-level and lower spells from the sorcerer/wizard spell list; higher-level sorcerer/wizard spells are not on the warlock&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p>This replaces the 4th-, 8th-, 10th-, 14th-, and 16th-level vigilante talents.</p>
			<p><b>Mystic Bolts (Su): </b>A warlock can sling projectiles of magical energy at will by shooting a bolt or touching her foe. A melee mystic bolt requires the target to be within reach, and a ranged mystic bolt is a ranged attack with a range of 30 feet. A mystic bolt deals 1d6 points of damage plus 1 for every 4 vigilante levels the warlock has. The warlock must choose one type of damage for her mystic bolt: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. Attacking with a mystic bolt takes the place of one of the warlock&#146;s normal attacks, and she can make a full attack using mystic bolts. The warlock vigilante attacks with mystic bolts as though they were light one-handed weapons, and the bolts can be used for two-weapon fighting (with each hand creating one mystic bolt) and feats and abilities that apply to weapon attacks (unless they&#146;re excluded from that feat, such as with Power Attack). Weapon Focus (ray) doesn&#146;t apply to mystic bolts, but a warlock can take Weapon Focus (mystic bolt) and apply it to both melee and ranged mystic bolts.</p>
			<p>Creating a mystic bolt requires the hand to be free, but the bolt appears only briefly, so a warlock using mystic bolts has a free hand any time she isn&#146;t attacking with a mystic bolt. The warlock threatens with a mystic bolt, but only if she has a hand free. Because mystic bolts are impermanent, a spell that targets a single weapon (like magic weapon) can&#146;t affect it, nor can a mystic bolt be made with magic weapon special abilities. Abilities that affect all weapon attacks the warlock makes, such as the arcane striker warlock talent, function with mystic bolts.</p>
			<p>At 7th level and every 6 vigilante levels thereafter, the warlock chooses another damage type from the list above. Each time she creates a mystic bolt, she can have it use any one of the damage types she has selected.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces vigilante specialization.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Talent: </b>Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a vigilante talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as possessing another vigilante talent, possessing a particular specialization, or attaining a minimum level. Once a talent has been selected, it can&#146;t be changed.</p>
			<p>If the vigilante uses any of these talents while in his social identity, he must succeed at a Disguise check against the Perception checks of all onlookers (without the +20 circumstance bonus from seamless guise) or the onlookers will realize that he is more than his social identity appears to be and perhaps discover the social and vigilante identities are one and the same. If a talent calls for a saving throw, the DC for that save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s level + the vigilante&#146;s Charisma modifier, unless stated otherwise.</p>
			<p><b>Warlock Talents: </b>A warlock can select from any of the following vigilante talents, in addition to general vigilante talents.</p>
			<p>This alters vigilante talents.</p>
			<p><i>Arcane Striker (Su): </i>The warlock gains Arcane Strike as a bonus feat. At 12th level, when she activates Arcane Strike, she can choose to also give her weapons the flaming, frost, shock, or thundering weapon special ability. She makes this choice each time she activates Arcane Strike, and it lasts for the same duration. At 16th level, she adds anarchic, axiomatic, flaming burst, holy, icy burst, shocking burst, and unholy to the list of special abilities she can select. She can choose to apply an alignment-based weapon special ability only while in her vigilante identity, and only if it matches the alignment of her vigilante identity.</p>
			<p><i>Elemental Armor (Su): </i>When in her vigilante identity, the warlock gains armor made of elemental energy. She is surrounded by a nimbus of ice, lightning, or flames, granting her resistance 5 to cold, electricity, or fire, respectively. The damage type must be chosen when she selects this talent, and it can&#146;t be changed. At 4th level, the warlock&#146;s armor deals 1d6 points of damage of the chosen energy type to any creature striking the warlock with a natural weapon or a non-reach melee weapon. A creature that attempts a grapple combat maneuver check against the warlock also takes this damage. A creature can take damage in this way no more than once per round. At 8th level, the energy resistance increases to 10. At 12th level, the damage increases to 2d6 points. At 16th level, the warlock becomes immune to the chosen damage type while in her vigilante identity.</p>
			<p><i>Familiar (Ex): </i>The warlock gains a familiar, using her vigilante level as her effective wizard level. The familiar also has a social identity as a seemingly normal animal, though warlocks with outlandish familiars might still need to hide them.</p>
			<p><i>Social Simulacrum (Sp): </i>The warlock can create a shortlived simulacrum (as lesser simulacrum on page 238 of Ultimate Magic) that duplicates her social identity, allowing her to appear to be in two places at once. Creating the duplicate takes 1 hour and requires no material component cost. It lasts for 4 hours before turning back into an inert pile of snow. The duplicate replicates only the warlock&#146;s social identity, with the same alignment and social talents. It has no magical abilities, and can&#146;t assume a vigilante identity. As with the spell, the simulacrum isn&#146;t under the warlock&#146;s control. The warlock can create a social simulacrum no more than once per day and can have only one in existence at a time. A warlock must be at least 8th level to select this talent.</p>
			<p><i>Tattoo Chamber (Su): </i>This talent functions as the cabalist ability of the same name.</p>
			<p><b>Piercing Bolts (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, the warlock can choose one mystic bolt per round to be a touch attack. This turns a melee mystic bolt into a melee touch attack or a ranged mystic bolt into a ranged touch attack. At 5th level, the warlock can treat all of her mystic bolts as touch attacks.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces unshakable.</p>
			<p><b>Startling Appearance (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a vigilante learns to use the element of surprise to his advantage, startling foes that are unaware of his presence. Whenever a vigilante with this ability attempts an attack against a foe that is completely unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (usually due to Stealth or invisibility), the foe is treated as flat-footed for the rest of the vigilante&#146;s turn (uncanny dodge or a similar ability prevents this effect unless the vigilante is at least 4 levels higher than the foe with uncanny dodge). The foe also takes a &#150;4 penalty on attacks made against the vigilante until the start of the vigilante&#146;s next turn.</p>
			<p><b>Frightening Appearance (Ex): </b>At 11th level, whenever a vigilante with this ability makes an attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance above), the vigilante can, as a free action, attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of his attack and any enemies within 10 feet who can see the attack. This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets. If the check succeeds against the target of the vigilante&#146;s attack, that foe is also frightened for 1 round, in addition to being shaken as normal, unless the foe succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier).</p>
			<p>Once a creature has been the target of this ability (either as the target of the attack or as a nearby creature, regardless of whether or not it was successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s frightening appearance for 24 hours. This effect is in addition to the bonuses gained from the startling appearance ability. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Stunning Appearance (Ex) </b>: At 17th level, a vigilante can leave his foes unable to respond when he appears. Whenever a vigilante with this ability makes a successful attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance), the foe must make a successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier) or be stunned until the end of the vigilante&#146;s next turn. If the creature has more HD than the vigilante&#146;s class level, it receives a +4 circumstance bonus on this save. This ability is in addition to the effects of startling appearance and frightening appearance. Once a creature has been the target of this ability (regardless of whether or not the saving throw is successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s stunning appearance for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Vengeance Strike (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>

				<level type="number">1</level>
				<name type="string">Dual Identity</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante&#146;s true identity revealed to the world at large.</p>
					<p>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante&#146;s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user&#146;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p>
					<p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante&#146;s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#146;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante&#146;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>
					<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>

				<name type="string">Vigilante Specialization</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a vigilante must choose to be either an avenger or a stalker.</p>
					<p>An avenger gains a base attack bonus equal to his vigilante level instead of using those listed on Table 1&#150;1. He adds this value to any other base attack bonus gained from other classes or racial Hit Dice as normal.</p>
					<p>A stalker gains an ability called hidden strike, which allows him to deal an extra 1d8 points of precision damage on melee attacks (or ranged attacks from within 30 feet) against foes who are unaware of his presence, who consider him an ally, or who are made flat-footed by startling appearance (see page 17). This extra damage increases by 1d8 at 3rd level and every 2 vigilante levels thereafter. A stalker vigilante can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that he is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage dice are reduced to d4s. A stalker can deal hidden strike damage against targets with concealment (but not total concealment).</p>
					<p>Once this choice is made, it can&#146;t be changed. While many vigilante talents are usable by both specializations, some are unique to each specialization. A stalker vigilante can apply only one talent marked with an asterisk (*) to a given hidden strike, and only when that hidden strike is dealt against a foe that is unaware of the stalker vigilante&#146;s presence (or who considers him an ally), unless otherwise noted.</p>

					<p>Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a vigilante talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once.

					<p>At 11th level, whenever a vigilante with this ability makes an attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance above), the vigilante can, as a free action, attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of his attack and any enemies within 10 feet who can see the attack. This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets. If the check succeeds against the target of the vigilante&#146;s attack, that foe is also frightened for 1 round, in addition to being shaken as normal, unless the foe succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier).</p>

					<p>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Teisatsu are specialized vigilantes who focus on infiltrating social scenes and high-society gatherings on behalf of the feuding lords of Minkai. Trained as assassins and spies, they cultivate a suite of personalities and study secret arts that hone their bodies into deadly weapons.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Life can be unfair. Think of the starving peasants forced to toil for the local baron or the common laborers tasked with building the king&#146;s newest palace for a mere handful of copper pieces each week. There are those who see these injustices and do nothing. There are those who are willing to reap the rewards obtained through the suffering of others. Then there are those who see inequality and find themselves driven to take action, outside the law if necessary. These vigilantes operate in plain sight, hiding behind respectable personas by day, but donning alternate guises by night to right the wrongs they see all around them.</p>
			<p>Not all vigilantes are out to make the world a better place. Some criminals hide behind the pretense of being ordinary folk, only to become terrors in the shadows, stealing and killing to fulfill some dark agenda. In either case, the vigilante is a character of two natures&#151;the face that everyone knows and the mask that inspires fear.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A vigilante can take on many tasks within a group. Most are skilled at negotiating delicate social situations and courtly intrigue, but they can also serve as stealthy spies or even brutish warriors in dangerous environments.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Vigilante's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Abilities</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Teisatsu are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the kama, katana, kusarigama, nunchaku, sai, short sword, shortbow, shuriken, siangham, and wakizashi. They are proficient with light and medium armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Dual Identity (Ex): </b>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante&#146;s true identity revealed to the world at large.</p>
			<p>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante&#146;s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user&#146;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p>
			<p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante&#146;s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#146;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante&#146;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>
			<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>
			<p>Seamless Guise (Ex): A vigilante knows how to behave in a way that appears perfectly proper and normal for his current identity. Should anyone suspect him of being anything other than what he appears to be while either in his social or vigilante identity, he can attempt a Disguise check with a +20 circumstance bonus to appear as his current identity, and not as his other identity.</p>
			<p><b>Social Talent: </b>Starting at 1st level, and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a social talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet other prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as having another social talent or attaining a minimum vigilante level. Once a talent has been chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Infiltrator (Ex): </b>A teisatsu is required to choose stalker as his specialization.</p>
			<p>This alters vigilante specialization.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Specialization (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a vigilante must choose to be either an avenger or a stalker.</p>
			<p>An avenger gains a base attack bonus equal to his vigilante level instead of using those listed on Table 1&#150;1. He adds this value to any other base attack bonus gained from other classes or racial Hit Dice as normal.</p>
			<p>A stalker gains an ability called hidden strike, which allows him to deal an extra 1d8 points of precision damage on melee attacks (or ranged attacks from within 30 feet) against foes who are unaware of his presence, who consider him an ally, or who are made flat-footed by startling appearance (see page 17). This extra damage increases by 1d8 at 3rd level and every 2 vigilante levels thereafter. A stalker vigilante can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that he is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage dice are reduced to d4s. A stalker can deal hidden strike damage against targets with concealment (but not total concealment).</p>
			<p>Once this choice is made, it can&#146;t be changed. While many vigilante talents are usable by both specializations, some are unique to each specialization. A stalker vigilante can apply only one talent marked with an asterisk (*) to a given hidden strike, and only when that hidden strike is dealt against a foe that is unaware of the stalker vigilante&#146;s presence (or who considers him an ally), unless otherwise noted.</p>
			<p><b>Ki Pool (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a teisatsu gains a ki pool, identical to the ninja class feature (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 14), using his vigilante level as his effective ninja level.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the vigilante talent gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Unshakable (Ex): </b>Starting at 3rd level, a vigilante adds his class level to the DC of any attempts to Intimidate him.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Talent: </b>Starting at 4nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a vigilante talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as possessing another vigilante talent, possessing a particular specialization, or attaining a minimum level. Once a talent has been selected, it can&#146;t be changed.If the vigilante uses any of these talents while in his social identity, he must succeed at a Disguise check against the Perception checks of all onlookers (without the +20 circumstance bonus from seamless guise) or the onlookers will realize that he is more than his social identity appears to be and perhaps discover the social and vigilante identities are one and the same. If a talent calls for a saving throw, the DC for that save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s level + the vigilante&#146;s Charisma modifier, unless stated otherwise.</p>
			<p><b>Startling Appearance (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a vigilante learns to use the element of surprise to his advantage, startling foes that are unaware of his presence. Whenever a vigilante with this ability attempts an attack against a foe that is completely unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (usually due to Stealth or invisibility), the foe is treated as flat-footed for the rest of the vigilante&#146;s turn (uncanny dodge or a similar ability prevents this effect unless the vigilante is at least 4 levels higher than the foe with uncanny dodge). The foe also takes a &#150;4 penalty on attacks made against the vigilante until the start of the vigilante&#146;s next turn.</p>
			<p><b>Frightening Appearance (Ex): </b>At 11th level, whenever a vigilante with this ability makes an attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance above), the vigilante can, as a free action, attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of his attack and any enemies within 10 feet who can see the attack. This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets. If the check succeeds against the target of the vigilante&#146;s attack, that foe is also frightened for 1 round, in addition to being shaken as normal, unless the foe succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier).</p>
			<p>Once a creature has been the target of this ability (either as the target of the attack or as a nearby creature, regardless of whether or not it was successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s frightening appearance for 24 hours. This effect is in addition to the bonuses gained from the startling appearance ability. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Stunning Appearance (Ex) </b>: At 17th level, a vigilante can leave his foes unable to respond when he appears. Whenever a vigilante with this ability makes a successful attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance), the foe must make a successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier) or be stunned until the end of the vigilante&#146;s next turn. If the creature has more HD than the vigilante&#146;s class level, it receives a +4 circumstance bonus on this save. This ability is in addition to the effects of startling appearance and frightening appearance. Once a creature has been the target of this ability (regardless of whether or not the saving throw is successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s stunning appearance for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Vengeance Strike (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a vigilante must choose to be either an avenger or a stalker.</p>
					<p>An avenger gains a base attack bonus equal to his vigilante level instead of using those listed on Table 1&#150;1. He adds this value to any other base attack bonus gained from other classes or racial Hit Dice as normal.</p>
					<p>A stalker gains an ability called hidden strike, which allows him to deal an extra 1d8 points of precision damage on melee attacks (or ranged attacks from within 30 feet) against foes who are unaware of his presence, who consider him an ally, or who are made flat-footed by startling appearance (see page 17). This extra damage increases by 1d8 at 3rd level and every 2 vigilante levels thereafter. A stalker vigilante can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that he is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage dice are reduced to d4s. A stalker can deal hidden strike damage against targets with concealment (but not total concealment).</p>
					<p>Once this choice is made, it can&#146;t be changed. While many vigilante talents are usable by both specializations, some are unique to each specialization. A stalker vigilante can apply only one talent marked with an asterisk (*) to a given hidden strike, and only when that hidden strike is dealt against a foe that is unaware of the stalker vigilante&#146;s presence (or who considers him an ally), unless otherwise noted.</p>

Whenever a vigilante with this ability attempts an attack against a foe that is completely unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (usually due to Stealth or invisibility), the foe is treated as flat-footed for the rest of the vigilante&#146;s turn (uncanny dodge or a similar ability prevents this effect unless the vigilante is at least 4 levels higher than the foe with uncanny dodge).

					<p>At 11th level, whenever a vigilante with this ability makes an attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance above), the vigilante can, as a free action, attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of his attack and any enemies within 10 feet who can see the attack. This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets. If the check succeeds against the target of the vigilante&#146;s attack, that foe is also frightened for 1 round, in addition to being shaken as normal, unless the foe succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier).</p>
					<p>Once a creature has been the target of this ability (either as the target of the attack or as a nearby creature, regardless of whether or not it was successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s frightening appearance for 24 hours.

If the creature has more HD than the vigilante&#146;s class level, it receives a +4 circumstance bonus on this save.

					<p>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>

					<p>A splintersoul&#146;s two identities are even more distant from one another than those of a normal vigilante. He cannot use any of his vigilante talents while in his social identity.</p>
					<p>However, for the purpose of qualifying for classes, feats, and other abilities, he is eligible if one of his alignments meets the requirements. While in an identity whose alignment is incompatible with an ability, class, or feat, he temporarily loses access to the feat or ability or is treated as an ex-member of the class, as appropriate.</p>
					<p>For example, a splintersoul with barbarian levels, a lawful-good social identity, and a neutral vigilante identity can&#146;t use his vigilante talents or his rage class feature while in his social identity, but he regains these abilities and can use them as normal as soon as he changes to his vigilante identity.</p>
					<p>A splintersoul with paladin levels must follow the paladin&#146;s normal code of conduct while in a lawful-good identity, but while in an identity with a different alignment, the following changes apply to his code: Willingly committing an evil act (for example, casting a spell with the evil descriptor) still causes the vigilante to become an ex-paladin, but otherwise, he can do whatever else he feels is necessary to uphold the causes of law and good. He should strive to act with honor and uphold the tenets of his faith, but failing to do so is not a violation of his code. At the GM&#146;s discretion, other classes or archetypes with similarly strict codes of conduct can also follow a less strict version of a code of conduct while in an identity with an incompatible alignment.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A splintersoul pushes the boundaries of what it means to have two separate identities. One may be kind and calm while the other is angry and heartless, and the change from one identity to another is sudden and frightening. The splintersoul is torn by conflicting emotions and thoughts, but because of his dual mind, he can master a uniquely disparate set of skills and abilities no normal person should be able to manage.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Life can be unfair. Think of the starving peasants forced to toil for the local baron or the common laborers tasked with building the king&#146;s newest palace for a mere handful of copper pieces each week. There are those who see these injustices and do nothing. There are those who are willing to reap the rewards obtained through the suffering of others. Then there are those who see inequality and find themselves driven to take action, outside the law if necessary. These vigilantes operate in plain sight, hiding behind respectable personas by day, but donning alternate guises by night to right the wrongs they see all around them.</p>
			<p>Not all vigilantes are out to make the world a better place. Some criminals hide behind the pretense of being ordinary folk, only to become terrors in the shadows, stealing and killing to fulfill some dark agenda. In either case, the vigilante is a character of two natures&#151;the face that everyone knows and the mask that inspires fear.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A vigilante can take on many tasks within a group. Most are skilled at negotiating delicate social situations and courtly intrigue, but they can also serve as stealthy spies or even brutish warriors in dangerous environments.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>

			<h>Class Abilities</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Vigilantes are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Dual Identity (Ex): </b>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante&#146;s true identity revealed to the world at large.</p>
			<p>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante&#146;s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user&#146;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p>
			<p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante&#146;s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#146;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante&#146;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>
			<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>
			<p>Seamless Guise (Ex): A vigilante knows how to behave in a way that appears perfectly proper and normal for his current identity. Should anyone suspect him of being anything other than what he appears to be while either in his social or vigilante identity, he can attempt a Disguise check with a +20 circumstance bonus to appear as his current identity, and not as his other identity.</p>
			<p><b>Social Talent: </b>Starting at 1st level, and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a social talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet other prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as having another social talent or attaining a minimum vigilante level. Once a talent has been chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Splintered Identity (Ex): </b>A splintersoul&#146;s two identities are even more distant from one another than those of a normal vigilante. He cannot use any of his vigilante talents while in his social identity.</p>
			<p>However, for the purpose of qualifying for classes, feats, and other abilities, he is eligible if one of his alignments meets the requirements. While in an identity whose alignment is incompatible with an ability, class, or feat, he temporarily loses access to the feat or ability or is treated as an ex-member of the class, as appropriate.</p>
			<p>For example, a splintersoul with barbarian levels, a lawful-good social identity, and a neutral vigilante identity can&#146;t use his vigilante talents or his rage class feature while in his social identity, but he regains these abilities and can use them as normal as soon as he changes to his vigilante identity.</p>
			<p>A splintersoul with paladin levels must follow the paladin&#146;s normal code of conduct while in a lawful-good identity, but while in an identity with a different alignment, the following changes apply to his code: Willingly committing an evil act (for example, casting a spell with the evil descriptor) still causes the vigilante to become an ex-paladin, but otherwise, he can do whatever else he feels is necessary to uphold the causes of law and good. He should strive to act with honor and uphold the tenets of his faith, but failing to do so is not a violation of his code. At the GM&#146;s discretion, other classes or archetypes with similarly strict codes of conduct can also follow a less strict version of a code of conduct while in an identity with an incompatible alignment.</p>
			<p>This alters dual identity.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Specialization (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a vigilante must choose to be either an avenger or a stalker.</p>
			<p>An avenger gains a base attack bonus equal to his vigilante level instead of using those listed on Table 1&#150;1. He adds this value to any other base attack bonus gained from other classes or racial Hit Dice as normal.</p>
			<p>A stalker gains an ability called hidden strike, which allows him to deal an extra 1d8 points of precision damage on melee attacks (or ranged attacks from within 30 feet) against foes who are unaware of his presence, who consider him an ally, or who are made flat-footed by startling appearance (see page 17). This extra damage increases by 1d8 at 3rd level and every 2 vigilante levels thereafter. A stalker vigilante can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that he is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage dice are reduced to d4s. A stalker can deal hidden strike damage against targets with concealment (but not total concealment).</p>
			<p>Once this choice is made, it can&#146;t be changed. While many vigilante talents are usable by both specializations, some are unique to each specialization. A stalker vigilante can apply only one talent marked with an asterisk (*) to a given hidden strike, and only when that hidden strike is dealt against a foe that is unaware of the stalker vigilante&#146;s presence (or who considers him an ally), unless otherwise noted.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Talent: </b>Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a vigilante talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as possessing another vigilante talent, possessing a particular specialization, or attaining a minimum level. Once a talent has been selected, it can&#146;t be changed.</p>
			<p>If the vigilante uses any of these talents while in his social identity, he must succeed at a Disguise check against the Perception checks of all onlookers (without the +20 circumstance bonus from seamless guise) or the onlookers will realize that he is more than his social identity appears to be and perhaps discover the social and vigilante identities are one and the same. If a talent calls for a saving throw, the DC for that save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s level + the vigilante&#146;s Charisma modifier, unless stated otherwise.</p>
			<p><b>Sudden Change (Ex): </b>More adaptive than other vigilantes, a splintersoul must select the quick change social talent at 3rd level and the immediate change social talent at 7th level, ignoring the minimum levels for those talents.</p>
			<p>This replaces unshakable and alters the social talents gained at 3rd and 7th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Startling Appearance (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a vigilante learns to use the element of surprise to his advantage, startling foes that are unaware of his presence. Whenever a vigilante with this ability attempts an attack against a foe that is completely unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (usually due to Stealth or invisibility), the foe is treated as flat-footed for the rest of the vigilante&#146;s turn (uncanny dodge or a similar ability prevents this effect unless the vigilante is at least 4 levels higher than the foe with uncanny dodge). The foe also takes a &#150;4 penalty on attacks made against the vigilante until the start of the vigilante&#146;s next turn.</p>
			<p><b>Surprising Change (Ex): </b>At 7th level, when a splintersoul uses the immediate change talent to reveal his vigilante identity and then attacks a foe in the same round, he can use the startling appearance ability against that foe as though the foe were unaware of his presence. At 11th and 17th levels, he can use frightening appearance and stunning appearance, respectively, while using this ability. A splintersoul can use frightening appearance and stunning appearance only against foes who are unaware of his presence, and he can do so a number of times per day equal to his Charisma modifier. This ability doesn&#146;t function against foes who already know the splintersoul&#146;s identity.</p>
			<p>This alters startling appearance, frightening appearance, and stunning appearance.</p>
			<p><b>Frightening Appearance (Ex): </b>At 11th level, whenever a vigilante with this ability makes an attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance above), the vigilante can, as a free action, attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of his attack and any enemies within 10 feet who can see the attack. This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets. If the check succeeds against the target of the vigilante&#146;s attack, that foe is also frightened for 1 round, in addition to being shaken as normal, unless the foe succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier).</p>
			<p>Once a creature has been the target of this ability (either as the target of the attack or as a nearby creature, regardless of whether or not it was successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s frightening appearance for 24 hours. This effect is in addition to the bonuses gained from the startling appearance ability. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Stunning Appearance (Ex) </b>: At 17th level, a vigilante can leave his foes unable to respond when he appears. Whenever a vigilante with this ability makes a successful attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance), the foe must make a successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier) or be stunned until the end of the vigilante&#146;s next turn. If the creature has more HD than the vigilante&#146;s class level, it receives a +4 circumstance bonus on this save. This ability is in addition to the effects of startling appearance and frightening appearance. Once a creature has been the target of this ability (regardless of whether or not the saving throw is successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s stunning appearance for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Vengeance Strike (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some vigilantes adopt an innocent guise to cloak their acts of brutal murder.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Life can be unfair. Think of the starving peasants forced to toil for the local baron or the common laborers tasked with building the king&#146;s newest palace for a mere handful of copper pieces each week. There are those who see these injustices and do nothing. There are those who are willing to reap the rewards obtained through the suffering of others. Then there are those who see inequality and find themselves driven to take action, outside the law if necessary. These vigilantes operate in plain sight, hiding behind respectable personas by day, but donning alternate guises by night to right the wrongs they see all around them.</p>
			<p>Not all vigilantes are out to make the world a better place. Some criminals hide behind the pretense of being ordinary folk, only to become terrors in the shadows, stealing and killing to fulfill some dark agenda. In either case, the vigilante is a character of two natures&#151;the face that everyone knows and the mask that inspires fear.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A vigilante can take on many tasks within a group. Most are skilled at negotiating delicate social situations and courtly intrigue, but they can also serve as stealthy spies or even brutish warriors in dangerous environments.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any. A serial killer&#146;s vigilante identity must be evil. A serial killer whose vigilante identity becomes nonevil cannot gain new levels as a vigilante but retains all of her class abilities.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Vigilante's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Abilities</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Vigilantes are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Dual Identity (Ex): </b>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante&#146;s true identity revealed to the world at large.</p>
			<p>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante&#146;s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user&#146;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p>
			<p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante&#146;s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#146;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante&#146;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>
			<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>
			<p>Seamless Guise (Ex): A vigilante knows how to behave in a way that appears perfectly proper and normal for his current identity. Should anyone suspect him of being anything other than what he appears to be while either in his social or vigilante identity, he can attempt a Disguise check with a +20 circumstance bonus to appear as his current identity, and not as his other identity.</p>
			<p><b>Social Talent: </b>Starting at 1st level, and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a social talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet other prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as having another social talent or attaining a minimum vigilante level. Once a talent has been chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Specialization (Ex): </b>A serial killer must choose the stalker specialization. Her hidden strike is considered equivalent to a sneak attack with the same number of dice for the purpose of meeting prerequisites or using abilities that depend on sneak attack.</p>
			<p>This alters vigilante specialization.</p>
			<p>A stalker gains an ability called hidden strike, which allows him to deal an extra 1d8 points of precision damage on melee attacks (or ranged attacks from within 30 feet) against foes who are unaware of his presence, who consider him an ally, or who are made flat-footed by startling appearance (see page 17). This extra damage increases by 1d8 at 3rd level and every 2 vigilante levels thereafter. A stalker vigilante can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that he is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage dice are reduced to d4s. A stalker can deal hidden strike damage against targets with concealment (but not total concealment).</p>
			<p>Once this choice is made, it can&#146;t be changed. While many vigilante talents are usable by both specializations, some are unique to each specialization. A stalker vigilante can apply only one talent marked with an asterisk (*) to a given hidden strike, and only when that hidden strike is dealt against a foe that is unaware of the stalker vigilante&#146;s presence (or who considers him an ally), unless otherwise noted.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Talent: </b>Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a vigilante talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as possessing another vigilante talent, possessing a particular specialization, or attaining a minimum level. Once a talent has been selected, it can&#146;t be changed.</p>
			<p>If the vigilante uses any of these talents while in his social identity, he must succeed at a Disguise check against the Perception checks of all onlookers (without the +20 circumstance bonus from seamless guise) or the onlookers will realize that he is more than his social identity appears to be and perhaps discover the social and vigilante identities are one and the same. If a talent calls for a saving throw, the DC for that save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s level + the vigilante&#146;s Charisma modifier, unless stated otherwise.</p>
			<p><b>Thwart Pursuit (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a serial killer adds 1/2 her vigilante level as a bonus on all checks in a chase (Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide 232) and to the DCs of Diplomacy checks to gather information about her and checks to track her or notice her tracks (though not to the DC of the profiler&#146;s expert profiler ability; see page 55).</p>
			<p>This ability replaces unshakable.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Target (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a serial killer gains the studied targetACG ability of a slayer 3 levels lower, including the ability to study multiple targets simultaneously at the appropriate levels. The serial killer does not provoke attacks of opportunity when attempting a coup de grace against a studied target.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the 4th- and 14th-level vigilante talents and the 9th- and 19th-level social talents.</p>
			<p><b>Charming (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a serial killer gains the charmAPG hex as if she were a witch of her vigilante level, but she can&#146;t affect animals. The DC is based on her Charisma, and the ability is nonmagical.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces startling appearance.</p>
			<p><b>Death Attack (Ex): </b>At 6th level, a serial killer gains the ability to make a death attack as if she were an assassin (DC = 10 + 1/2 her vigilante level + her Charisma modifier).</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the 6th-level vigilante talent.</p>
			<p><b>Calling Card (Ex): </b>At 7th level, when a serial killer slays a humanoid with a coup de grace or death attack, she can leave a telltale token or clue behind identifying this death as her work. The serial killer chooses her calling card when she gains this ability, and the first time she uses it in an area where she has renown (as per the renown social talent), it becomes associated with her killings. After that, once citizens of a new settlement find this calling card, the serial killer immediately establishes the settlement as an area of renown for her vigilante identity without spending additional time to spread tales, and the Intimidate bonus from renown increases by 2. She still must spend time to establish her social identity&#146;s renown.</p>
			<p>This replaces the 7th-level social talent.</p>
			<p><b>Grisily Murder (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a serial killer gains Dreadful CarnageAPG as a bonus feat, and if she leaves a calling card, the murder is so horrifying that creatures examining the corpse are affected as per nightmare that night (DC = 10 + 1/2 the serial killer&#146;s vigilante level + her Charisma modifier). The nightmare affects a number of creatures equal to the serial killer&#146;s Charisma modifier, starting with the first creature to examine the corpse.</p>
			<p>This replaces frightening appearance.</p>
			<p><b>Quiet Death (Ex): </b>At 12th level, a serial killer gains the quiet death class feature as if she were an assassin.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the 12thlevel vigilante talent.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Death (Ex): </b>At 17th level, a serial killer gains the swift death class feature as an assassin.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the vigilante&#146;s stunning appearance.</p>
			<p><b>Vengeance Strike (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>

				<name type="string">Vigilante Specialization</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a vigilante must choose to be either an avenger or a stalker.</p>
					<p>An avenger gains a base attack bonus equal to his vigilante level instead of using those listed on Table 1&#150;1. He adds this value to any other base attack bonus gained from other classes or racial Hit Dice as normal.</p>
					<p>A stalker gains an ability called hidden strike, which allows him to deal an extra 1d8 points of precision damage on melee attacks (or ranged attacks from within 30 feet) against foes who are unaware of his presence, who consider him an ally, or who are made flat-footed by startling appearance (see page 17). This extra damage increases by 1d8 at 3rd level and every 2 vigilante levels thereafter. A stalker vigilante can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that he is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage dice are reduced to d4s. A stalker can deal hidden strike damage against targets with concealment (but not total concealment).</p>
					<p>Once this choice is made, it can&#146;t be changed. While many vigilante talents are usable by both specializations, some are unique to each specialization. A stalker vigilante can apply only one talent marked with an asterisk (*) to a given hidden strike, and only when that hidden strike is dealt against a foe that is unaware of the stalker vigilante&#146;s presence (or who considers him an ally), unless otherwise noted.</p>

				<name type="string">Implements and Focus Powers</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 2nd level, a psychometrist learns to use the powers of one implement school from the occultist class (Occult Adventures 47); the conjuration implement school is not available to a psychometrist. This implement school does not allow the psychometrist to cast any spells of that school of magic, though, and he can&#146;t use spell-trigger or spell-completion magic items from any schools without succeeding at the appropriate Use Magic Device check. A psychometrist can&#146;t select an implement school more than once. The psychometrist treats his vigilante level as his occultist level for purposes of determining how his implements&#146; focus powers work, and for determining at what level he may choose certain focus powers. Unlike an occultist, each of a psychometrist&#146;s focus powers has its own associated implement or gadget. For example, a psychometrist might own a scabbard implement to use the legacy weapon focus power and an implement that is a pair of boots to use the sudden speed focus power. The psychometrist must assign mental focus separately to each implement each day, and he doesn&#146;t gain resonant powers his implements. Otherwise, this ability acts like the occultist&#146;s implements class feature. At 6th, 12th, and 18th levels, the psychometrist learns to use one additional implement school.</p>
					<p>Each time a psychometrist learns an implement school, he learns the base focus power from that school, plus one focus power from each implement school he has previously learned (but not from the new school he just learned). The psychometrist can use focus powers only by expending mental focus (see below). Unless otherwise noted, the DC for any saving throw against a focus power equals 10 + 1/2 the psychometrist&#146;s vigilante level + the psychometrist&#146;s Intelligence modifier. The psychometrist can select a school he already knows, and in this case, he gains a total of two new focus powers from that school (instead of learning the base focus power from the new school).</p>

This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets.

On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Wise vigilantes know that there is power in certain seemingly unremarkable items. Psychometrists aren&#146;t spellcasters; instead, they collect strange items or create their own uncanny gadgets that seem to only work for them. Psychometrists often hide their clandestine activities behind the guise of an eccentric peddler, curator, tinker, or artificer.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Life can be unfair. Think of the starving peasants forced to toil for the local baron or the common laborers tasked with building the king&#146;s newest palace for a mere handful of copper pieces each week. There are those who see these injustices and do nothing. There are those who are willing to reap the rewards obtained through the suffering of others. Then there are those who see inequality and find themselves driven to take action, outside the law if necessary. These vigilantes operate in plain sight, hiding behind respectable personas by day, but donning alternate guises by night to right the wrongs they see all around them.</p>
			<p>Not all vigilantes are out to make the world a better place. Some criminals hide behind the pretense of being ordinary folk, only to become terrors in the shadows, stealing and killing to fulfill some dark agenda. In either case, the vigilante is a character of two natures&#151;the face that everyone knows and the mask that inspires fear.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A vigilante can take on many tasks within a group. Most are skilled at negotiating delicate social situations and courtly intrigue, but they can also serve as stealthy spies or even brutish warriors in dangerous environments.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Vigilante's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Abilities</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Vigilantes are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Dual Identity (Ex): </b>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante&#146;s true identity revealed to the world at large.</p>
			<p>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante&#146;s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user&#146;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p>
			<p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante&#146;s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#146;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante&#146;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>
			<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>
			<p>Seamless Guise (Ex): A vigilante knows how to behave in a way that appears perfectly proper and normal for his current identity. Should anyone suspect him of being anything other than what he appears to be while either in his social or vigilante identity, he can attempt a Disguise check with a +20 circumstance bonus to appear as his current identity, and not as his other identity.</p>
			<p><b>Occult Awareness: </b>At 1st level, a psychometrist gains Psychic Sensitivity (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 138) as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the social talent gained at 1st level.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Specialization (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a vigilante must choose to be either an avenger or a stalker.</p>
			<p>An avenger gains a base attack bonus equal to his vigilante level instead of using those listed on Table 1&#150;1. He adds this value to any other base attack bonus gained from other classes or racial Hit Dice as normal.</p>
			<p>A stalker gains an ability called hidden strike, which allows him to deal an extra 1d8 points of precision damage on melee attacks (or ranged attacks from within 30 feet) against foes who are unaware of his presence, who consider him an ally, or who are made flat-footed by startling appearance (see page 17). This extra damage increases by 1d8 at 3rd level and every 2 vigilante levels thereafter. A stalker vigilante can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that he is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage dice are reduced to d4s. A stalker can deal hidden strike damage against targets with concealment (but not total concealment).</p>
			<p>Once this choice is made, it can&#146;t be changed. While many vigilante talents are usable by both specializations, some are unique to each specialization. A stalker vigilante can apply only one talent marked with an asterisk (*) to a given hidden strike, and only when that hidden strike is dealt against a foe that is unaware of the stalker vigilante&#146;s presence (or who considers him an ally), unless otherwise noted.</p>
			<p><b>Implements and Focus Powers (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a psychometrist learns to use the powers of one implement school from the occultist class (Occult Adventures 47); the conjuration implement school is not available to a psychometrist. This implement school does not allow the psychometrist to cast any spells of that school of magic, though, and he can&#146;t use spell-trigger or spell-completion magic items from any schools without succeeding at the appropriate Use Magic Device check. A psychometrist can&#146;t select an implement school more than once. The psychometrist treats his vigilante level as his occultist level for purposes of determining how his implements&#146; focus powers work, and for determining at what level he may choose certain focus powers. Unlike an occultist, each of a psychometrist&#146;s focus powers has its own associated implement or gadget. For example, a psychometrist might own a scabbard implement to use the legacy weapon focus power and an implement that is a pair of boots to use the sudden speed focus power. The psychometrist must assign mental focus separately to each implement each day, and he doesn&#146;t gain resonant powers his implements. Otherwise, this ability acts like the occultist&#146;s implements class feature. At 6th, 12th, and 18th levels, the psychometrist learns to use one additional implement school.</p>
			<p>Each time a psychometrist learns an implement school, he learns the base focus power from that school, plus one focus power from each implement school he has previously learned (but not from the new school he just learned). The psychometrist can use focus powers only by expending mental focus (see below). Unless otherwise noted, the DC for any saving throw against a focus power equals 10 + 1/2 the psychometrist&#146;s vigilante level + the psychometrist&#146;s Intelligence modifier. The psychometrist can select a school he already knows, and in this case, he gains a total of two new focus powers from that school (instead of learning the base focus power from the new school).</p>
			<p>This replaces the vigilante talents gained at 2nd, 6th, 12th, and 18th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Mental Focus (Su): </b>At 2nd level, like an occultist, a psychometrist has mental focus he can invest into his implements each day to allow him to utilize abilities tied to them. A psychometrist has a number of points of mental focus equal to half his vigilante level plus his Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Object Reading (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a psychometrist can read information from items he examines, and gains the occultist&#146;s object reading ability (Occult Adventures 48).</p>
			<p><b>Social Talent: </b>Starting at 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a social talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet other prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as having another social talent or attaining a minimum vigilante level. Once a talent has been chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Talent: </b>Starting at 4nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (execpt for 6th, 12th, 18th), a vigilante gains a vigilante talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as possessing another vigilante talent, possessing a particular specialization, or attaining a minimum level. Once a talent has been selected, it can&#146;t be changed.If the vigilante uses any of these talents while in his social identity, he must succeed at a Disguise check against the Perception checks of all onlookers (without the +20 circumstance bonus from seamless guise) or the onlookers will realize that he is more than his social identity appears to be and perhaps discover the social and vigilante identities are one and the same. If a talent calls for a saving throw, the DC for that save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s level + the vigilante&#146;s Charisma modifier, unless stated otherwise.</p>
			<p><b>Startling Appearance (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a vigilante learns to use the element of surprise to his advantage, startling foes that are unaware of his presence. Whenever a vigilante with this ability attempts an attack against a foe that is completely unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (usually due to Stealth or invisibility), the foe is treated as flat-footed for the rest of the vigilante&#146;s turn (uncanny dodge or a similar ability prevents this effect unless the vigilante is at least 4 levels higher than the foe with uncanny dodge). The foe also takes a &#150;4 penalty on attacks made against the vigilante until the start of the vigilante&#146;s next turn.</p>
			<p><b>Frightening Appearance (Ex): </b>At 11th level, whenever a vigilante with this ability makes an attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance above), the vigilante can, as a free action, attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of his attack and any enemies within 10 feet who can see the attack. This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets. If the check succeeds against the target of the vigilante&#146;s attack, that foe is also frightened for 1 round, in addition to being shaken as normal, unless the foe succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier).</p>
			<p>Once a creature has been the target of this ability (either as the target of the attack or as a nearby creature, regardless of whether or not it was successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s frightening appearance for 24 hours. This effect is in addition to the bonuses gained from the startling appearance ability. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Stunning Appearance (Ex) </b>: At 17th level, a vigilante can leave his foes unable to respond when he appears. Whenever a vigilante with this ability makes a successful attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance), the foe must make a successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier) or be stunned until the end of the vigilante&#146;s next turn. If the creature has more HD than the vigilante&#146;s class level, it receives a +4 circumstance bonus on this save. This ability is in addition to the effects of startling appearance and frightening appearance. Once a creature has been the target of this ability (regardless of whether or not the saving throw is successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s stunning appearance for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Psychometric Strike (Su): </b>At 20th level, a psychometrist gains twice the usual benefits of vengeance strike (up to the same maximum) against an opponent who possesses an object that once belonged to the psychometrist.</p>
			<p>This ability alters vengeance strike.</p>
			<p><b>Vengeance Strike (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>

				<name type="string">Dual Identity</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante&#146;s true identity revealed to the world at large.</p>
					<p>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante&#146;s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user&#146;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p>
					<p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante&#146;s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#146;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante&#146;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>
					<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>

					<p>At 5th level, a vigilante learns to use the element of surprise to his advantage, startling foes that are unaware of his presence. Whenever a vigilante with this ability attempts an attack against a foe that is completely unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (usually due to Stealth or invisibility), the foe is treated as flat-footed for the rest of the vigilante&#146;s turn (uncanny dodge or a similar ability prevents this effect unless the vigilante is at least 4 levels higher than the foe with uncanny dodge). The foe also takes a &#150;4 penalty on attacks made against the vigilante until the start of the vigilante&#146;s next turn.</p>

					<p>At 11th level, whenever a vigilante with this ability makes an attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance above), the vigilante can, as a free action, attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of his attack and any enemies within 10 feet who can see the attack. This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets. If the check succeeds against the target of the vigilante&#146;s attack, that foe is also frightened for 1 round, in addition to being shaken as normal, unless the foe succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier).</p>

					<p>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20).

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Occasionally a mutation takes hold of the body of a vigilante, but he learns to hide his maladies, usually through alchemical concoctions or magical concealment. Unlike other mutants, who are usually shunned in Alkenstar and other settlements, mutated defenders can appear in public without revealing their mutations&#151;though they can still use them to their full potential in secret.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Life can be unfair. Think of the starving peasants forced to toil for the local baron or the common laborers tasked with building the king&#146;s newest palace for a mere handful of copper pieces each week. There are those who see these injustices and do nothing. There are those who are willing to reap the rewards obtained through the suffering of others. Then there are those who see inequality and find themselves driven to take action, outside the law if necessary. These vigilantes operate in plain sight, hiding behind respectable personas by day, but donning alternate guises by night to right the wrongs they see all around them.</p>
			<p>Not all vigilantes are out to make the world a better place. Some criminals hide behind the pretense of being ordinary folk, only to become terrors in the shadows, stealing and killing to fulfill some dark agenda. In either case, the vigilante is a character of two natures&#151;the face that everyone knows and the mask that inspires fear.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A vigilante can take on many tasks within a group. Most are skilled at negotiating delicate social situations and courtly intrigue, but they can also serve as stealthy spies or even brutish warriors in dangerous environments.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Vigilante's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Abilities</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Vigilantes are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Dual Identity (Ex): </b>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante&#146;s true identity revealed to the world at large.</p>
			<p>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante&#146;s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user&#146;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p>
			<p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante&#146;s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#146;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante&#146;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>
			<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>
			<p>Seamless Guise (Ex): A vigilante knows how to behave in a way that appears perfectly proper and normal for his current identity. Should anyone suspect him of being anything other than what he appears to be while either in his social or vigilante identity, he can attempt a Disguise check with a +20 circumstance bonus to appear as his current identity, and not as his other identity.</p>
			<p><b>Social Talent: </b>Starting at 1st level, and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a social talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet other prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as having another social talent or attaining a minimum vigilante level. Once a talent has been chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Mutant Specialization: </b>A mutated defender gains a base attack bonus equal to his vigilante level instead of using those listed in the vigilante&#146;s class table. He adds this value as normal to any other base attack bonus gained from other classes or racial Hit Dice. He also selects one mutant deformity (Bestiary 5 180) other than mindless or vulnerability. This deformity magically reverts when the vigilante is in his social identity, as do all mutations from his mutant talents, allowing him to hide his mutation entirely. Unlike with other vigilante talents, the vigilante is entirely unable to use the benefits of his mutant talents while in his social identity.</p>
			<p>This replaces vigilante specialization.</p>
			<p><b>Mutant Talents: </b>At 2nd level and every 2 vigilante levels thereafter, a mutated defender can select from the following mutant talents, in addition to the vigilante talents normally available to him.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Talent: </b>Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a vigilante talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as possessing another vigilante talent, possessing a particular specialization, or attaining a minimum level. Once a talent has been selected, it can&#146;t be changed.</p>
			<p>If the vigilante uses any of these talents while in his social identity, he must succeed at a Disguise check against the Perception checks of all onlookers (without the +20 circumstance bonus from seamless guise) or the onlookers will realize that he is more than his social identity appears to be and perhaps discover the social and vigilante identities are one and the same. If a talent calls for a saving throw, the DC for that save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s level + the vigilante&#146;s Charisma modifier, unless stated otherwise.</p>
			<p><b>Unshakable (Ex): </b>Starting at 3rd level, a vigilante adds his class level to the DC of any attempts to Intimidate him.</p>
			<p><b>Startling Appearance (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a vigilante learns to use the element of surprise to his advantage, startling foes that are unaware of his presence. Whenever a vigilante with this ability attempts an attack against a foe that is completely unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (usually due to Stealth or invisibility), the foe is treated as flat-footed for the rest of the vigilante&#146;s turn (uncanny dodge or a similar ability prevents this effect unless the vigilante is at least 4 levels higher than the foe with uncanny dodge). The foe also takes a &#150;4 penalty on attacks made against the vigilante until the start of the vigilante&#146;s next turn.</p>
			<p><b>Frightening Appearance (Ex): </b>At 11th level, whenever a vigilante with this ability makes an attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance above), the vigilante can, as a free action, attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of his attack and any enemies within 10 feet who can see the attack. This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets. If the check succeeds against the target of the vigilante&#146;s attack, that foe is also frightened for 1 round, in addition to being shaken as normal, unless the foe succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier).</p>
			<p>Once a creature has been the target of this ability (either as the target of the attack or as a nearby creature, regardless of whether or not it was successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s frightening appearance for 24 hours. This effect is in addition to the bonuses gained from the startling appearance ability. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Stunning Appearance (Ex) </b>: At 17th level, a vigilante can leave his foes unable to respond when he appears. Whenever a vigilante with this ability makes a successful attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance), the foe must make a successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier) or be stunned until the end of the vigilante&#146;s next turn. If the creature has more HD than the vigilante&#146;s class level, it receives a +4 circumstance bonus on this save. This ability is in addition to the effects of startling appearance and frightening appearance. Once a creature has been the target of this ability (regardless of whether or not the saving throw is successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s stunning appearance for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Vengeance Strike (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>

				<name type="string">Mount</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A mounted fury gains the service of a loyal and trusty steed to carry him into battle. This mount functions as a druid&#146;s animal companion, using the mounted fury&#146;s vigilante level as his effective druid level. The creature must be one that he is capable of riding and is suitable as a mount. A Medium mounted fury can select a camel or a horse. A Small mounted fury can select a pony or a wolf, but can also select a boar or a riding dog if he is at least 4th level. The GM might approve other animals as suitable mounts. A mounted fury can exchange or replace his mount the same way that a druid exchanges or replaces her animal companion.</p>
					<p>A mounted fury does not take an armor check penalty on Ride checks while riding his mount. The mount is always considered combat trained and begins play with Light Armor Proficiency as a bonus feat. A mounted fury&#146;s mount does not gain the share spells ability.</p>
					<p>A mounted fury&#146;s bond with his mount is strong, with the pair learning to anticipate each other&#146;s moods and moves. At 3rd level, the mounted fury&#146;s mount shares all his teamwork feats, without needing to meet the prerequisites (although while mounted, the mounted fury and his mount do not count as separate creatures for the purpose of these feats). At 5th level, the mounted fury&#146;s mount benefits from the vigilante&#146;s startling appearance as if it were the vigilante. Should a mounted fury&#146;s mount die, the mounted fury may find another mount to serve him after 1 week of mourning. This new mount does not gain the link or devotion special abilities until the next time the mounted fury gains a level.</p>
					<p>A mounted fury can select avenger vigilante talents, despite not being an avenger. He can also select a teamwork feat for which he qualifies in place of a vigilante talent; at 10th level, he gains an additional teamwork feat each time he does so (if he selected any teamwork feats in place of vigilante talents before 10th level, he gains an additional teamwork feat at 10th level for each time he did so).</p>

					<p>Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a vigilante talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once.

Once a talent has been selected, it can&#146;t be changed.</p>
					<p>If the vigilante uses any of these talents while in his social identity, he must succeed at a Disguise check against the Perception checks of all onlookers (without the +20 circumstance bonus from seamless guise) or the onlookers will realize that he is more than his social identity appears to be and perhaps discover the social and vigilante identities are one and the same.

					<p>At 12th level, a mounted fury learns to make devastating charge attacks while mounted. He doubles the critical threat range of any weapons he wields during a charge while mounted, as well as the critical threat range of the mount&#146;s attacks. This increase does not stack with other effects that increase the threat range of weapons. In addition, the mounted fury can make a free bull rush, disarm, sunder, or trip combat maneuver if his charge attack is successful.

					<p>At 11th level, whenever a vigilante with this ability makes an attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance above), the vigilante can, as a free action, attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of his attack and any enemies within 10 feet who can see the attack. This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets. If the check succeeds against the target of the vigilante&#146;s attack, that foe is also frightened for 1 round, in addition to being shaken as normal, unless the foe succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier).</p>
					<p>Once a creature has been the target of this ability (either as the target of the attack or as a nearby creature, regardless of whether or not it was successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s frightening appearance for 24 hours.

If the creature has more HD than the vigilante&#146;s class level, it receives a +4 circumstance bonus on this save.

					<p>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some vigilantes form special bonds with the creatures they use as steeds, considering these loyal and trusted mounts just as much heroes or antiheroes as they might be. Mounted furies often masquerade as anonymous stable hands or humble quartermasters to mask their vigilante activities.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Life can be unfair. Think of the starving peasants forced to toil for the local baron or the common laborers tasked with building the king&#146;s newest palace for a mere handful of copper pieces each week. There are those who see these injustices and do nothing. There are those who are willing to reap the rewards obtained through the suffering of others. Then there are those who see inequality and find themselves driven to take action, outside the law if necessary. These vigilantes operate in plain sight, hiding behind respectable personas by day, but donning alternate guises by night to right the wrongs they see all around them.</p>
			<p>Not all vigilantes are out to make the world a better place. Some criminals hide behind the pretense of being ordinary folk, only to become terrors in the shadows, stealing and killing to fulfill some dark agenda. In either case, the vigilante is a character of two natures&#151;the face that everyone knows and the mask that inspires fear.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A vigilante can take on many tasks within a group. Most are skilled at negotiating delicate social situations and courtly intrigue, but they can also serve as stealthy spies or even brutish warriors in dangerous environments.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Vigilante's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Abilities</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Vigilantes are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Dual Identity (Ex): </b>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante&#146;s true identity revealed to the world at large.</p>
			<p>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante&#146;s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user&#146;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p>
			<p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante&#146;s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#146;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante&#146;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>
			<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>
			<p><b>Thorough Change: </b>A mounted fury must take care when changing from one identity to another, including making any changes necessary to ensure that his mount is not associated with his social identity and vice versa (although if anyone suspects him of being anything other than what he appears to be while in his social identity, he need not make a separate Disguise check for his mount). The mounted fury always requires 1 minute to change identities, regardless of other effects that reduce the time required, and he cannot choose the immediate change or quick change social talents.</p>
			<p>This alters dual identity.</p>
			<p><b>Seamless Guise (Ex): </b>A vigilante knows how to behave in a way that appears perfectly proper and normal for his current identity. Should anyone suspect him of being anything other than what he appears to be while either in his social or vigilante identity, he can attempt a Disguise check with a +20 circumstance bonus to appear as his current identity, and not as his other identity.</p>
			<p><b>Mount (Ex): </b>A mounted fury gains the service of a loyal and trusty steed to carry him into battle. This mount functions as a druid&#146;s animal companion, using the mounted fury&#146;s vigilante level as his effective druid level. The creature must be one that he is capable of riding and is suitable as a mount. A Medium mounted fury can select a camel or a horse. A Small mounted fury can select a pony or a wolf, but can also select a boar or a riding dog if he is at least 4th level. The GM might approve other animals as suitable mounts. A mounted fury can exchange or replace his mount the same way that a druid exchanges or replaces her animal companion.</p>
			<p>A mounted fury does not take an armor check penalty on Ride checks while riding his mount. The mount is always considered combat trained and begins play with Light Armor Proficiency as a bonus feat. A mounted fury&#146;s mount does not gain the share spells ability.</p>
			<p>A mounted fury&#146;s bond with his mount is strong, with the pair learning to anticipate each other&#146;s moods and moves. At 3rd level, the mounted fury&#146;s mount shares all his teamwork feats, without needing to meet the prerequisites (although while mounted, the mounted fury and his mount do not count as separate creatures for the purpose of these feats). At 5th level, the mounted fury&#146;s mount benefits from the vigilante&#146;s startling appearance as if it were the vigilante. Should a mounted fury&#146;s mount die, the mounted fury may find another mount to serve him after 1 week of mourning. This new mount does not gain the link or devotion special abilities until the next time the mounted fury gains a level.</p>
			<p>A mounted fury can select avenger vigilante talents, despite not being an avenger. He can also select a teamwork feat for which he qualifies in place of a vigilante talent; at 10th level, he gains an additional teamwork feat each time he does so (if he selected any teamwork feats in place of vigilante talents before 10th level, he gains an additional teamwork feat at 10th level for each time he did so).</p>
			<p>This ability replaces vigilante specialization.</p>
			<p><b>Social Talent: </b>Starting at 1st level, and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a social talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet other prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as having another social talent or attaining a minimum vigilante level. Once a talent has been chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Talent: </b>Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a vigilante talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as possessing another vigilante talent, possessing a particular specialization, or attaining a minimum level. Once a talent has been selected, it can&#146;t be changed.</p>
			<p>If the vigilante uses any of these talents while in his social identity, he must succeed at a Disguise check against the Perception checks of all onlookers (without the +20 circumstance bonus from seamless guise) or the onlookers will realize that he is more than his social identity appears to be and perhaps discover the social and vigilante identities are one and the same. If a talent calls for a saving throw, the DC for that save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s level + the vigilante&#146;s Charisma modifier, unless stated otherwise.</p>
			<p><b>Unshakable (Ex): </b>Starting at 3rd level, a vigilante adds his class level to the DC of any attempts to Intimidate him.</p>
			<p><b>Startling Appearance (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a vigilante learns to use the element of surprise to his advantage, startling foes that are unaware of his presence. Whenever a vigilante with this ability attempts an attack against a foe that is completely unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (usually due to Stealth or invisibility), the foe is treated as flat-footed for the rest of the vigilante&#146;s turn (uncanny dodge or a similar ability prevents this effect unless the vigilante is at least 4 levels higher than the foe with uncanny dodge). The foe also takes a &#150;4 penalty on attacks made against the vigilante until the start of the vigilante&#146;s next turn.</p>
			<p><b>Furious Charge (Ex): </b>At 6th level, a mounted fury learns to make more accurate charge attacks while mounted. The mounted fury and his mount receive a +4 bonus on melee attack rolls on a charge while mounted (instead of the normal +2). In addition, the mounted fury and his mount don&#146;t take any penalty to AC after making a charge attack while mounted.</p>
			<p>This replaces the vigilante talent gained at 6th level.</p>
			<p><b>Frightening Appearance (Ex): </b>At 11th level, whenever a vigilante with this ability makes an attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance above), the vigilante can, as a free action, attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of his attack and any enemies within 10 feet who can see the attack. This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets. If the check succeeds against the target of the vigilante&#146;s attack, that foe is also frightened for 1 round, in addition to being shaken as normal, unless the foe succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier).</p>
			<p>Once a creature has been the target of this ability (either as the target of the attack or as a nearby creature, regardless of whether or not it was successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s frightening appearance for 24 hours. This effect is in addition to the bonuses gained from the startling appearance ability. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Mighty Charge (Ex): </b>At 12th level, a mounted fury learns to make devastating charge attacks while mounted. He doubles the critical threat range of any weapons he wields during a charge while mounted, as well as the critical threat range of the mount&#146;s attacks. This increase does not stack with other effects that increase the threat range of weapons. In addition, the mounted fury can make a free bull rush, disarm, sunder, or trip combat maneuver if his charge attack is successful. This free combat maneuver does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
			<p>This replaces the vigilante talent gained at 12th level.</p>
			<p><b>Stunning Appearance (Ex) </b>: At 17th level, a vigilante can leave his foes unable to respond when he appears. Whenever a vigilante with this ability makes a successful attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance), the foe must make a successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier) or be stunned until the end of the vigilante&#146;s next turn. If the creature has more HD than the vigilante&#146;s class level, it receives a +4 circumstance bonus on this save. This ability is in addition to the effects of startling appearance and frightening appearance. Once a creature has been the target of this ability (regardless of whether or not the saving throw is successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s stunning appearance for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Vengeance Strike (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>
			<p>At 20th level, a mounted fury need not be mounted while he studies a target against whom he plans a vengeance strike, but he must be mounted when he makes the strike&#146;s attack.</p>

				<name type="string">Dual Identity</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante&#146;s true identity revealed to the world at large.</p>
					<p>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante&#146;s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user&#146;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p>
					<p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante&#146;s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#146;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante&#146;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>
					<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a vigilante must choose to be either an avenger or a stalker.</p>
					<p>An avenger gains a base attack bonus equal to his vigilante level instead of using those listed on Table 1&#150;1. He adds this value to any other base attack bonus gained from other classes or racial Hit Dice as normal.</p>
					<p>A stalker gains an ability called hidden strike, which allows him to deal an extra 1d8 points of precision damage on melee attacks (or ranged attacks from within 30 feet) against foes who are unaware of his presence, who consider him an ally, or who are made flat-footed by startling appearance (see page 17). This extra damage increases by 1d8 at 3rd level and every 2 vigilante levels thereafter. A stalker vigilante can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that he is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage dice are reduced to d4s. A stalker can deal hidden strike damage against targets with concealment (but not total concealment).</p>
					<p>Once this choice is made, it can&#146;t be changed. While many vigilante talents are usable by both specializations, some are unique to each specialization. A stalker vigilante can apply only one talent marked with an asterisk (*) to a given hidden strike, and only when that hidden strike is dealt against a foe that is unaware of the stalker vigilante&#146;s presence (or who considers him an ally), unless otherwise noted.</p>

					<p>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>In the wake of Ileosa&#146;s death, some of the surviving Gray Maidens attempted to return to their former lives&#151;a task made difficult by the physical and emotional scars of their indoctrination. For a few, suppressing the indoctrination&#146;s effects seemed to work. In time, though, the repressed aspects returned, pushing these former conscripts to don their armor and seek out conflict. These so-called masked maidens find themselves leading a double life: ordinary (albeit troubled) citizen by day, faceless warrior by night. In the most tragic cases, the identities entirely disassociate, with the maiden experiencing unexplained exhaustion and injuries upon awakening.</i></p>
			<p><i>While their social identities cover a wide range of personality types, in their vigilante identities, masked maidens are usually icy and dispassionate. These identities are rarely good-aligned, and are more often merciless bringers of justice than gentle redeemers. Some masked maidens continue enforcing the queen&#146;s cruel agenda, while others fight crime or pursue personal vendettas. A masked maiden always uses the iconic Gray Maiden helm when in her vigilante identity, as these helms serve excellently at both hiding the vigilante&#146;s identity while simultaneously evoking the significant social gravitas associated with the Gray Maidens. Often, the masked maiden wears signature garb, such as a helm with a distinctively colored plume or a scarlike etching on the helm&#146;s face, or perhaps a unique cloak. Although the masked maiden hides behind the armor and is pursuing her goals, she wants to be able to be identified as a specific individual.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Life can be unfair. Think of the starving peasants forced to toil for the local baron or the common laborers tasked with building the king&#146;s newest palace for a mere handful of copper pieces each week. There are those who see these injustices and do nothing. There are those who are willing to reap the rewards obtained through the suffering of others. Then there are those who see inequality and find themselves driven to take action, outside the law if necessary. These vigilantes operate in plain sight, hiding behind respectable personas by day, but donning alternate guises by night to right the wrongs they see all around them.</p>
			<p>Not all vigilantes are out to make the world a better place. Some criminals hide behind the pretense of being ordinary folk, only to become terrors in the shadows, stealing and killing to fulfill some dark agenda. In either case, the vigilante is a character of two natures&#151;the face that everyone knows and the mask that inspires fear.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A vigilante can take on many tasks within a group. Most are skilled at negotiating delicate social situations and courtly intrigue, but they can also serve as stealthy spies or even brutish warriors in dangerous environments.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Vigilante's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Abilities</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Vigilantes are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). All masked maiden vigilantes are proficient with Gray Maiden plate armor (see page 84), but not with any other forms of heavy armor.</p>
			<p><b>Dual Identity (Ex): </b>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante&#146;s true identity revealed to the world at large.</p>
			<p>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante&#146;s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user&#146;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p>
			<p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante&#146;s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#146;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante&#146;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>
			<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>
			<p><b>Imperfect Control (Ex): </b>A masked maiden compulsively resists entering her indoctrinated state, but certain triggers (such as violence) can cause her to lapse. The masked maiden always starts the day in her social identity. To begin willingly changing to her vigilante identity, the masked maiden must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half her vigilante level); if she fails, she becomes shaken for 1 minute and cannot try again during that time. While in her social identity, when the masked maiden is exposed to mortal peril (such as when combat starts), she must succeed at a Will save at the same DC or be compelled to enter her vigilante identity as soon as she can get out of sight to do so. The masked maiden cannot choose to fail this Will save. In addition, if the masked maiden hasn&#146;t entered her vigilante identity for a week or longer, she must attempt this Will save at the start of each day; on a failure, she is compelled to change into her vigilante identity immediately (or as soon as she can slip out of sight to do so).</p>
			<p>A masked maiden can don Gray Maiden plate in 1 minute without aid, and can do so as part of switching to her vigilante identity. If the maiden reduces the time it takes to change identities (such as with the quick change social talent), she can still don her armor as part of changing to her vigilante identity. A masked maiden who changes to her vigilante identity unwillingly can&#146;t choose to switch from her vigilante identity back to her social identity that day. While in her vigilante identity, the masked maiden takes a &#150;2 penalty on all Charisma-based ability and skill checks (except for Intimidate) and can&#146;t benefit from morale bonuses or bardic performances.</p>
			<p>This ability alters dual identity.</p>
			<p><b>Scars of the Past (Ex): </b>A masked maiden must choose avenger as her vigilante specialization. A 1st-level masked maiden gains a set of Gray Maiden plate at no cost. This armor is battered, and other creatures are never considered proficient with it. This armor can be sold only as scrap for 4d6 gp, but for the masked maiden the armor functions normally. The masked maiden can spend 150 gp and 1 day of work to improve her battered armor to masterwork quality (although it is still considered battered).</p>
			<p>This ability replaces seamless guise.</p>
			<p><b>Social Talent: </b>Starting at 1st level, and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a social talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet other prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as having another social talent or attaining a minimum vigilante level. Once a talent has been chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Specialization (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a vigilante must choose to be either an avenger or a stalker.</p>
			<p>An avenger gains a base attack bonus equal to his vigilante level instead of using those listed on Table 1&#150;1. He adds this value to any other base attack bonus gained from other classes or racial Hit Dice as normal.</p>
			<p>A stalker gains an ability called hidden strike, which allows him to deal an extra 1d8 points of precision damage on melee attacks (or ranged attacks from within 30 feet) against foes who are unaware of his presence, who consider him an ally, or who are made flat-footed by startling appearance (see page 17). This extra damage increases by 1d8 at 3rd level and every 2 vigilante levels thereafter. A stalker vigilante can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that he is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage dice are reduced to d4s. A stalker can deal hidden strike damage against targets with concealment (but not total concealment).</p>
			<p>Once this choice is made, it can&#146;t be changed. While many vigilante talents are usable by both specializations, some are unique to each specialization. A stalker vigilante can apply only one talent marked with an asterisk (*) to a given hidden strike, and only when that hidden strike is dealt against a foe that is unaware of the stalker vigilante&#146;s presence (or who considers him an ally), unless otherwise noted.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Talent: </b>Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a vigilante talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as possessing another vigilante talent, possessing a particular specialization, or attaining a minimum level. Once a talent has been selected, it can&#146;t be changed.</p>
			<p>If the vigilante uses any of these talents while in his social identity, he must succeed at a Disguise check against the Perception checks of all onlookers (without the +20 circumstance bonus from seamless guise) or the onlookers will realize that he is more than his social identity appears to be and perhaps discover the social and vigilante identities are one and the same. If a talent calls for a saving throw, the DC for that save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s level + the vigilante&#146;s Charisma modifier, unless stated otherwise.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Training (Ex): </b>All Gray Maidens were drilled in the use of their armor, and as a masked maiden continues to lapse in and out of indoctrination, that training emerges slowly from her subconscious. At 3rd level, a masked maiden gains the fighter&#146;s armor training class feature, and at 19th level she gains armor mastery. She treats her vigilante level as her fighter level for the purposes of both.</p>
			<p>This replaces the vigilante&#146;s social talents gained at 3rd, 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Unshakable (Ex): </b>Starting at 3rd level, a vigilante adds his class level to the DC of any attempts to Intimidate him.</p>
			<p><b>Startling Appearance (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a vigilante learns to use the element of surprise to his advantage, startling foes that are unaware of his presence. Whenever a vigilante with this ability attempts an attack against a foe that is completely unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (usually due to Stealth or invisibility), the foe is treated as flat-footed for the rest of the vigilante&#146;s turn (uncanny dodge or a similar ability prevents this effect unless the vigilante is at least 4 levels higher than the foe with uncanny dodge). The foe also takes a &#150;4 penalty on attacks made against the vigilante until the start of the vigilante&#146;s next turn.</p>
			<p><b>Frightening Appearance (Ex): </b>At 11th level, whenever a vigilante with this ability makes an attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance above), the vigilante can, as a free action, attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of his attack and any enemies within 10 feet who can see the attack. This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets. If the check succeeds against the target of the vigilante&#146;s attack, that foe is also frightened for 1 round, in addition to being shaken as normal, unless the foe succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier).</p>
			<p>Once a creature has been the target of this ability (either as the target of the attack or as a nearby creature, regardless of whether or not it was successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s frightening appearance for 24 hours. This effect is in addition to the bonuses gained from the startling appearance ability. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Stunning Appearance (Ex) </b>: At 17th level, a vigilante can leave his foes unable to respond when he appears. Whenever a vigilante with this ability makes a successful attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance), the foe must make a successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier) or be stunned until the end of the vigilante&#146;s next turn. If the creature has more HD than the vigilante&#146;s class level, it receives a +4 circumstance bonus on this save. This ability is in addition to the effects of startling appearance and frightening appearance. Once a creature has been the target of this ability (regardless of whether or not the saving throw is successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s stunning appearance for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Vengeance Strike (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>

Whenever a vigilante with this ability attempts an attack against a foe that is completely unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (usually due to Stealth or invisibility), the foe is treated as flat-footed for the rest of the vigilante&#146;s turn (uncanny dodge or a similar ability prevents this effect unless the vigilante is at least 4 levels higher than the foe with uncanny dodge).

					<p>At 11th level, whenever a vigilante with this ability makes an attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance above), the vigilante can, as a free action, attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of his attack and any enemies within 10 feet who can see the attack. This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets. If the check succeeds against the target of the vigilante&#146;s attack, that foe is also frightened for 1 round, in addition to being shaken as normal, unless the foe succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier).</p>
					<p>Once a creature has been the target of this ability (either as the target of the attack or as a nearby creature, regardless of whether or not it was successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s frightening appearance for 24 hours. This effect is in addition to the bonuses gained from the startling appearance ability. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>

If the creature has more HD than the vigilante&#146;s class level, it receives a +4 circumstance bonus on this save. This ability is in addition to the effects of startling appearance and frightening appearance.

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>

However, the transformation is quite a spectacle, involving loud sounds or music, brilliant colorful energies, and swift motions.</p>

The familiar also has a social identity as a seemingly normal animal, though vigilantes with outlandish familiars might still need to hide the familiar.</p>
					<p>At 3rd level, the magical child&#146;s familiar reveals another aspect of its form, and its vigilante identity changes into a creature on the Improved Familiar list that would be available to a 3rd-level spellcaster (the animal guide&#146;s social identity always remains as the original normal animal). The familiar can change its vigilante identity again when the magical child reaches 5th and 7th level, each time to familiars available at those levels. The Improved Familiar feat&#146;s alignment restrictions apply to this ability, but only the magical child&#146;s vigilante identity needs to have an alignment that fulfills the alignment requirements of the improved familiar. The familiar&#146;s new vigilante form choices are permanent, and it cannot transform back into its former vigilante identities until 9th level, when the familiar gains the change shape universal monster ability if it doesn&#146;t already have it. It can use this ability at will when in its vigilante identity to transform into any of its four vigilante identities.

To do so, she must conduct an 8-hour ritual that costs 200 gp per her vigilante level, but once the ritual is complete, the familiar returns in a new body. It retains all of its memories from its earlier service to the magical child.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some vigilantes, no matter their age, carry a spark of capricious whimsy under which flows a powerful current of magic and wonder. They keep these wondrous abilities secret, though they are aided in their endeavors by creatures just as magical as they are.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Life can be unfair. Think of the starving peasants forced to toil for the local baron or the common laborers tasked with building the king&#146;s newest palace for a mere handful of copper pieces each week. There are those who see these injustices and do nothing. There are those who are willing to reap the rewards obtained through the suffering of others. Then there are those who see inequality and find themselves driven to take action, outside the law if necessary. These vigilantes operate in plain sight, hiding behind respectable personas by day, but donning alternate guises by night to right the wrongs they see all around them.</p>
			<p>Not all vigilantes are out to make the world a better place. Some criminals hide behind the pretense of being ordinary folk, only to become terrors in the shadows, stealing and killing to fulfill some dark agenda. In either case, the vigilante is a character of two natures&#151;the face that everyone knows and the mask that inspires fear.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A vigilante can take on many tasks within a group. Most are skilled at negotiating delicate social situations and courtly intrigue, but they can also serve as stealthy spies or even brutish warriors in dangerous environments.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Vigilante's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

It retains all of its memories from its earlier service to the magical child.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces vigilante specialization.</p>
			<p><b>Dual Identity (Ex): </b>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante&#146;s true identity revealed to the world at large.</p>
			<p>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante&#146;s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user&#146;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p>
			<p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante&#146;s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#146;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante&#146;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>
			<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>
			<p><b>Spellcasting: </b>A magical child casts arcane spells and cantrips as an unchained summoner. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time, assuming she has not yet used up her allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level, and she chooses her spells known from the summoner spell list (she cannot choose spells that would affect an eidolon). A magical child&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited; use Table 1&#150;5: Summoner Spells Known on page 27 of Pathfinder RPG Pathfinder Unchained to determine how many spells the magical child knows at each level. A magical child needs to commune with her animal guide for 1 hour in order to replenish her daily spell slots.</p>
			<p>This replaces the 4th-, 8th-, 10th-, 14th-, and 16th-level vigilante talents.</p>
			<p><b>Transformation Sequence (Su): </b>A magical child&#146;s transformation between identities is assisted by magic. This makes it faster than usual, but also more noticeable. A magical child can normally transform between her identities in 5 rounds, though this improves to a standard action with the quick change social talent and a swift action with the immediate change social talent. However, the transformation is quite a spectacle, involving loud sounds or music, brilliant colorful energies, and swift motions.</p>
			<p><b>Seamless Guise (Ex) </b>: A vigilante knows how to behave in a way that appears perfectly proper and normal for his current identity. Should anyone suspect him of being anything other than what he appears to be while either in his social or vigilante identity, he can attempt a Disguise check with a +20 circumstance bonus to appear as his current identity, and not as his other identity.</p>
			<p><b>Social Talent: </b>Starting at 1st level, and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a social talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet other prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as having another social talent or attaining a minimum vigilante level. Once a talent has been chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Staunch Ally (Ex): </b>A magical child&#146;s familiar counts as the magical child for purposes of the startling appearance, frightening appearance, and stunning appearance abilities, and it can calculate its DCs using either its own Charisma modifier or the magical child&#146;s, whichever is better. At 20th level, the familiar can make vengeance strikes as if it were the magical child.</p>
			<p>This ability alters startling appearance, frightening appearance, stunning appearance, and vengeance strike.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Specialization (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a vigilante must choose to be either an avenger or a stalker.</p>
			<p>An avenger gains a base attack bonus equal to his vigilante level instead of using those listed on Table 1&#150;1. He adds this value to any other base attack bonus gained from other classes or racial Hit Dice as normal.</p>
			<p>A stalker gains an ability called hidden strike, which allows him to deal an extra 1d8 points of precision damage on melee attacks (or ranged attacks from within 30 feet) against foes who are unaware of his presence, who consider him an ally, or who are made flat-footed by startling appearance (see page 17). This extra damage increases by 1d8 at 3rd level and every 2 vigilante levels thereafter. A stalker vigilante can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that he is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage dice are reduced to d4s. A stalker can deal hidden strike damage against targets with concealment (but not total concealment).</p>
			<p>Once this choice is made, it can&#146;t be changed. While many vigilante talents are usable by both specializations, some are unique to each specialization. A stalker vigilante can apply only one talent marked with an asterisk (*) to a given hidden strike, and only when that hidden strike is dealt against a foe that is unaware of the stalker vigilante&#146;s presence (or who considers him an ally), unless otherwise noted.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Talent: </b>Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a vigilante talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as possessing another vigilante talent, possessing a particular specialization, or attaining a minimum level. Once a talent has been selected, it can&#146;t be changed.</p>
			<p>If the vigilante uses any of these talents while in his social identity, he must succeed at a Disguise check against the Perception checks of all onlookers (without the +20 circumstance bonus from seamless guise) or the onlookers will realize that he is more than his social identity appears to be and perhaps discover the social and vigilante identities are one and the same. If a talent calls for a saving throw, the DC for that save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s level + the vigilante&#146;s Charisma modifier, unless stated otherwise.</p>
			<p><b>Unshakable (Ex): </b>Starting at 3rd level, a vigilante adds his class level to the DC of any attempts to Intimidate him.</p>
			<p><b>Startling Appearance (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a vigilante learns to use the element of surprise to his advantage, startling foes that are unaware of his presence. Whenever a vigilante with this ability attempts an attack against a foe that is completely unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (usually due to Stealth or invisibility), the foe is treated as flat-footed for the rest of the vigilante&#146;s turn (uncanny dodge or a similar ability prevents this effect unless the vigilante is at least 4 levels higher than the foe with uncanny dodge). The foe also takes a &#150;4 penalty on attacks made against the vigilante until the start of the vigilante&#146;s next turn.</p>
			<p><b>Frightening Appearance (Ex): </b>At 11th level, whenever a vigilante with this ability makes an attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance above), the vigilante can, as a free action, attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of his attack and any enemies within 10 feet who can see the attack. This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets. If the check succeeds against the target of the vigilante&#146;s attack, that foe is also frightened for 1 round, in addition to being shaken as normal, unless the foe succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier).</p>
			<p>Once a creature has been the target of this ability (either as the target of the attack or as a nearby creature, regardless of whether or not it was successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s frightening appearance for 24 hours. This effect is in addition to the bonuses gained from the startling appearance ability. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Stunning Appearance (Ex) </b>: At 17th level, a vigilante can leave his foes unable to respond when he appears. Whenever a vigilante with this ability makes a successful attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance), the foe must make a successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier) or be stunned until the end of the vigilante&#146;s next turn. If the creature has more HD than the vigilante&#146;s class level, it receives a +4 circumstance bonus on this save. This ability is in addition to the effects of startling appearance and frightening appearance. Once a creature has been the target of this ability (regardless of whether or not the saving throw is successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s stunning appearance for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Vengeance Strike (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>

The imperial agent gains a +20 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to impersonate a member of that faction against creatures who are unaffiliated with that faction, potentially allowing the imperial agent to pin the blame for his actions on the faction he was impersonating. However, the imperial agent receives no bonus and a &#150;10 penalty on Disguise checks against members of the faction he is impersonating. An imperial agent can choose a different faction each time he uses this ability.

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, an imperial agent becomes an expert at spreading malicious rumors in order to foment chaos and strife to further his aims. Slandering an individual or organization takes 1d4 days in a settlement smaller than a town, or 1 week in a town or larger settlement. The imperial agent must succeed at either a Bluff or Diplomacy check. If the general populace is indifferent towards the target of the slander, the DC of this check is 20 + the target&#146;s Charisma modifier. For each step above indifferent the public&#146;s attitude towards the target is, the DC increases by 5, and for each step below indifferent the public&#146;s attitude towards the target is, the DC decreases by 5. If the imperial agent is successful, the public&#146;s attitude toward his target is decreased by 1 step. If the imperial agent fails the check, however, he cannot affect the settlement with this ability for 1 week, and the target of his slander becomes aware that someone is spreading malicious rumors. The GM determines the exact effects of the public&#146;s shift in attitude. Even if the public is hostile toward the target, they might not act openly against the target, especially if doing so might be dangerous.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Many residents of Lung Wa&#146;s successor states refuse to admit the empire has truly fallen, but the self-proclaimed imperial agents have taken matters into their own hands. Imperial agents are often the descendants of nobility and generals from Lung Wa, devoted to reuniting the empire by conquering Lung Wa&#146;s successor states. Often forming secret networks with fanciful names, they focus on destabilizing nations with blackmail, slander, and treachery.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Life can be unfair. Think of the starving peasants forced to toil for the local baron or the common laborers tasked with building the king&#146;s newest palace for a mere handful of copper pieces each week. There are those who see these injustices and do nothing. There are those who are willing to reap the rewards obtained through the suffering of others. Then there are those who see inequality and find themselves driven to take action, outside the law if necessary. These vigilantes operate in plain sight, hiding behind respectable personas by day, but donning alternate guises by night to right the wrongs they see all around them.</p>
			<p>Not all vigilantes are out to make the world a better place. Some criminals hide behind the pretense of being ordinary folk, only to become terrors in the shadows, stealing and killing to fulfill some dark agenda. In either case, the vigilante is a character of two natures&#151;the face that everyone knows and the mask that inspires fear.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A vigilante can take on many tasks within a group. Most are skilled at negotiating delicate social situations and courtly intrigue, but they can also serve as stealthy spies or even brutish warriors in dangerous environments.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Vigilante's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Abilities</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Vigilantes are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Dual Identity (Ex): </b>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante&#146;s true identity revealed to the world at large.</p>
			<p>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante&#146;s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user&#146;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p>
			<p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante&#146;s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#146;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante&#146;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>
			<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>
			<p><b>Seamless Guise (Ex) </b>: A vigilante knows how to behave in a way that appears perfectly proper and normal for his current identity. Should anyone suspect him of being anything other than what he appears to be while either in his social or vigilante identity, he can attempt a Disguise check with a +20 circumstance bonus to appear as his current identity, and not as his other identity.</p>
			<p><b>Slander (Ex): </b>At 1st level, an imperial agent becomes an expert at spreading malicious rumors in order to foment chaos and strife to further his aims. Slandering an individual or organization takes 1d4 days in a settlement smaller than a town, or 1 week in a town or larger settlement. The imperial agent must succeed at either a Bluff or Diplomacy check. If the general populace is indifferent towards the target of the slander, the DC of this check is 20 + the target&#146;s Charisma modifier. For each step above indifferent the public&#146;s attitude towards the target is, the DC increases by 5, and for each step below indifferent the public&#146;s attitude towards the target is, the DC decreases by 5. If the imperial agent is successful, the public&#146;s attitude toward his target is decreased by 1 step. If the imperial agent fails the check, however, he cannot affect the settlement with this ability for 1 week, and the target of his slander becomes aware that someone is spreading malicious rumors. The GM determines the exact effects of the public&#146;s shift in attitude. Even if the public is hostile toward the target, they might not act openly against the target, especially if doing so might be dangerous.</p>
			<p>This replaces the social talent gained at 1st level.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Specialization (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a vigilante must choose to be either an avenger or a stalker.</p>
			<p>An avenger gains a base attack bonus equal to his vigilante level instead of using those listed on Table 1&#150;1. He adds this value to any other base attack bonus gained from other classes or racial Hit Dice as normal.</p>
			<p>A stalker gains an ability called hidden strike, which allows him to deal an extra 1d8 points of precision damage on melee attacks (or ranged attacks from within 30 feet) against foes who are unaware of his presence, who consider him an ally, or who are made flat-footed by startling appearance (see page 17). This extra damage increases by 1d8 at 3rd level and every 2 vigilante levels thereafter. A stalker vigilante can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that he is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage dice are reduced to d4s. A stalker can deal hidden strike damage against targets with concealment (but not total concealment).</p>
			<p>Once this choice is made, it can&#146;t be changed. While many vigilante talents are usable by both specializations, some are unique to each specialization. A stalker vigilante can apply only one talent marked with an asterisk (*) to a given hidden strike, and only when that hidden strike is dealt against a foe that is unaware of the stalker vigilante&#146;s presence (or who considers him an ally), unless otherwise noted.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Talent: </b>Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a vigilante talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as possessing another vigilante talent, possessing a particular specialization, or attaining a minimum level. Once a talent has been selected, it can&#146;t be changed.</p>
			<p>If the vigilante uses any of these talents while in his social identity, he must succeed at a Disguise check against the Perception checks of all onlookers (without the +20 circumstance bonus from seamless guise) or the onlookers will realize that he is more than his social identity appears to be and perhaps discover the social and vigilante identities are one and the same. If a talent calls for a saving throw, the DC for that save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s level + the vigilante&#146;s Charisma modifier, unless stated otherwise.</p>
			<p><b>Manipulative (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, an imperial agent is a master of blackmail, extortion, and subterfuge. He gains a bonus equal to 1/2 his vigilante level on Bluff checks (except those to feint) and on Intimidate checks (except those to demoralize an opponent).</p>
			<p>This replaces unshakable.</p>
			<p><b>Social Talent: </b>Starting at 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter (execpt 5th), a vigilante gains a social talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet other prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as having another social talent or attaining a minimum vigilante level. Once a talent has been chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>False Flag (Ex): </b>At 5th level, whenever an imperial agent changes his identity, he has a third option (instead of social or vigilante) he can wear a false flag. This functions identically to the many guises social talent, except that the false flag identity is associated with a particular nation, organization, or other faction. The imperial agent gains a +20 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to impersonate a member of that faction against creatures who are unaffiliated with that faction, potentially allowing the imperial agent to pin the blame for his actions on the faction he was impersonating. However, the imperial agent receives no bonus and a &#150;10 penalty on Disguise checks against members of the faction he is impersonating. An imperial agent can choose a different faction each time he uses this ability. Factions that lack a flag, uniform, or other symbol of membership may be difficult or impossible to impersonate, at the GM&#146;s discretion.</p>
			<p>This replaces the social talent gained at 5th level.</p>
			<p><b>Startling Appearance (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a vigilante learns to use the element of surprise to his advantage, startling foes that are unaware of his presence. Whenever a vigilante with this ability attempts an attack against a foe that is completely unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (usually due to Stealth or invisibility), the foe is treated as flat-footed for the rest of the vigilante&#146;s turn (uncanny dodge or a similar ability prevents this effect unless the vigilante is at least 4 levels higher than the foe with uncanny dodge). The foe also takes a &#150;4 penalty on attacks made against the vigilante until the start of the vigilante&#146;s next turn.</p>
			<p><b>Frightening Appearance (Ex): </b>At 11th level, whenever a vigilante with this ability makes an attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance above), the vigilante can, as a free action, attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of his attack and any enemies within 10 feet who can see the attack. This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets. If the check succeeds against the target of the vigilante&#146;s attack, that foe is also frightened for 1 round, in addition to being shaken as normal, unless the foe succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier).</p>
			<p>Once a creature has been the target of this ability (either as the target of the attack or as a nearby creature, regardless of whether or not it was successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s frightening appearance for 24 hours. This effect is in addition to the bonuses gained from the startling appearance ability. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Stunning Appearance (Ex) </b>: At 17th level, a vigilante can leave his foes unable to respond when he appears. Whenever a vigilante with this ability makes a successful attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance), the foe must make a successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier) or be stunned until the end of the vigilante&#146;s next turn. If the creature has more HD than the vigilante&#146;s class level, it receives a +4 circumstance bonus on this save. This ability is in addition to the effects of startling appearance and frightening appearance. Once a creature has been the target of this ability (regardless of whether or not the saving throw is successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s stunning appearance for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Vengeance Strike (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>

When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#146;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante&#146;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>
					<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a vigilante must choose to be either an avenger or a stalker.</p>
					<p>An avenger gains a base attack bonus equal to his vigilante level instead of using those listed on Table 1&#150;1. He adds this value to any other base attack bonus gained from other classes or racial Hit Dice as normal.</p>
					<p>A stalker gains an ability called hidden strike, which allows him to deal an extra 1d8 points of precision damage on melee attacks (or ranged attacks from within 30 feet) against foes who are unaware of his presence, who consider him an ally, or who are made flat-footed by startling appearance (see page 17). This extra damage increases by 1d8 at 3rd level and every 2 vigilante levels thereafter. A stalker vigilante can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that he is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage dice are reduced to d4s. A stalker can deal hidden strike damage against targets with concealment (but not total concealment).</p>
					<p>Once this choice is made, it can&#146;t be changed. While many vigilante talents are usable by both specializations, some are unique to each specialization. A stalker vigilante can apply only one talent marked with an asterisk (*) to a given hidden strike, and only when that hidden strike is dealt against a foe that is unaware of the stalker vigilante&#146;s presence (or who considers him an ally), unless otherwise noted.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Sometimes the best place to hide is in plain sight. The hidden current operates above and below the sea. When operating underwater, he blends easily with the locals, passing himself off as one of them or as an experienced aquatic traveler. When operating on land, he erases all traces of his aquatic heritage. When the hidden current needs to avoid pursuit, he slips away into his native environment.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Life can be unfair. Think of the starving peasants forced to toil for the local baron or the common laborers tasked with building the king&#146;s newest palace for a mere handful of copper pieces each week. There are those who see these injustices and do nothing. There are those who are willing to reap the rewards obtained through the suffering of others. Then there are those who see inequality and find themselves driven to take action, outside the law if necessary. These vigilantes operate in plain sight, hiding behind respectable personas by day, but donning alternate guises by night to right the wrongs they see all around them.</p>
			<p>Not all vigilantes are out to make the world a better place. Some criminals hide behind the pretense of being ordinary folk, only to become terrors in the shadows, stealing and killing to fulfill some dark agenda. In either case, the vigilante is a character of two natures&#151;the face that everyone knows and the mask that inspires fear.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A vigilante can take on many tasks within a group. Most are skilled at negotiating delicate social situations and courtly intrigue, but they can also serve as stealthy spies or even brutish warriors in dangerous environments.</p>

			<h>Class Abilities</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Vigilantes are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Dual Identity (Ex): </b>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante&#146;s true identity revealed to the world at large.</p>
			<p>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante&#146;s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user&#146;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p>
			<p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante&#146;s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#146;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante&#146;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>
			<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>
			<p><b>Guise of the Land Walker (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a hidden current gains the many guises social talent, but the mundane identity assumed must be of a nonaquatic humanoid and functions only when he is on land.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the hidden current&#146;s 1st-level social talent.</p>
			<p><b>Seamless Guise (Ex) </b>: A vigilante knows how to behave in a way that appears perfectly proper and normal for his current identity. Should anyone suspect him of being anything other than what he appears to be while either in his social or vigilante identity, he can attempt a Disguise check with a +20 circumstance bonus to appear as his current identity, and not as his other identity.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Specialization (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a vigilante must choose to be either an avenger or a stalker.</p>
			<p>An avenger gains a base attack bonus equal to his vigilante level instead of using those listed on Table 1&#150;1. He adds this value to any other base attack bonus gained from other classes or racial Hit Dice as normal.</p>
			<p>A stalker gains an ability called hidden strike, which allows him to deal an extra 1d8 points of precision damage on melee attacks (or ranged attacks from within 30 feet) against foes who are unaware of his presence, who consider him an ally, or who are made flat-footed by startling appearance (see page 17). This extra damage increases by 1d8 at 3rd level and every 2 vigilante levels thereafter. A stalker vigilante can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that he is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage dice are reduced to d4s. A stalker can deal hidden strike damage against targets with concealment (but not total concealment).</p>
			<p>Once this choice is made, it can&#146;t be changed. While many vigilante talents are usable by both specializations, some are unique to each specialization. A stalker vigilante can apply only one talent marked with an asterisk (*) to a given hidden strike, and only when that hidden strike is dealt against a foe that is unaware of the stalker vigilante&#146;s presence (or who considers him an ally), unless otherwise noted.</p>
			<p><b>Stealthy Swimmer (Ex): </b>Hidden currents can transition between land and sea at a moment&#146;s notice. If a hidden current begins his movement on land and ends his movement in water at least waist deep, or vice versa, he gains a +5 circumstance bonus on a Stealth check in the same turn.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the hidden current&#146;s 2nd-level vigilante talent.</p>
			<p><b>Social Talent: </b>Starting at 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a social talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet other prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as having another social talent or attaining a minimum vigilante level. Once a talent has been chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Unshakable (Ex): </b>Starting at 3rd level, a vigilante adds his class level to the DC of any attempts to Intimidate him.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Talent: </b>Starting at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a vigilante talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as possessing another vigilante talent, possessing a particular specialization, or attaining a minimum level. Once a talent has been selected, it can&#146;t be changed.</p>
			<p>If the vigilante uses any of these talents while in his social identity, he must succeed at a Disguise check against the Perception checks of all onlookers (without the +20 circumstance bonus from seamless guise) or the onlookers will realize that he is more than his social identity appears to be and perhaps discover the social and vigilante identities are one and the same. If a talent calls for a saving throw, the DC for that save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s level + the vigilante&#146;s Charisma modifier, unless stated otherwise.</p>
			<p><b>Startling Appearance (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a vigilante learns to use the element of surprise to his advantage, startling foes that are unaware of his presence. Whenever a vigilante with this ability attempts an attack against a foe that is completely unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (usually due to Stealth or invisibility), the foe is treated as flat-footed for the rest of the vigilante&#146;s turn (uncanny dodge or a similar ability prevents this effect unless the vigilante is at least 4 levels higher than the foe with uncanny dodge). The foe also takes a &#150;4 penalty on attacks made against the vigilante until the start of the vigilante&#146;s next turn.</p>
			<p><b>Sea&#146;s Return (Sp): </b>At 11th level, a hidden current can magically slip between the sea and the land, as if using the spell dimension door with a caster level equal to the hidden current&#146;s vigilante level. The starting point of this ability must be on land and the ending point in water at least waist deep, or vice versa. Using this ability is a move action. The hidden current cannot take other creatures with him when he uses this ability. A hidden current can use this ability once per day at 11th level and an additional time per day every 4 levels thereafter (to a maximum of three uses per day at 19th level).</p>
			<p>This ability replaces frightening appearance.</p>
			<p><b>Stunning Appearance (Ex) </b>: At 17th level, a vigilante can leave his foes unable to respond when he appears. Whenever a vigilante with this ability makes a successful attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance), the foe must make a successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier) or be stunned until the end of the vigilante&#146;s next turn. If the creature has more HD than the vigilante&#146;s class level, it receives a +4 circumstance bonus on this save. This ability is in addition to the effects of startling appearance and frightening appearance. Once a creature has been the target of this ability (regardless of whether or not the saving throw is successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s stunning appearance for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Vengeance Strike (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>

					<p>Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a vigilante talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as possessing another vigilante talent, possessing a particular specialization, or attaining a minimum level. Once a talent has been selected, it can&#146;t be changed.</p>
					<p>If the vigilante uses any of these talents while in his social identity, he must succeed at a Disguise check against the Perception checks of all onlookers (without the +20 circumstance bonus from seamless guise) or the onlookers will realize that he is more than his social identity appears to be and perhaps discover the social and vigilante identities are one and the same. If a talent calls for a saving throw, the DC for that save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s level + the vigilante&#146;s Charisma modifier, unless stated otherwise.</p>

					<p>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Wherever the guilty walk free, the hangman brings judgment.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Life can be unfair. Think of the starving peasants forced to toil for the local baron or the common laborers tasked with building the king&#146;s newest palace for a mere handful of copper pieces each week. There are those who see these injustices and do nothing. There are those who are willing to reap the rewards obtained through the suffering of others. Then there are those who see inequality and find themselves driven to take action, outside the law if necessary. These vigilantes operate in plain sight, hiding behind respectable personas by day, but donning alternate guises by night to right the wrongs they see all around them.</p>
			<p>Not all vigilantes are out to make the world a better place. Some criminals hide behind the pretense of being ordinary folk, only to become terrors in the shadows, stealing and killing to fulfill some dark agenda. In either case, the vigilante is a character of two natures&#151;the face that everyone knows and the mask that inspires fear.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A vigilante can take on many tasks within a group. Most are skilled at negotiating delicate social situations and courtly intrigue, but they can also serve as stealthy spies or even brutish warriors in dangerous environments.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Vigilante's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Abilities</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Vigilantes are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor and medium armor. A hangman is proficient with nets and whips, but not shields.</p>
			<p><b>Dual Identity (Ex): </b>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante&#146;s true identity revealed to the world at large.</p>
			<p>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante&#146;s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user&#146;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p>
			<p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante&#146;s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#146;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante&#146;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>
			<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>
			<p><b>Seamless Guise (Ex) </b>: A vigilante knows how to behave in a way that appears perfectly proper and normal for his current identity. Should anyone suspect him of being anything other than what he appears to be while either in his social or vigilante identity, he can attempt a Disguise check with a +20 circumstance bonus to appear as his current identity, and not as his other identity.</p>
			<p><b>Social Talent: </b>Starting at 1st level, and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a social talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet other prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as having another social talent or attaining a minimum vigilante level. Once a talent has been chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Specialization (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a vigilante must choose to be either an avenger or a stalker.</p>
			<p>A hangman must choose the stalker specialization.</p>
			<p>A stalker gains an ability called hidden strike, which allows him to deal an extra 1d8 points of precision damage on melee attacks (or ranged attacks from within 30 feet) against foes who are unaware of his presence, who consider him an ally, or who are made flat-footed by startling appearance (see page 17). This extra damage increases by 1d8 at 3rd level and every 2 vigilante levels thereafter. A stalker vigilante can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that he is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage dice are reduced to d4s. A stalker can deal hidden strike damage against targets with concealment (but not total concealment).</p>
			<p>Once this choice is made, it can&#146;t be changed. While many vigilante talents are usable by both specializations, some are unique to each specialization. A stalker vigilante can apply only one talent marked with an asterisk (*) to a given hidden strike, and only when that hidden strike is dealt against a foe that is unaware of the stalker vigilante&#146;s presence (or who considers him an ally), unless otherwise noted.</p>
			<p><b>Hangman's Noose (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hangman can wield a rope noose as a net or whip, and also can use it to grapple, gaining the benefits of Improved Grapple with it. He takes no penalty on combat maneuver checks with the noose for having the noose in his hand, but he still doesn&#146;t add any bonuses he might have with a net or whip (such as weapon enhancement bonuses or benefits from Weapon Focus) on the check. He can spend 1 minute to weave a magical or masterwork net or whip into a noose, thereafter gaining these benefits with it.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the 2nd-level vigilante talent.</p>
			<p><b>Bound to Truth (Ex, Sp): </b>At 3rd level, a hangman adds half his vigilante level to his Sense Motive checks to notice lies told by a creature entangled or grappled by his noose, by feeling the creature&#146;s throat clench or changes in its breathing. In addition, he can prevent a creature entangled or grappled in his noose from lying by tightening the noose, as per a single-target zone of truth (the caster level equals his vigilante level; the save DC is Charisma-based). He can use the latter ability a number of rounds per day equal to half his vigilante level. These rounds don&#146;t need to be consecutive.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces unshakable.</p>
			<p><b>Twisted Rope (Su): </b>At 4th level, a hangman can spend 1 hour preparing his noose, granting it temporary hit points equal to his vigilante level, giving it a hardness equal to 1/2 his vigilante level plus double the weapon&#146;s enhancement bonus (or its current hardness, whichever is better), and changing its break DC to 23 + 1/2 his vigilante level (or its current break DC, whichever is better). These benefits last for 8 hours, but end immediately if the hangman prepares another noose.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the 4th-level vigilante talent.</p>
			<p><b>Chokehold: </b>At 5th level, a hangman gains ChokeholdUC as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces startling appearance.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Talent: </b>Starting at 6th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a vigilante talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as possessing another vigilante talent, possessing a particular specialization, or attaining a minimum level. Once a talent has been selected, it can&#146;t be changed.</p>
			<p>If the vigilante uses any of these talents while in his social identity, he must succeed at a Disguise check against the Perception checks of all onlookers (without the +20 circumstance bonus from seamless guise) or the onlookers will realize that he is more than his social identity appears to be and perhaps discover the social and vigilante identities are one and the same. If a talent calls for a saving throw, the DC for that save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s level + the vigilante&#146;s Charisma modifier, unless stated otherwise.</p>
			<p><b>Tighten the Noose (Ex): </b>At 11th level, while a hangman is grappling a target with his noose, as a swift action he can deal increased hidden strike damage to the target.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces frightening appearance.</p>
			<p><b>Suffocation (Ex): </b>At 17th level, the first time the hangman succeeds at a check to maintain a grapple (on his next turn after establishing the grapple), in place of the other options, he can suffocate the target and cause her to fall unconscious. A successful Fortitude save (DC = 15 + the hangman&#146;s Strength bonus) negates the suffocation. On subsequent rounds, the hangman can maintain the grapple to suffocate the target again. On the next failed save, the target drops to &#150;1 hit points and starts dying. On the third failed save, she dies. Even if the hangman has the ability to maintain a grapple with less than a standard action, he can attempt to maintain a grapple to suffocate only once per round.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces stunning appearance.</p>
			<p><b>Vengeance Strike (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>

				<name type="string">Vigilante Specialization</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a vigilante must choose to be either an avenger or a stalker.</p>
					<p>An avenger gains a base attack bonus equal to his vigilante level instead of using those listed on Table 1&#150;1. He adds this value to any other base attack bonus gained from other classes or racial Hit Dice as normal.</p>
					<p>A stalker gains an ability called hidden strike, which allows him to deal an extra 1d8 points of precision damage on melee attacks (or ranged attacks from within 30 feet) against foes who are unaware of his presence, who consider him an ally, or who are made flat-footed by startling appearance (see page 17). This extra damage increases by 1d8 at 3rd level and every 2 vigilante levels thereafter. A stalker vigilante can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that he is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage dice are reduced to d4s. A stalker can deal hidden strike damage against targets with concealment (but not total concealment).</p>
					<p>Once this choice is made, it can&#146;t be changed. While many vigilante talents are usable by both specializations, some are unique to each specialization. A stalker vigilante can apply only one talent marked with an asterisk (*) to a given hidden strike, and only when that hidden strike is dealt against a foe that is unaware of the stalker vigilante&#146;s presence (or who considers him an ally), unless otherwise noted.</p>

This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets. If the check succeeds against the target of the vigilante&#146;s attack, that foe is also frightened for 1 round, in addition to being shaken as normal, unless the foe succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier).</p>

On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Many half-elves who live in human or elven societies try to blend in, hiding their true ancestry. But deception takes a toll, and some half-elves form alternate identities to let the suppressed side of their heritage be known. This other identity can be either a force for good, enabling the half-elf to express a part of himself that has been denied to him, or for evil, with the half-elf hurting others to make up for his own pain.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Life can be unfair. Think of the starving peasants forced to toil for the local baron or the common laborers tasked with building the king&#146;s newest palace for a mere handful of copper pieces each week. There are those who see these injustices and do nothing. There are those who are willing to reap the rewards obtained through the suffering of others. Then there are those who see inequality and find themselves driven to take action, outside the law if necessary. These vigilantes operate in plain sight, hiding behind respectable personas by day, but donning alternate guises by night to right the wrongs they see all around them.</p>
			<p>Not all vigilantes are out to make the world a better place. Some criminals hide behind the pretense of being ordinary folk, only to become terrors in the shadows, stealing and killing to fulfill some dark agenda. In either case, the vigilante is a character of two natures&#151;the face that everyone knows and the mask that inspires fear.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A vigilante can take on many tasks within a group. Most are skilled at negotiating delicate social situations and courtly intrigue, but they can also serve as stealthy spies or even brutish warriors in dangerous environments.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Vigilante's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Abilities</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Vigilantes are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Dual Identity (Ex): </b>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante&#146;s true identity revealed to the world at large.</p>
			<p>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante&#146;s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user&#146;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p>
			<p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante&#146;s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#146;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante&#146;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>
			<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>
			<p><b>Seamless Guise (Ex) </b>: A vigilante knows how to behave in a way that appears perfectly proper and normal for his current identity. Should anyone suspect him of being anything other than what he appears to be while either in his social or vigilante identity, he can attempt a Disguise check with a +20 circumstance bonus to appear as his current identity, and not as his other identity.</p>
			<p><b>Social Talent: </b>Starting at 1st level, and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a social talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet other prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as having another social talent or attaining a minimum vigilante level. Once a talent has been chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Specialization (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a vigilante must choose to be either an avenger or a stalker.</p>
			<p>An avenger gains a base attack bonus equal to his vigilante level instead of using those listed on Table 1&#150;1. He adds this value to any other base attack bonus gained from other classes or racial Hit Dice as normal.</p>
			<p>A stalker gains an ability called hidden strike, which allows him to deal an extra 1d8 points of precision damage on melee attacks (or ranged attacks from within 30 feet) against foes who are unaware of his presence, who consider him an ally, or who are made flat-footed by startling appearance (see page 17). This extra damage increases by 1d8 at 3rd level and every 2 vigilante levels thereafter. A stalker vigilante can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that he is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage dice are reduced to d4s. A stalker can deal hidden strike damage against targets with concealment (but not total concealment).</p>
			<p>Once this choice is made, it can&#146;t be changed. While many vigilante talents are usable by both specializations, some are unique to each specialization. A stalker vigilante can apply only one talent marked with an asterisk (*) to a given hidden strike, and only when that hidden strike is dealt against a foe that is unaware of the stalker vigilante&#146;s presence (or who considers him an ally), unless otherwise noted.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Talent: </b>Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a vigilante talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as possessing another vigilante talent, possessing a particular specialization, or attaining a minimum level. Once a talent has been selected, it can&#146;t be changed.</p>
			<p>If the vigilante uses any of these talents while in his social identity, he must succeed at a Disguise check against the Perception checks of all onlookers (without the +20 circumstance bonus from seamless guise) or the onlookers will realize that he is more than his social identity appears to be and perhaps discover the social and vigilante identities are one and the same. If a talent calls for a saving throw, the DC for that save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s level + the vigilante&#146;s Charisma modifier, unless stated otherwise.</p>
			<p><b>Unshakable (Ex): </b>Starting at 3rd level, a vigilante adds his class level to the DC of any attempts to Intimidate him.</p>
			<p><b>Startling Appearance (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a vigilante learns to use the element of surprise to his advantage, startling foes that are unaware of his presence. Whenever a vigilante with this ability attempts an attack against a foe that is completely unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (usually due to Stealth or invisibility), the foe is treated as flat-footed for the rest of the vigilante&#146;s turn (uncanny dodge or a similar ability prevents this effect unless the vigilante is at least 4 levels higher than the foe with uncanny dodge). The foe also takes a &#150;4 penalty on attacks made against the vigilante until the start of the vigilante&#146;s next turn.</p>
			<p><b>Frightening Appearance (Ex): </b>At 11th level, whenever a vigilante with this ability makes an attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance above), the vigilante can, as a free action, attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of his attack and any enemies within 10 feet who can see the attack. This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets. If the check succeeds against the target of the vigilante&#146;s attack, that foe is also frightened for 1 round, in addition to being shaken as normal, unless the foe succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier).</p>
			<p>Once a creature has been the target of this ability (either as the target of the attack or as a nearby creature, regardless of whether or not it was successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s frightening appearance for 24 hours. This effect is in addition to the bonuses gained from the startling appearance ability. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Stunning Appearance (Ex) </b>: At 17th level, a vigilante can leave his foes unable to respond when he appears. Whenever a vigilante with this ability makes a successful attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance), the foe must make a successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier) or be stunned until the end of the vigilante&#146;s next turn. If the creature has more HD than the vigilante&#146;s class level, it receives a +4 circumstance bonus on this save. This ability is in addition to the effects of startling appearance and frightening appearance. Once a creature has been the target of this ability (regardless of whether or not the saving throw is successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s stunning appearance for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Vengeance Strike (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>

				<name type="string">Dual Identity</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante&#146;s true identity revealed to the world at large.</p>
					<p>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante&#146;s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user&#146;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p>
					<p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante&#146;s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#146;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante&#146;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>
					<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Firearms can be potent tools for striking fear into the hearts of enemies, and canny vigilantes use this to their advantage. Gunmasters brandish firearms like extensions of their will, taking down their foes with deadly accuracy and skill.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Life can be unfair. Think of the starving peasants forced to toil for the local baron or the common laborers tasked with building the king&#146;s newest palace for a mere handful of copper pieces each week. There are those who see these injustices and do nothing. There are those who are willing to reap the rewards obtained through the suffering of others. Then there are those who see inequality and find themselves driven to take action, outside the law if necessary. These vigilantes operate in plain sight, hiding behind respectable personas by day, but donning alternate guises by night to right the wrongs they see all around them.</p>
			<p>Not all vigilantes are out to make the world a better place. Some criminals hide behind the pretense of being ordinary folk, only to become terrors in the shadows, stealing and killing to fulfill some dark agenda. In either case, the vigilante is a character of two natures&#151;the face that everyone knows and the mask that inspires fear.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A vigilante can take on many tasks within a group. Most are skilled at negotiating delicate social situations and courtly intrigue, but they can also serve as stealthy spies or even brutish warriors in dangerous environments.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Vigilante's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Abilities</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Vigilantes are proficient with all simple weapons and light armor and shields (except tower shields). A gunmaster is proficient with all firearms but not with martial weapons or medium armor.</p>
			<p><b>Dual Identity (Ex): </b>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante&#146;s true identity revealed to the world at large.</p>
			<p>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante&#146;s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user&#146;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p>
			<p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante&#146;s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#146;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante&#146;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>
			<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>
			<p><b>Seamless Guise (Ex) </b>: A vigilante knows how to behave in a way that appears perfectly proper and normal for his current identity. Should anyone suspect him of being anything other than what he appears to be while either in his social or vigilante identity, he can attempt a Disguise check with a +20 circumstance bonus to appear as his current identity, and not as his other identity.</p>
			<p><b>Social Talent: </b>Starting at 1st level, and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a social talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet other prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as having another social talent or attaining a minimum vigilante level. Once a talent has been chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Gunmaster: </b>At 1st level, a gunmaster gains the gunslinger&#146;s gunsmith ability (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 9). Additionally, the Gunsmithing bonus feat allows the gunmaster to repair and restore his initial battered firearm as if he were a gunslinger. At 5th level, and every 4 vigilante levels thereafter, the gunmaster gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with all firearms.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces vigilante specialization.</p>
			<p><b>Gunmaster Talents: </b>A gunmaster can select from any of the following vigilante talents, in addition to general vigilante talents.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Talent: </b>Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a vigilante talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as possessing another vigilante talent, possessing a particular specialization, or attaining a minimum level. Once a talent has been selected, it can&#146;t be changed.</p>
			<p>If the vigilante uses any of these talents while in his social identity, he must succeed at a Disguise check against the Perception checks of all onlookers (without the +20 circumstance bonus from seamless guise) or the onlookers will realize that he is more than his social identity appears to be and perhaps discover the social and vigilante identities are one and the same. If a talent calls for a saving throw, the DC for that save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s level + the vigilante&#146;s Charisma modifier, unless stated otherwise.</p>
			<p><b>Nimble (Ex): </b>Starting at 4th level, a gunmaster gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC while wearing light or no armor. Anything that causes the gunmaster to lose her Dexterity bonus to AC also causes the gunmaster to lose this dodge bonus. This bonus increases by 1 for every 6 vigilante levels beyond 4th (to a maximum of +3 at 16th level).</p>
			<p>This ability replaces unshakable.</p>
			<p><b>Startling Appearance (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a vigilante learns to use the element of surprise to his advantage, startling foes that are unaware of his presence. Whenever a vigilante with this ability attempts an attack against a foe that is completely unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (usually due to Stealth or invisibility), the foe is treated as flat-footed for the rest of the vigilante&#146;s turn (uncanny dodge or a similar ability prevents this effect unless the vigilante is at least 4 levels higher than the foe with uncanny dodge). The foe also takes a &#150;4 penalty on attacks made against the vigilante until the start of the vigilante&#146;s next turn.</p>
			<p><b>Frightening Appearance (Ex): </b>At 11th level, whenever a vigilante with this ability makes an attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance above), the vigilante can, as a free action, attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of his attack and any enemies within 10 feet who can see the attack. This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets. If the check succeeds against the target of the vigilante&#146;s attack, that foe is also frightened for 1 round, in addition to being shaken as normal, unless the foe succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier).</p>
			<p>Once a creature has been the target of this ability (either as the target of the attack or as a nearby creature, regardless of whether or not it was successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s frightening appearance for 24 hours. This effect is in addition to the bonuses gained from the startling appearance ability. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Stunning Appearance (Ex) </b>: At 17th level, a vigilante can leave his foes unable to respond when he appears. Whenever a vigilante with this ability makes a successful attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance), the foe must make a successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier) or be stunned until the end of the vigilante&#146;s next turn. If the creature has more HD than the vigilante&#146;s class level, it receives a +4 circumstance bonus on this save. This ability is in addition to the effects of startling appearance and frightening appearance. Once a creature has been the target of this ability (regardless of whether or not the saving throw is successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s stunning appearance for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Vengeance Strike (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>

				<name type="string">Vigilante Specialization</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a vigilante must choose to be either an avenger or a stalker.</p>
					<p>An avenger gains a base attack bonus equal to his vigilante level instead of using those listed on Table 1&#150;1. He adds this value to any other base attack bonus gained from other classes or racial Hit Dice as normal.</p>
					<p>A stalker gains an ability called hidden strike, which allows him to deal an extra 1d8 points of precision damage on melee attacks (or ranged attacks from within 30 feet) against foes who are unaware of his presence, who consider him an ally, or who are made flat-footed by startling appearance (see page 17). This extra damage increases by 1d8 at 3rd level and every 2 vigilante levels thereafter. A stalker vigilante can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that he is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage dice are reduced to d4s. A stalker can deal hidden strike damage against targets with concealment (but not total concealment).</p>
					<p>Once this choice is made, it can&#146;t be changed. While many vigilante talents are usable by both specializations, some are unique to each specialization. A stalker vigilante can apply only one talent marked with an asterisk (*) to a given hidden strike, and only when that hidden strike is dealt against a foe that is unaware of the stalker vigilante&#146;s presence (or who considers him an ally), unless otherwise noted.</p>

This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets. If the check succeeds against the target of the vigilante&#146;s attack, that foe is also frightened for 1 round, in addition to being shaken as normal, unless the foe succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Half-orcs with more distant orc ancestry often look almost indistinguishable from humans, aside from a slightly greenish tint to their skin or sharp teeth. The ability to move through the world without experiencing the same discrimination many of their kin face opens doors that might otherwise be closed, yet many of these half-orcs still take great pride in their heritage and have a powerful desire to show the world that half-orcs are deserving of respect. By taking on an alter-ego that allows them to show their true colors, they can become a champion of the downtrodden and a hero among half-orcs.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Life can be unfair. Think of the starving peasants forced to toil for the local baron or the common laborers tasked with building the king&#146;s newest palace for a mere handful of copper pieces each week. There are those who see these injustices and do nothing. There are those who are willing to reap the rewards obtained through the suffering of others. Then there are those who see inequality and find themselves driven to take action, outside the law if necessary. These vigilantes operate in plain sight, hiding behind respectable personas by day, but donning alternate guises by night to right the wrongs they see all around them.</p>
			<p>Not all vigilantes are out to make the world a better place. Some criminals hide behind the pretense of being ordinary folk, only to become terrors in the shadows, stealing and killing to fulfill some dark agenda. In either case, the vigilante is a character of two natures&#151;the face that everyone knows and the mask that inspires fear.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A vigilante can take on many tasks within a group. Most are skilled at negotiating delicate social situations and courtly intrigue, but they can also serve as stealthy spies or even brutish warriors in dangerous environments.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Vigilante's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Abilities</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Vigilantes are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Dual Identity (Ex): </b>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante&#146;s true identity revealed to the world at large.</p>
			<p>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante&#146;s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user&#146;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p>
			<p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante&#146;s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#146;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante&#146;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>
			<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>
			<p><b>Hidden Heritage (Ex): </b>A ferocious hunter must present as human for his social identity and as a half-orc for his vigilante identity in order to gain the benefits of dual identity. He gains Pass for Human as a bonus feat. In addition, his alignment stays the same when he switches between identities.</p>
			<p>This alters dual identity.</p>
			<p><b>Seamless Guise (Ex) </b>: A vigilante knows how to behave in a way that appears perfectly proper and normal for his current identity. Should anyone suspect him of being anything other than what he appears to be while either in his social or vigilante identity, he can attempt a Disguise check with a +20 circumstance bonus to appear as his current identity, and not as his other identity.</p>
			<p><b>Social Talent: </b>Starting at 1st level, and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a social talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet other prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as having another social talent or attaining a minimum vigilante level. Once a talent has been chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Specialization (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a vigilante must choose to be either an avenger or a stalker.</p>
			<p>An avenger gains a base attack bonus equal to his vigilante level instead of using those listed on Table 1&#150;1. He adds this value to any other base attack bonus gained from other classes or racial Hit Dice as normal.</p>
			<p>A stalker gains an ability called hidden strike, which allows him to deal an extra 1d8 points of precision damage on melee attacks (or ranged attacks from within 30 feet) against foes who are unaware of his presence, who consider him an ally, or who are made flat-footed by startling appearance (see page 17). This extra damage increases by 1d8 at 3rd level and every 2 vigilante levels thereafter. A stalker vigilante can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that he is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage dice are reduced to d4s. A stalker can deal hidden strike damage against targets with concealment (but not total concealment).</p>
			<p>Once this choice is made, it can&#146;t be changed. While many vigilante talents are usable by both specializations, some are unique to each specialization. A stalker vigilante can apply only one talent marked with an asterisk (*) to a given hidden strike, and only when that hidden strike is dealt against a foe that is unaware of the stalker vigilante&#146;s presence (or who considers him an ally), unless otherwise noted.</p>
			<p><b>Symbol of Pride: </b>At 2nd level, a ferocious hunter gains the signature weapon vigilante talent, but must select a falchion, greataxe, or a weapon with &#147;orc&#148; in its name as his chosen weapon. He gains this talent regardless of his chosen vigilante specialization.</p>
			<p>This replaces the vigilante talent gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit of Ferocity (Ex): </b>Starting at 3rd level, when using orc ferocity to continue fighting after falling below 0 hit points, a ferocious hunter fights on for a number of rounds equal to his Constitution modifier.</p>
			<p>This replaces unshakable.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Talent: </b>Starting at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a vigilante talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as possessing another vigilante talent, possessing a particular specialization, or attaining a minimum level. Once a talent has been selected, it can&#146;t be changed.</p>
			<p>If the vigilante uses any of these talents while in his social identity, he must succeed at a Disguise check against the Perception checks of all onlookers (without the +20 circumstance bonus from seamless guise) or the onlookers will realize that he is more than his social identity appears to be and perhaps discover the social and vigilante identities are one and the same. If a talent calls for a saving throw, the DC for that save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s level + the vigilante&#146;s Charisma modifier, unless stated otherwise.</p>
			<p><b>Startling Appearance (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a vigilante learns to use the element of surprise to his advantage, startling foes that are unaware of his presence. Whenever a vigilante with this ability attempts an attack against a foe that is completely unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (usually due to Stealth or invisibility), the foe is treated as flat-footed for the rest of the vigilante&#146;s turn (uncanny dodge or a similar ability prevents this effect unless the vigilante is at least 4 levels higher than the foe with uncanny dodge). The foe also takes a &#150;4 penalty on attacks made against the vigilante until the start of the vigilante&#146;s next turn.</p>
			<p><b>Symbol of Mastery: </b>At 8th level, a ferocious hunter gains Improved Critical with the weapon chosen for the symbol of pride ability. His base attack bonus is equal to his vigilante level for the purpose of qualifying for Critical Focus and any feats that require Critical Focus as a prerequisite.</p>
			<p>This replaces the vigilante talent gained at 8th level.</p>
			<p><b>Frightening Appearance (Ex): </b>At 11th level, whenever a vigilante with this ability makes an attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance above), the vigilante can, as a free action, attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of his attack and any enemies within 10 feet who can see the attack. This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets. If the check succeeds against the target of the vigilante&#146;s attack, that foe is also frightened for 1 round, in addition to being shaken as normal, unless the foe succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier).</p>
			<p>Once a creature has been the target of this ability (either as the target of the attack or as a nearby creature, regardless of whether or not it was successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s frightening appearance for 24 hours. This effect is in addition to the bonuses gained from the startling appearance ability. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Stunning Appearance (Ex) </b>: At 17th level, a vigilante can leave his foes unable to respond when he appears. Whenever a vigilante with this ability makes a successful attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance), the foe must make a successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier) or be stunned until the end of the vigilante&#146;s next turn. If the creature has more HD than the vigilante&#146;s class level, it receives a +4 circumstance bonus on this save. This ability is in addition to the effects of startling appearance and frightening appearance. Once a creature has been the target of this ability (regardless of whether or not the saving throw is successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s stunning appearance for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Vengeance Strike (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>

				<name type="string">Dual Identity</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A faceless enforcer&#146;s vigilante identity is tied to a particular helmet or face covering and suit of armor. Switching between identities means donning or removing this armored outfit. Switching identities means entirely donning or removing armor (even if it is donned hastily) and never takes less than the minimum amount of time to do so. How long this takes depends on the type of armor, as detailed on page 153 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. Once per month, the vigilante can replace the helmet or face covering and armor associated with his vigilante identity and buy or make a new outfit that becomes tied to that identity. A faceless enforcer cannot select the immediate changeUI or quick changeUI social talents.</p>
					<p>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante&#146;s true identity revealed to the world at large.</p>
					<p>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante&#146;s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user&#146;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p>
					<p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante&#146;s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#146;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante&#146;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>
					<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>

				<name type="string">Faceless Infiltrator</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 5th level, when he changes his identity, a faceless enforcer has a third option (instead of social or vigilante) he can assume a fictional identity with no known ties to his Hellknight affiliation, his social identity, or his vigilante identity. When he gains this ability, the faceless enforcer must choose a group, organization, or social structure he wishes to infiltrate (such as the beggars in Egorian&#146;s Cheapside or the city&#146;s congregation of the Midnight Temple to Asmodeus), and the fictional identity he creates must be a recruit, ally, or prospective employee of that group. This fictional identity&#146;s alignment must be within one step from either his vigilante or his social identity. A faceless enforcer can use social and vigilante talents when in his fictional identity, but he risks exposing his secret when he does so.</p>
					<p>When he gains this ability, the faceless enforcer creates mundane records that can verify his fictional identity. While he is in his fictional identity, a faceless enforcer appears to be an otherwise ordinary member of his race, and he receives a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to appear to be the fictional person he says he is. He must create the appearance for this fictional identity using whatever clothing and tools he has at his disposal. If the faceless enforcer changes from his vigilante identity to his fictional identity and vice versa, changing identities takes him the normal amount of time to don or remove his armor (see the armored juggernaut ability). If he changes from his fictional identity to his social identity and vice versa, it takes him 1 minute. Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the fictional identity work as normal if the faceless enforcer is in his fictional identity. Otherwise, it reveals a random member of the group he is attempting to infiltrate.</p>
					<p>At 11th level, the faceless enforcer&#146;s bonus on Disguise checks to appear to be his fictional identity increases to +20. Any spell or ability designed to locate the fictional individual while the faceless enforcer is in that identity has a 50% chance of instead finding a random member of the group. Although this ability does not give the faceless enforcer any special knowledge of the group outside what he gleans himself, the faceless enforcer&#146;s training grants him a +10 circumstance bonus on Bluff checks to maintain his fictional guise.</p>
					<p>At 17th level, attempts to scry or otherwise locate the faceless enforcer&#146;s fictional identity always reveal a random member of the group he has infiltrated. Furthermore, his bonus on Bluff checks to maintain his fictional identity increases to +15.</p>
					<p>Every month, a faceless enforcer can create a new fictional identity, if he wishes, but not another fictional identity that is attempting to infiltrate the same group. A faceless enforcer cannot select the any guiseUI, everymanUI, or many guisesUI social talents.</p>

					<p>At 1st level, a vigilante must choose to be either an avenger or a stalker.</p>
					<p>An avenger gains a base attack bonus equal to his vigilante level instead of using those listed on Table 1&#150;1. He adds this value to any other base attack bonus gained from other classes or racial Hit Dice as normal.</p>
					<p>A stalker gains an ability called hidden strike, which allows him to deal an extra 1d8 points of precision damage on melee attacks (or ranged attacks from within 30 feet) against foes who are unaware of his presence, who consider him an ally, or who are made flat-footed by startling appearance (see page 17). This extra damage increases by 1d8 at 3rd level and every 2 vigilante levels thereafter. A stalker vigilante can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that he is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage dice are reduced to d4s. A stalker can deal hidden strike damage against targets with concealment (but not total concealment).</p>
					<p>Once this choice is made, it can&#146;t be changed. While many vigilante talents are usable by both specializations, some are unique to each specialization. A stalker vigilante can apply only one talent marked with an asterisk (*) to a given hidden strike, and only when that hidden strike is dealt against a foe that is unaware of the stalker vigilante&#146;s presence (or who considers him an ally), unless otherwise noted.</p>

At 6th level, he doesn&#146;t apply the armor check penalty for any armor on Acrobatics, Escape Artist, or Stealth checks, but the penalty applies on other skill checks as normal. At 8th level, a faceless enforcer can move 5 feet faster than normal in heavy armor, to a maximum of his base speed.

Once a creature has been the target of this ability (regardless of whether or not the saving throw is successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s stunning appearance for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>

					<p>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Unyielding warriors, faceless enforcers lock their identities behind implacable helms. While their infamous reputations spread far, striking fear in their foes, the individual behind the mask remains a complete mystery.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Life can be unfair. Think of the starving peasants forced to toil for the local baron or the common laborers tasked with building the king&#146;s newest palace for a mere handful of copper pieces each week. There are those who see these injustices and do nothing. There are those who are willing to reap the rewards obtained through the suffering of others. Then there are those who see inequality and find themselves driven to take action, outside the law if necessary. These vigilantes operate in plain sight, hiding behind respectable personas by day, but donning alternate guises by night to right the wrongs they see all around them.</p>
			<p>Not all vigilantes are out to make the world a better place. Some criminals hide behind the pretense of being ordinary folk, only to become terrors in the shadows, stealing and killing to fulfill some dark agenda. In either case, the vigilante is a character of two natures&#151;the face that everyone knows and the mask that inspires fear.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A vigilante can take on many tasks within a group. Most are skilled at negotiating delicate social situations and courtly intrigue, but they can also serve as stealthy spies or even brutish warriors in dangerous environments.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Vigilante's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Abilities</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Vigilantes are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor. A faceless enforcer is proficient with heavy armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Dual Identity (Ex): </b>A faceless enforcer&#146;s vigilante identity is tied to a particular helmet or face covering and suit of armor. Switching between identities means donning or removing this armored outfit. Switching identities means entirely donning or removing armor (even if it is donned hastily) and never takes less than the minimum amount of time to do so. How long this takes depends on the type of armor, as detailed on page 153 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. Once per month, the vigilante can replace the helmet or face covering and armor associated with his vigilante identity and buy or make a new outfit that becomes tied to that identity. A faceless enforcer cannot select the immediate changeUI or quick changeUI social talents.</p>
			<p>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante&#146;s true identity revealed to the world at large.</p>
			<p>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante&#146;s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user&#146;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p>
			<p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante&#146;s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#146;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante&#146;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>
			<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>
			<p><b>Seamless Guise (Ex) </b>: A vigilante knows how to behave in a way that appears perfectly proper and normal for his current identity. Should anyone suspect him of being anything other than what he appears to be while either in his social or vigilante identity, he can attempt a Disguise check with a +20 circumstance bonus to appear as his current identity, and not as his other identity.</p>
			<p><b>Social Talent: </b>Starting at 1st level, and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a social talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet other prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as having another social talent or attaining a minimum vigilante level. Once a talent has been chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Specialization (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a vigilante must choose to be either an avenger or a stalker.</p>
			<p>An avenger gains a base attack bonus equal to his vigilante level instead of using those listed on Table 1&#150;1. He adds this value to any other base attack bonus gained from other classes or racial Hit Dice as normal.</p>
			<p>A stalker gains an ability called hidden strike, which allows him to deal an extra 1d8 points of precision damage on melee attacks (or ranged attacks from within 30 feet) against foes who are unaware of his presence, who consider him an ally, or who are made flat-footed by startling appearance (see page 17). This extra damage increases by 1d8 at 3rd level and every 2 vigilante levels thereafter. A stalker vigilante can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that he is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage dice are reduced to d4s. A stalker can deal hidden strike damage against targets with concealment (but not total concealment).</p>
			<p>Once this choice is made, it can&#146;t be changed. While many vigilante talents are usable by both specializations, some are unique to each specialization. A stalker vigilante can apply only one talent marked with an asterisk (*) to a given hidden strike, and only when that hidden strike is dealt against a foe that is unaware of the stalker vigilante&#146;s presence (or who considers him an ally), unless otherwise noted.</p>
			<p><b>Armored Juggernaut (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a faceless enforcer does not need help donning half-plate or full-plate armor, but donning it alone takes him 8 minutes. At 4th level, he can don his half-plate or full-plate alone in 4 minutes, and can don it hastily in 2 minutes. At 6th level, he doesn&#146;t apply the armor check penalty for any armor on Acrobatics, Escape Artist, or Stealth checks, but the penalty applies on other skill checks as normal. At 8th level, a faceless enforcer can move 5 feet faster than normal in heavy armor, to a maximum of his base speed. At 10th level, it takes him 2 minutes to don heavy armor, 1 minute to don it hastily, and 1 minute to remove it. At 16th level, he can move at full speed in heavy armor. At 18th level, it never takes the vigilante more than 1 minute to don his armor.</p>
			<p>This replaces the vigilante talent gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Unshakable (Ex): </b>Starting at 3rd level, a vigilante adds his class level to the DC of any attempts to Intimidate him.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Talent: </b>Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a vigilante talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as possessing another vigilante talent, possessing a particular specialization, or attaining a minimum level. Once a talent has been selected, it can&#146;t be changed.If the vigilante uses any of these talents while in his social identity, he must succeed at a Disguise check against the Perception checks of all onlookers (without the +20 circumstance bonus from seamless guise) or the onlookers will realize that he is more than his social identity appears to be and perhaps discover the social and vigilante identities are one and the same. If a talent calls for a saving throw, the DC for that save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s level + the vigilante&#146;s Charisma modifier, unless stated otherwise.</p>
			<p><b>Faceless Infiltrator (Ex): </b>At 5th level, when he changes his identity, a faceless enforcer has a third option (instead of social or vigilante) he can assume a fictional identity with no known ties to his Hellknight affiliation, his social identity, or his vigilante identity. When he gains this ability, the faceless enforcer must choose a group, organization, or social structure he wishes to infiltrate (such as the beggars in Egorian&#146;s Cheapside or the city&#146;s congregation of the Midnight Temple to Asmodeus), and the fictional identity he creates must be a recruit, ally, or prospective employee of that group. This fictional identity&#146;s alignment must be within one step from either his vigilante or his social identity. A faceless enforcer can use social and vigilante talents when in his fictional identity, but he risks exposing his secret when he does so.</p>
			<p>When he gains this ability, the faceless enforcer creates mundane records that can verify his fictional identity. While he is in his fictional identity, a faceless enforcer appears to be an otherwise ordinary member of his race, and he receives a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to appear to be the fictional person he says he is. He must create the appearance for this fictional identity using whatever clothing and tools he has at his disposal. If the faceless enforcer changes from his vigilante identity to his fictional identity and vice versa, changing identities takes him the normal amount of time to don or remove his armor (see the armored juggernaut ability). If he changes from his fictional identity to his social identity and vice versa, it takes him 1 minute. Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the fictional identity work as normal if the faceless enforcer is in his fictional identity. Otherwise, it reveals a random member of the group he is attempting to infiltrate.</p>
			<p>At 11th level, the faceless enforcer&#146;s bonus on Disguise checks to appear to be his fictional identity increases to +20. Any spell or ability designed to locate the fictional individual while the faceless enforcer is in that identity has a 50% chance of instead finding a random member of the group. Although this ability does not give the faceless enforcer any special knowledge of the group outside what he gleans himself, the faceless enforcer&#146;s training grants him a +10 circumstance bonus on Bluff checks to maintain his fictional guise.</p>
			<p>At 17th level, attempts to scry or otherwise locate the faceless enforcer&#146;s fictional identity always reveal a random member of the group he has infiltrated. Furthermore, his bonus on Bluff checks to maintain his fictional identity increases to +15.</p>
			<p>Every month, a faceless enforcer can create a new fictional identity, if he wishes, but not another fictional identity that is attempting to infiltrate the same group. A faceless enforcer cannot select the any guiseUI, everymanUI, or many guisesUI social talents.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the social talents gained at 5th, 11th, and 17th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Startling Appearance (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a vigilante learns to use the element of surprise to his advantage, startling foes that are unaware of his presence. Whenever a vigilante with this ability attempts an attack against a foe that is completely unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (usually due to Stealth or invisibility), the foe is treated as flat-footed for the rest of the vigilante&#146;s turn (uncanny dodge or a similar ability prevents this effect unless the vigilante is at least 4 levels higher than the foe with uncanny dodge). The foe also takes a &#150;4 penalty on attacks made against the vigilante until the start of the vigilante&#146;s next turn.</p>
			<p><b>Enforcer&#146;s Wrath (Ex): </b>At 6th level, a faceless enforcer has become adept at using his vigilante identity to terrify and coerce lone enemies, particularly among the group he is currently infiltrating. He gains a +4 bonus on Intimidate checks against enemies when no other opponents are within 30 feet of him (or the creature he is intimidating). This bonus stacks with any bonuses the vigilante receives from renown or similar abilities. Additionally, if the vigilante successfully demoralizes a lone opponent with Intimidate, the opponent is shaken for 1 additional round.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the vigilante talent gained at 6th level.</p>
			<p><b>Frightening Appearance (Ex): </b>At 11th level, whenever a vigilante with this ability makes an attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance above), the vigilante can, as a free action, attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of his attack and any enemies within 10 feet who can see the attack. This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets. If the check succeeds against the target of the vigilante&#146;s attack, that foe is also frightened for 1 round, in addition to being shaken as normal, unless the foe succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier).</p>
			<p>Once a creature has been the target of this ability (either as the target of the attack or as a nearby creature, regardless of whether or not it was successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s frightening appearance for 24 hours. This effect is in addition to the bonuses gained from the startling appearance ability. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Stunning Appearance (Ex) </b>: At 17th level, a vigilante can leave his foes unable to respond when he appears. Whenever a vigilante with this ability makes a successful attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance), the foe must make a successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier) or be stunned until the end of the vigilante&#146;s next turn. If the creature has more HD than the vigilante&#146;s class level, it receives a +4 circumstance bonus on this save. This ability is in addition to the effects of startling appearance and frightening appearance. Once a creature has been the target of this ability (regardless of whether or not the saving throw is successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s stunning appearance for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Vengeance Strike (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>

This doesn&#146;t consume his mutagen, and lasts a number of rounds equal to 3 + his vigilante level, after which the transformation ends and he becomes fatigued. While transformed in this way, he is confused, and he rerolls any result of &#147;act normally.&#148; Since the confusion is part of the mutagenic transformation, abilities that prevent or remove confusion don&#146;t apply to this effect, though abilities that end the effect of a mutagen work normally.

For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some vigilantes adopt lives of secrecy to hide their strange experiments from public view.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Life can be unfair. Think of the starving peasants forced to toil for the local baron or the common laborers tasked with building the king&#146;s newest palace for a mere handful of copper pieces each week. There are those who see these injustices and do nothing. There are those who are willing to reap the rewards obtained through the suffering of others. Then there are those who see inequality and find themselves driven to take action, outside the law if necessary. These vigilantes operate in plain sight, hiding behind respectable personas by day, but donning alternate guises by night to right the wrongs they see all around them.</p>
			<p>Not all vigilantes are out to make the world a better place. Some criminals hide behind the pretense of being ordinary folk, only to become terrors in the shadows, stealing and killing to fulfill some dark agenda. In either case, the vigilante is a character of two natures&#151;the face that everyone knows and the mask that inspires fear.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A vigilante can take on many tasks within a group. Most are skilled at negotiating delicate social situations and courtly intrigue, but they can also serve as stealthy spies or even brutish warriors in dangerous environments.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Vigilante's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Abilities</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Vigilantes are proficient with all simple weapons and light armor. Experimenters aren&#146;t proficient with martial weapons, medium armor, or shields.</p>
			<p><b>Dual Identity (Ex): </b>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante&#146;s true identity revealed to the world at large.</p>
			<p>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante&#146;s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user&#146;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p>
			<p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante&#146;s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#146;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante&#146;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>
			<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>
			<p><b>Mutagenic Change (Ex): </b>As a full-round action, an experimenter can consume his mutagen (if he has one) and shift from his social identity to his vigilante identity, as if he had the quick change social talent.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the 1st-level social talent.</p>
			<p><b>Seamless Guise (Ex) </b>: A vigilante knows how to behave in a way that appears perfectly proper and normal for his current identity. Should anyone suspect him of being anything other than what he appears to be while either in his social or vigilante identity, he can attempt a Disguise check with a +20 circumstance bonus to appear as his current identity, and not as his other identity.</p>
			<p><b>Forbidden Science (Ex): </b>An experimenter gains a bonus equal to 1/2 his vigilante level on Craft (alchemy) checks to create alchemical items and on Knowledge (engineering) checks (minimum +1). He also learns how to craft a mutagenAPG as if he were an alchemist of his class level. He can take alchemical discoveries in place of vigilante talents, but only discoveries that affect his mutagen (including cognatogenUM discoveries). When an experimenter is confused, dazed, frightened, panicked, or stunned, he must attempt a Will save (DC = 20 + his vigilante level) each round at the start of his turn. If he fails, he transforms as if he had consumed his mutagen (determine which ability score gets the bonus randomly). This doesn&#146;t consume his mutagen, and lasts a number of rounds equal to 3 + his vigilante level, after which the transformation ends and he becomes fatigued. While transformed in this way, he is confused, and he rerolls any result of &#147;act normally.&#148; Since the confusion is part of the mutagenic transformation, abilities that prevent or remove confusion don&#146;t apply to this effect, though abilities that end the effect of a mutagen work normally. He forgets everything that happened while he was involuntarily transformed.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces vigilante specialization.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Talent: </b>Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a vigilante talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as possessing another vigilante talent, possessing a particular specialization, or attaining a minimum level. Once a talent has been selected, it can&#146;t be changed.</p>
			<p>If the vigilante uses any of these talents while in his social identity, he must succeed at a Disguise check against the Perception checks of all onlookers (without the +20 circumstance bonus from seamless guise) or the onlookers will realize that he is more than his social identity appears to be and perhaps discover the social and vigilante identities are one and the same. If a talent calls for a saving throw, the DC for that save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s level + the vigilante&#146;s Charisma modifier, unless stated otherwise.</p>
			<p><b>Brew Potion: </b>At 3rd level, an experimenter gains Brew Potion as a bonus feat. He treats his vigilante level as his caster level and can use Craft (alchemy) instead of Spellcraft to brew potions. He can use another potion of the same spell as a sample to provide the necessary spell without consuming the potion, increasing the DC by 5.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces unshakable.</p>
			<p><b>Social Talent: </b>Starting at 1st level, and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a social talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet other prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as having another social talent or attaining a minimum vigilante level. Once a talent has been chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Lore Master (Ex): </b>At 5th level, an experimenter gains the lore master bard class feature.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces startling appearance.</p>
			<p><b>Craft Construct: </b>At 11th level, an experimenter gains Craft Construct as a bonus feat. He treats his vigilante level as his caster level and can use Knowledge (engineering) instead of Spellcraft to craft a construct.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces frightening appearance.</p>
			<p><b>Mutable Mutagen: </b>At 17th level, the duration of an experimenter&#146;s mutagen increases to 1 hour per level.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces stunning appearance.</p>
			<p><b>Vengeance Strike (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>

				<name type="string">Dual Identity</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante&#146;s true identity revealed to the world at large.</p>
					<p>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante&#146;s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user&#146;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p>
					<p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante&#146;s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#146;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante&#146;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>
					<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>

					<p>At 1st level, a vigilante must choose to be either an avenger or a stalker.</p>
					<p>An avenger gains a base attack bonus equal to his vigilante level instead of using those listed on Table 1&#150;1. He adds this value to any other base attack bonus gained from other classes or racial Hit Dice as normal.</p>
					<p>A stalker gains an ability called hidden strike, which allows him to deal an extra 1d8 points of precision damage on melee attacks (or ranged attacks from within 30 feet) against foes who are unaware of his presence, who consider him an ally, or who are made flat-footed by startling appearance (see page 17). This extra damage increases by 1d8 at 3rd level and every 2 vigilante levels thereafter. A stalker vigilante can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that he is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage dice are reduced to d4s. A stalker can deal hidden strike damage against targets with concealment (but not total concealment).</p>
					<p>Once this choice is made, it can&#146;t be changed. While many vigilante talents are usable by both specializations, some are unique to each specialization. A stalker vigilante can apply only one talent marked with an asterisk (*) to a given hidden strike, and only when that hidden strike is dealt against a foe that is unaware of the stalker vigilante&#146;s presence (or who considers him an ally), unless otherwise noted.</p>

The rule of King-Regent Noleski Surtova grows increasingly tenuous; to hold his position, he sends handpicked agents into the kingdom&#146;s courts to flush out traitors to the Dragonscale Throne. When not acting as courtiers, these agents don fearsome draconic masks, becoming anonymous protectors of the kingregent&#146;s rule.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Life can be unfair. Think of the starving peasants forced to toil for the local baron or the common laborers tasked with building the king&#146;s newest palace for a mere handful of copper pieces each week. There are those who see these injustices and do nothing. There are those who are willing to reap the rewards obtained through the suffering of others. Then there are those who see inequality and find themselves driven to take action, outside the law if necessary. These vigilantes operate in plain sight, hiding behind respectable personas by day, but donning alternate guises by night to right the wrongs they see all around them.</p>
			<p>Not all vigilantes are out to make the world a better place. Some criminals hide behind the pretense of being ordinary folk, only to become terrors in the shadows, stealing and killing to fulfill some dark agenda. In either case, the vigilante is a character of two natures&#151;the face that everyone knows and the mask that inspires fear.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A vigilante can take on many tasks within a group. Most are skilled at negotiating delicate social situations and courtly intrigue, but they can also serve as stealthy spies or even brutish warriors in dangerous environments.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Vigilante's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Abilities</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Vigilantes are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Dual Identity (Ex): </b>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante&#146;s true identity revealed to the world at large.</p>
			<p>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante&#146;s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user&#146;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p>
			<p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante&#146;s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#146;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante&#146;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>
			<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>
			<p><b>Ruby Courtier (Ex): </b>Surtova&#146;s minions pose as minor nobles studying the Aldori swordlord traditions common throughout Brevoy. At 1st level, a Dragonscale loyalist gains Exotic Weapon Proficiency (Aldori dueling swordISWG) as a bonus feat. His social identity must appear to be that of a noble, and he can&#146;t select double time, many guises, or any social talent inappropriate for a noble social identity.</p>
			<p>This ability alters social talents and replaces the 1st-level social talent.</p>
			<p><b>Seamless Guise (Ex) </b>: A vigilante knows how to behave in a way that appears perfectly proper and normal for his current identity. Should anyone suspect him of being anything other than what he appears to be while either in his social or vigilante identity, he can attempt a Disguise check with a +20 circumstance bonus to appear as his current identity, and not as his other identity.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Specialization (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a vigilante must choose to be either an avenger or a stalker.</p>
			<p>An avenger gains a base attack bonus equal to his vigilante level instead of using those listed on Table 1&#150;1. He adds this value to any other base attack bonus gained from other classes or racial Hit Dice as normal.</p>
			<p>A stalker gains an ability called hidden strike, which allows him to deal an extra 1d8 points of precision damage on melee attacks (or ranged attacks from within 30 feet) against foes who are unaware of his presence, who consider him an ally, or who are made flat-footed by startling appearance (see page 17). This extra damage increases by 1d8 at 3rd level and every 2 vigilante levels thereafter. A stalker vigilante can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that he is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage dice are reduced to d4s. A stalker can deal hidden strike damage against targets with concealment (but not total concealment).</p>
			<p>Once this choice is made, it can&#146;t be changed. While many vigilante talents are usable by both specializations, some are unique to each specialization. A stalker vigilante can apply only one talent marked with an asterisk (*) to a given hidden strike, and only when that hidden strike is dealt against a foe that is unaware of the stalker vigilante&#146;s presence (or who considers him an ally), unless otherwise noted.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Talent: </b>Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a vigilante talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as possessing another vigilante talent, possessing a particular specialization, or attaining a minimum level. Once a talent has been selected, it can&#146;t be changed.</p>
			<p>If the vigilante uses any of these talents while in his social identity, he must succeed at a Disguise check against the Perception checks of all onlookers (without the +20 circumstance bonus from seamless guise) or the onlookers will realize that he is more than his social identity appears to be and perhaps discover the social and vigilante identities are one and the same. If a talent calls for a saving throw, the DC for that save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s level + the vigilante&#146;s Charisma modifier, unless stated otherwise.</p>
			<p><b>Reflexive Reaction (Ex): </b>A Dragonscale loyalist lacks the conviction of other vigilantes, but his reactions are keenly honed. At 3rd level, if a Dragonscale loyalist acts during a surprise round, he can take a full round&#146;s worth of actions. If he does, he is staggered during the first full round of combat.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces unshakable.</p>
			<p><b>Social Talent: </b>Starting at 1st level, and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a social talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet other prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as having another social talent or attaining a minimum vigilante level. Once a talent has been chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>False Allegiance (Ex): </b>Eventually, a loyalist begins training to infiltrate one of Brevoy&#146;s great houses. At 5th level, a Dragonscale loyalist chooses one of the seven houses of Brevoy, gaining a bonus feat and a special ability appropriate to the chosen house. He need not meet the feat&#146;s prerequisites.</p>
			<p><i>House Garess: </i>The Dragonscale loyalist gains Sure GraspUC and dwarves&#146; stonecunning racial trait.</p>
			<p><i>House Lebeda: </i>The Dragonscale loyalist gains Skill Focus (Appraise). He can also resell items for 60% of their listed value, rather than 50%. The purchase limit of the settlement must be high enough to accommodate the increased value.</p>
			<p><i>House Lodovka: </i>The Dragonscale loyalist gains Sea LegsUC. When attempting Swim checks, he ignores the armor check penalty of light or medium armor. If the loyalist has the heavy training vigilante talent, this applies to heavy armor as well.</p>
			<p><i>House Medvyed: </i>The Dragonscale loyalist gains Endurance and the druid&#146;s resist nature&#146;s lure class feature.</p>
			<p><i>House Orlovsky: </i>The Dragonscale loyalist gains Call TruceUI and a +3 bonus to his CMD.</p>
			<p><i>House Rogarvia: </i>The Dragonscale loyalist gains Skill Focus (Knowledge [history]) and a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks to gather information. This bonus increases to +4 when gathering information related to the Rogarvias.</p>
			<p><i>House Surtova: </i>The Dragonscale loyalist gains Persuasive and a +4 bonus on Sense Motive checks against creatures that profess to be his allies.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces startling appearance.</p>
			<p><b>Dragonscale Vigilance (Su): </b>A Dragonscale loyalist becomes supernaturally perceptive to plots against his lord. At 11th level, while in his vigilante identity, a Dragonscale loyalist is treated as constantly being under the effects of perceive betrayal . This effect&#146;s caster level is equal to the Dragonscale loyalist&#146;s vigilante level, and he doesn&#146;t require material components or a focus.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the vigilante&#146;s frightening appearance.</p>
			<p><b>Conqueror&#146;s Wrath (Ex): </b>Inspired by the deeds of Chora the Conqueror, a loyalist can rampage through enemy ranks. At 17th level, as a full-round action, a Dragonscale loyalist can make a full attack and move up to his speed. The loyalist can pause at any point or points during the movement, make one or more of his attacks, and continue moving. Creatures making attacks of opportunity against the loyalist during this movement gain a +4 bonus on their attack and damage rolls. Using this ability counts as using a vigilante talent.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces stunning appearance.</p>
			<p><b>Vengeance Strike (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>

					<p>At 1st level, a darklantern can transform into her vigilante identity as a full-round action. When a darklantern switches to her vigilante identity, she undergoes a horrifying transformation from an elf into a drow. After the transformation is complete, the darklantern takes on the appearance of a drow (but otherwise retains her normal facial features and voice) and gains a +2 bonus to Dexterity and Charisma, darkvision with a range of up to 60 feet, and the light blindness universal monster ability. While in her vigilante identity, the darklantern counts as a drow for the purpose of any ability, spell, or magic item targeting drow. A darklantern&#146;s vigilante identity must be chaotic evil, but her social identity can be more than one step removed from this alignment.</p>
					<p>Transforming back into the darklantern&#146;s social identity requires a move action. However, a darklantern must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + the number of hours she has been in her vigilante identity) in order to successfully transform back into her social identity; otherwise, the move action is wasted and the action cannot be attempted for 1 minute. Each time a darklantern fails this check, she takes 1 point of Wisdom damage and the DC for the save decreases by 2.</p>

For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The Lantern Bearers are an elite group of elves dedicated to the containment and eradication of the drow. However, some Lantern Bearers are tasked with the unthinkable assignment of infiltrating drow society so as to relay information to the Winter Council&#151;a secret cabal tasked with keeping the existence of drow a secret&#151;about activities in the Darklands and drow cities. In order to accomplish this task, select members of the Lantern Bearers undergo a horrific ritual allowing them to temporarily experience the dark transformation into a drow, but at the cost of their sanity.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Life can be unfair. Think of the starving peasants forced to toil for the local baron or the common laborers tasked with building the king&#146;s newest palace for a mere handful of copper pieces each week. There are those who see these injustices and do nothing. There are those who are willing to reap the rewards obtained through the suffering of others. Then there are those who see inequality and find themselves driven to take action, outside the law if necessary. These vigilantes operate in plain sight, hiding behind respectable personas by day, but donning alternate guises by night to right the wrongs they see all around them.</p>
			<p>Not all vigilantes are out to make the world a better place. Some criminals hide behind the pretense of being ordinary folk, only to become terrors in the shadows, stealing and killing to fulfill some dark agenda. In either case, the vigilante is a character of two natures&#151;the face that everyone knows and the mask that inspires fear.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A vigilante can take on many tasks within a group. Most are skilled at negotiating delicate social situations and courtly intrigue, but they can also serve as stealthy spies or even brutish warriors in dangerous environments.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Elven Ancestry: </b>A darklantern must be a creature with the elf subtype.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Vigilante's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Abilities</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Vigilantes are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Dual Identity (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a darklantern can transform into her vigilante identity as a full-round action. When a darklantern switches to her vigilante identity, she undergoes a horrifying transformation from an elf into a drow. After the transformation is complete, the darklantern takes on the appearance of a drow (but otherwise retains her normal facial features and voice) and gains a +2 bonus to Dexterity and Charisma, darkvision with a range of up to 60 feet, and the light blindness universal monster ability. While in her vigilante identity, the darklantern counts as a drow for the purpose of any ability, spell, or magic item targeting drow. A darklantern&#146;s vigilante identity must be chaotic evil, but her social identity can be more than one step removed from this alignment.</p>
			<p>Transforming back into the darklantern&#146;s social identity requires a move action. However, a darklantern must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + the number of hours she has been in her vigilante identity) in order to successfully transform back into her social identity; otherwise, the move action is wasted and the action cannot be attempted for 1 minute. Each time a darklantern fails this check, she takes 1 point of Wisdom damage and the DC for the save decreases by 2.</p>
			<p>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante&#146;s true identity revealed to the world at large.</p>
			<p>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante&#146;s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user&#146;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p>
			<p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante&#146;s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#146;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante&#146;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>
			<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>
			<p><b>Drow Magic (Sp): </b>At 1st level, when in her vigilante identity, a darklantern can cast dancing lights, darkness, and faerie fire, once each per day, using her vigilante level as her caster level.</p>
			<p>This replaces the social talent that the darklantern gains at 1st level.</p>
			<p><b>Seamless Guise (Ex) </b>: A vigilante knows how to behave in a way that appears perfectly proper and normal for his current identity. Should anyone suspect him of being anything other than what he appears to be while either in his social or vigilante identity, he can attempt a Disguise check with a +20 circumstance bonus to appear as his current identity, and not as his other identity.</p>
			<p><b>Social Talent: </b>Starting at 1st level, and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a social talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet other prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as having another social talent or attaining a minimum vigilante level. Once a talent has been chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Specialization (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a vigilante must choose to be either an avenger or a stalker.</p>
			<p>An avenger gains a base attack bonus equal to his vigilante level instead of using those listed on Table 1&#150;1. He adds this value to any other base attack bonus gained from other classes or racial Hit Dice as normal.</p>
			<p>A stalker gains an ability called hidden strike, which allows him to deal an extra 1d8 points of precision damage on melee attacks (or ranged attacks from within 30 feet) against foes who are unaware of his presence, who consider him an ally, or who are made flat-footed by startling appearance (see page 17). This extra damage increases by 1d8 at 3rd level and every 2 vigilante levels thereafter. A stalker vigilante can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that he is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage dice are reduced to d4s. A stalker can deal hidden strike damage against targets with concealment (but not total concealment).</p>
			<p>Once this choice is made, it can&#146;t be changed. While many vigilante talents are usable by both specializations, some are unique to each specialization. A stalker vigilante can apply only one talent marked with an asterisk (*) to a given hidden strike, and only when that hidden strike is dealt against a foe that is unaware of the stalker vigilante&#146;s presence (or who considers him an ally), unless otherwise noted.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Talent: </b>Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a vigilante talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as possessing another vigilante talent, possessing a particular specialization, or attaining a minimum level. Once a talent has been selected, it can&#146;t be changed.</p>
			<p>If the vigilante uses any of these talents while in his social identity, he must succeed at a Disguise check against the Perception checks of all onlookers (without the +20 circumstance bonus from seamless guise) or the onlookers will realize that he is more than his social identity appears to be and perhaps discover the social and vigilante identities are one and the same. If a talent calls for a saving throw, the DC for that save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s level + the vigilante&#146;s Charisma modifier, unless stated otherwise.</p>
			<p><b>Unshakable (Ex): </b>Starting at 3rd level, a vigilante adds his class level to the DC of any attempts to Intimidate him.</p>
			<p><b>Drow Paragon (Su): </b>At 4th level, the darklantern gains Spell Resistance equal to 6 + her vigilante level, and the range of her darkvision increases to 120 feet while in her vigilante identity.</p>
			<p>This replaces the vigilante talent gained at 4th level.</p>
			<p><b>Startling Appearance (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a vigilante learns to use the element of surprise to his advantage, startling foes that are unaware of his presence. Whenever a vigilante with this ability attempts an attack against a foe that is completely unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (usually due to Stealth or invisibility), the foe is treated as flat-footed for the rest of the vigilante&#146;s turn (uncanny dodge or a similar ability prevents this effect unless the vigilante is at least 4 levels higher than the foe with uncanny dodge). The foe also takes a &#150;4 penalty on attacks made against the vigilante until the start of the vigilante&#146;s next turn.</p>
			<p><b>Frightening Appearance (Ex): </b>At 11th level, whenever a vigilante with this ability makes an attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance above), the vigilante can, as a free action, attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of his attack and any enemies within 10 feet who can see the attack. This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets.

			<p><b>Stunning Appearance (Ex) </b>: At 17th level, a vigilante can leave his foes unable to respond when he appears. Whenever a vigilante with this ability makes a successful attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance), the foe must make a successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier) or be stunned until the end of the vigilante&#146;s next turn. If the creature has more HD than the vigilante&#146;s class level, it receives a +4 circumstance bonus on this save. This ability is in addition to the effects of startling appearance and frightening appearance. Once a creature has been the target of this ability (regardless of whether or not the saving throw is successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s stunning appearance for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Vengeance Strike (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>

				<name type="string">Dual Identity</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante&#146;s true identity revealed to the world at large.</p>
					<p>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante&#146;s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user&#146;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p>
					<p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante&#146;s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#146;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante&#146;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>
					<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>

					<p>At 1st level, a vigilante must choose to be either an avenger or a stalker.</p>
					<p>An avenger gains a base attack bonus equal to his vigilante level instead of using those listed on Table 1&#150;1. He adds this value to any other base attack bonus gained from other classes or racial Hit Dice as normal.</p>
					<p>A stalker gains an ability called hidden strike, which allows him to deal an extra 1d8 points of precision damage on melee attacks (or ranged attacks from within 30 feet) against foes who are unaware of his presence, who consider him an ally, or who are made flat-footed by startling appearance (see page 17). This extra damage increases by 1d8 at 3rd level and every 2 vigilante levels thereafter. A stalker vigilante can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that he is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage dice are reduced to d4s. A stalker can deal hidden strike damage against targets with concealment (but not total concealment).</p>
					<p>Once this choice is made, it can&#146;t be changed. While many vigilante talents are usable by both specializations, some are unique to each specialization. A stalker vigilante can apply only one talent marked with an asterisk (*) to a given hidden strike, and only when that hidden strike is dealt against a foe that is unaware of the stalker vigilante&#146;s presence (or who considers him an ally), unless otherwise noted.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>-</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Life can be unfair. Think of the starving peasants forced to toil for the local baron or the common laborers tasked with building the king&#146;s newest palace for a mere handful of copper pieces each week. There are those who see these injustices and do nothing. There are those who are willing to reap the rewards obtained through the suffering of others. Then there are those who see inequality and find themselves driven to take action, outside the law if necessary. These vigilantes operate in plain sight, hiding behind respectable personas by day, but donning alternate guises by night to right the wrongs they see all around them.</p>
			<p>Not all vigilantes are out to make the world a better place. Some criminals hide behind the pretense of being ordinary folk, only to become terrors in the shadows, stealing and killing to fulfill some dark agenda. In either case, the vigilante is a character of two natures&#151;the face that everyone knows and the mask that inspires fear.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A vigilante can take on many tasks within a group. Most are skilled at negotiating delicate social situations and courtly intrigue, but they can also serve as stealthy spies or even brutish warriors in dangerous environments.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Vigilante's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Abilities</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Vigilantes are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Dual Identity (Ex): </b>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante&#146;s true identity revealed to the world at large.</p>
			<p>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante&#146;s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user&#146;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p>
			<p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante&#146;s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#146;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante&#146;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>
			<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>
			<p><b>Oni Mask (Ex): </b>A Chu Ye enforcer gains a grotesque horned mask that he must wear when assuming his vigilante identity. The mask has 10 hit points per vigilante level he has and hardness 5. While wearing the mask, the Chu Ye enforcer gains a bonus to Intimidate equal to 1/2 his level (minimum +1). Without this mask, a Chu Ye enforcer can&#146;t assume his vigilante identity. A Chu Ye enforcer who loses his mask can replace it after 1 day through a specialized ritual that takes 8 hours to complete and costs 200 gp per vigilante level he has.</p>
			<p>This alters dual identity.</p>
			<p><b>Seamless Guise (Ex) </b>: A vigilante knows how to behave in a way that appears perfectly proper and normal for his current identity. Should anyone suspect him of being anything other than what he appears to be while either in his social or vigilante identity, he can attempt a Disguise check with a +20 circumstance bonus to appear as his current identity, and not as his other identity.</p>
			<p><b>Steel Dictate (Ex): </b>A Chu Ye enforcer gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat, and when he hits with his unarmed strike, he gains a bonus on damage rolls equal to half his vigilante level (minimum +1, maximum of +5).</p>
			<p>This replaces the social talent gained at 1st level.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Specialization (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a vigilante must choose to be either an avenger or a stalker.</p>
			<p>An avenger gains a base attack bonus equal to his vigilante level instead of using those listed on Table 1&#150;1. He adds this value to any other base attack bonus gained from other classes or racial Hit Dice as normal.</p>
			<p>A stalker gains an ability called hidden strike, which allows him to deal an extra 1d8 points of precision damage on melee attacks (or ranged attacks from within 30 feet) against foes who are unaware of his presence, who consider him an ally, or who are made flat-footed by startling appearance (see page 17). This extra damage increases by 1d8 at 3rd level and every 2 vigilante levels thereafter. A stalker vigilante can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that he is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage dice are reduced to d4s. A stalker can deal hidden strike damage against targets with concealment (but not total concealment).</p>
			<p>Once this choice is made, it can&#146;t be changed. While many vigilante talents are usable by both specializations, some are unique to each specialization. A stalker vigilante can apply only one talent marked with an asterisk (*) to a given hidden strike, and only when that hidden strike is dealt against a foe that is unaware of the stalker vigilante&#146;s presence (or who considers him an ally), unless otherwise noted.</p>
			<p><b>Yokai Heart (Su): </b>A Chu Ye enforcer seeks to transmute himself into a destructive spirit and terrorize his enemies. His vigilante identity alignment must be non-good. While in his vigilante identity, the Chu Ye enforcer gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet and low-light vision, and he counts as both a native outsider with the oni subtype and his original type for any effect related to type, whichever is worse for him.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Talent: </b>Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a vigilante talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as possessing another vigilante talent, possessing a particular specialization, or attaining a minimum level. Once a talent has been selected, it can&#146;t be changed.</p>
			<p>If the vigilante uses any of these talents while in his social identity, he must succeed at a Disguise check against the Perception checks of all onlookers (without the +20 circumstance bonus from seamless guise) or the onlookers will realize that he is more than his social identity appears to be and perhaps discover the social and vigilante identities are one and the same. If a talent calls for a saving throw, the DC for that save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s level + the vigilante&#146;s Charisma modifier, unless stated otherwise.</p>
			<p><b>Social Talent: </b>Starting at 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a social talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet other prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as having another social talent or attaining a minimum vigilante level. Once a talent has been chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Unshakable (Ex): </b>Starting at 3rd level, a vigilante adds his class level to the DC of any attempts to Intimidate him.</p>
			<p><b>Deceitful Form (Sp): </b>At 4th level, a Chu Ye enforcer gains the shapechanger subtype and the ability to change his form, as per alter self, for a number of minutes per day equal to his vigilante level. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments. At 14th level, he can instead use this ability as per giant form I. At 18th level, he can use this ability as per giant form II.</p>
			<p>This replaces the vigilante talents gained at 4th, 14th, and 18th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Startling Appearance (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a vigilante learns to use the element of surprise to his advantage, startling foes that are unaware of his presence. Whenever a vigilante with this ability attempts an attack against a foe that is completely unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (usually due to Stealth or invisibility), the foe is treated as flat-footed for the rest of the vigilante&#146;s turn (uncanny dodge or a similar ability prevents this effect unless the vigilante is at least 4 levels higher than the foe with uncanny dodge). The foe also takes a &#150;4 penalty on attacks made against the vigilante until the start of the vigilante&#146;s next turn.</p>
			<p><b>Deadly Horns (Ex): </b>At 6th level, while in his vigilante identity, a Chu Ye enforcer gains a gore attack. This is a primary natural attack that deals 1d6 points of piercing damage.</p>
			<p>This replaces the vigilante talent gained at 6th level.</p>
			<p><b>Frightening Appearance (Ex): </b>At 11th level, whenever a vigilante with this ability makes an attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance above), the vigilante can, as a free action, attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of his attack and any enemies within 10 feet who can see the attack. This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets. If the check succeeds against the target of the vigilante&#146;s attack, that foe is also frightened for 1 round, in addition to being shaken as normal, unless the foe succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier).</p>
			<p>Once a creature has been the target of this ability (either as the target of the attack or as a nearby creature, regardless of whether or not it was successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s frightening appearance for 24 hours. This effect is in addition to the bonuses gained from the startling appearance ability. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Third Eye (Su): </b>At 12th level, a Chu Ye enforcer&#146;s mask manifests a third eye. As a swift action a number of times per day equal to his vigilante level, he can launch a beam of fire from the eye as a ranged touch attack with a range of 180 feet. On a hit, the beam deals 4d6 points of fire damage. At 18th level, the beam damage increases to 8d6 points of fire damage.</p>
			<p>This replaces the vigilante talent gained at 12th level.</p>
			<p><b>Stunning Appearance (Ex) </b>: At 17th level, a vigilante can leave his foes unable to respond when he appears. Whenever a vigilante with this ability makes a successful attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance), the foe must make a successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier) or be stunned until the end of the vigilante&#146;s next turn. If the creature has more HD than the vigilante&#146;s class level, it receives a +4 circumstance bonus on this save. This ability is in addition to the effects of startling appearance and frightening appearance. Once a creature has been the target of this ability (regardless of whether or not the saving throw is successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s stunning appearance for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Vengeance Strike (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>

					<p>If the vigilante uses any of these talents while in his social identity, he must succeed at a Disguise check against the Perception checks of all onlookers (without the +20 circumstance bonus from seamless guise) or the onlookers will realize that he is more than his social identity appears to be and perhaps discover the social and vigilante identities are one and the same. If a talent calls for a saving throw, the DC for that save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s level + the vigilante&#146;s Charisma modifier, unless stated otherwise.</p>

The foe also takes a &#150;4 penalty on attacks made against the vigilante until the start of the vigilante&#146;s next turn.</p>

Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Appearing to be an upstanding member of society, the cabalist clandestinely follows the tenets of a secret society. Practice with blood sacrifices, necromancy, and shadow magic gives a cabalist a reputation as a sinister and dangerous vigilante</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Life can be unfair. Think of the starving peasants forced to toil for the local baron or the common laborers tasked with building the king&#146;s newest palace for a mere handful of copper pieces each week. There are those who see these injustices and do nothing. There are those who are willing to reap the rewards obtained through the suffering of others. Then there are those who see inequality and find themselves driven to take action, outside the law if necessary. These vigilantes operate in plain sight, hiding behind respectable personas by day, but donning alternate guises by night to right the wrongs they see all around them.</p>
			<p>Not all vigilantes are out to make the world a better place. Some criminals hide behind the pretense of being ordinary folk, only to become terrors in the shadows, stealing and killing to fulfill some dark agenda. In either case, the vigilante is a character of two natures&#151;the face that everyone knows and the mask that inspires fear.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A vigilante can take on many tasks within a group. Most are skilled at negotiating delicate social situations and courtly intrigue, but they can also serve as stealthy spies or even brutish warriors in dangerous environments.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Vigilante's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Abilities</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Vigilantes are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, and shields (except tower shields). A cabalist is not proficient with medium armor. Like a magus, he can cast cabalist spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance.</p>
			<p><b>Dual Identity (Ex): </b>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante&#146;s true identity revealed to the world at large.</p>
			<p>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante&#146;s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user&#146;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p>
			<p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante&#146;s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#146;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante&#146;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>
			<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>
			<p><b>Seamless Guise (Ex) </b>: A vigilante knows how to behave in a way that appears perfectly proper and normal for his current identity. Should anyone suspect him of being anything other than what he appears to be while either in his social or vigilante identity, he can attempt a Disguise check with a +20 circumstance bonus to appear as his current identity, and not as his other identity.</p>
			<p><b>Social Talent: </b>Starting at 1st level, and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a social talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet other prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as having another social talent or attaining a minimum vigilante level. Once a talent has been chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Spellcasting: </b>A cabalist casts arcane spells and cantrips as a magus. He prepares spells using a spellbook, choosing them from the 6th-level and lower spells from the witch spell list; higher-level witch spells are not on the cabalist&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p>This replaces the 4th-, 8th-, 10th-, 14th-, and 16th-level vigilante talents.</p>
			<p><b>Spill Blood (Ex): </b>A cabalist can cause bleeding when he deals piercing or slashing damage with a melee attack (or a ranged attack within 30 feet) against a living foe who is unaware of his presence, who considers him an ally, or who is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC. The amount of bleed damage is equal to the cabalist&#146;s level. A cabalist can&#146;t deal this bleed damage to a creature with total concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Cabalist Talents: </b>A cabalist can select from the following vigilante talents, in addition to general vigilante talents. This alters vigilante talents.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Talent: </b>Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a vigilante talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as possessing another vigilante talent, possessing a particular specialization, or attaining a minimum level. Once a talent has been selected, it can&#146;t be changed.</p>
			<p>If the vigilante uses any of these talents while in his social identity, he must succeed at a Disguise check against the Perception checks of all onlookers (without the +20 circumstance bonus from seamless guise) or the onlookers will realize that he is more than his social identity appears to be and perhaps discover the social and vigilante identities are one and the same. If a talent calls for a saving throw, the DC for that save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s level + the vigilante&#146;s Charisma modifier, unless stated otherwise.</p>
			<p><b>Unshakable (Ex): </b>Starting at 3rd level, a vigilante adds his class level to the DC of any attempts to Intimidate him.</p>
			<p><b>Bloodbound Spell (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a cabalist gets an advantage when casting spells against bleeding foes. Whenever the cabalist casts a spell against a foe that is taking bleed damage, the foe takes a &#150;1 penalty on its saving throw against the spell (or to its AC if the spell requires an attack roll). This penalty increases to &#150;2 if the spell is from the necromancy school.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces startling appearance.</p>
			<p>Bloody Horror (Ex): At 11th level, when a cabalist casts a spell and one of the targets (or one creature in the area for an area spell) is taking bleed damage, the cabalist can, as a free action, make an Intimidate check to demoralize all targets of the spell (or all creatures in the area for an area spell). The cabalist rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets.</p>
			<p>Once a creature has been the target of this ability (regardless of whether or not it was successful), it is immune to that cabalist&#146;s bloody horror for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces frightening appearance.</p>
			<p><b>Shadowy Appearance (Sp): </b>At 17th level, a cabalist becomes cloaked in shadow while in his vigilante identity. He gains a continuous 20% miss chance (as per blur). The cabalist can deactivate or reactivate this effect as a standard action. Once per day, he can spend an immediate action to gain the benefits of greater invisibility for 1d6 rounds.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces stunning appearance</p>
			<p><b>Vengeance Strike (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>

				<name type="string">Brute Form</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Though it is sometimes difficult to maintain, a brute has a measure of control over his abilities.</p>
					<p>While in his vigilante identity, a brute becomes one size category larger, gaining no ability score adjustments but otherwise gaining all adjustments for his new size, including additional reach, if appropriate. A brute&#146;s vigilante identity is savage and dangerous. While in his vigilante identity, the brute takes a &#150;2 penalty to AC, as well as to all ability checks and skill checks that rely on Charisma, Dexterity, or Intelligence. Furthermore, the brute cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skill (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration (such as spellcasting). When a brute is in mortal peril, such as when combat starts, if he is in his social identity, he must succeed at a Will save (DC = 20 + 1/2 his vigilante level) or enter his vigilante identity. Entering his vigilante identity in this way is a horrifying and painful process that takes 1 full round, during which he is flat-footed, and it typically allows his enemies to see his transformation and learn his identity. The brute&#146;s vigilante identity can&#146;t always tell friend from foe. While he still attacks enemies preferentially during a battle, when there are no more enemies around, each round he must succeed at a Will save (DC = 20 + 1/2 his vigilante level) or continue fighting against his allies or bystanders. Allies can use the aid another action to assist this saving throw with skills like Diplomacy, as they attempt to calm him down. On a successful save, he slowly turns back to his social identity over the course of 1 minute (or shorter if he has a social talent that reduces that time).</p>
					<p>A brute uses his vigilante level as his base attack bonus, but only while he is in his vigilante identity. At 5th level, while in his vigilante identity, the brute gains a +1 bonus on melee attack and damage rolls. This bonus increases to +2 at 13th level and to +3 at 19th level. He uses his normal base attack bonus to qualify for feats and other abilities, although when in his vigilante identity, he uses his increased base attack bonus to determine the effects of feats (such as Power Attack) and other abilities.</p>
					<p>A brute&#146;s mundane clothes and armor do not increase in size with him, and any such items he wears while changing into his vigilante identity lose one-quarter of their hit points. Magical clothes and accessories increase in size with the vigilante, however (though his magical armor and weapons initially do not, as normal).</p>
					<p>A brute can stay in his vigilante identity for up to 2 hours at a time, for a total of up to 6 hours in a 24-hour period. When threatened in his vigilante identity, he has the potential to damage bystanders or allies. After switching from his vigilante identity to his social identity, he is fatigued for the same amount of time (rounds, minutes, or hours) that he spent in his vigilante identity and cannot remove or ignore this fatigue by any means except by waiting the appropriate amount of time. If he enters his vigilante identity while fatigued, once he switches back to his social identity, he becomes exhausted for the amount of time he just spent in his vigilante identity, and he also can&#146;t remove or ignore the exhaustion by any means other than waiting the appropriate length of time. A character with immunity to fatigue or exhaustion cannot adopt a brute form at all; that immunity prevents the transformation as an effect that would cause fatigue or exhaustion.</p>
					<p>An exhausted brute can only enter his vigilante identity for a number of rounds equal to half his vigilante level (minimum 1); following these rounds, the brute immediately falls unconscious, or into a stupor if he is somehow prevented from falling unconscious. In this state, a brute can be healed as normal (and, if he has 0 hit points or more, he returns to consciousness after receiving any amount of magical healing or a DC 15 Heal check), but he cannot enter his vigilante identity for 1 hour.</p>

					<p>At 11th level, whenever a vigilante with this ability makes an attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance above), the vigilante can, as a free action, attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of his attack and any enemies within 10 feet who can see the attack. This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets. If the check succeeds against the target of the vigilante&#146;s attack, that foe is also frightened for 1 round, in addition to being shaken as normal, unless the foe succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Either through the results of magical experimentation or bizarre natural sparks, some vigilantes can transform into brutish versions of themselves, becoming larger, more terrifying in appearance, and far more formidable in combat&#151;though at a price.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Life can be unfair. Think of the starving peasants forced to toil for the local baron or the common laborers tasked with building the king&#146;s newest palace for a mere handful of copper pieces each week. There are those who see these injustices and do nothing. There are those who are willing to reap the rewards obtained through the suffering of others. Then there are those who see inequality and find themselves driven to take action, outside the law if necessary. These vigilantes operate in plain sight, hiding behind respectable personas by day, but donning alternate guises by night to right the wrongs they see all around them.</p>
			<p>Not all vigilantes are out to make the world a better place. Some criminals hide behind the pretense of being ordinary folk, only to become terrors in the shadows, stealing and killing to fulfill some dark agenda. In either case, the vigilante is a character of two natures&#151;the face that everyone knows and the mask that inspires fear.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A vigilante can take on many tasks within a group. Most are skilled at negotiating delicate social situations and courtly intrigue, but they can also serve as stealthy spies or even brutish warriors in dangerous environments.</p>

			<h>Class Abilities</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Vigilantes are proficient with all simple, light armor, and shields (except tower shields). A brute isn&#146;t proficient with medium armor or martial weapons. However, he gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Brutish Fortitude (Ex): </b>A brute&#146;s base Fortitude save bonus from his vigilante levels is equal to 2 + half his vigilante level, and his base Reflex and Will save bonuses are equal to 1/3 his vigilante level.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic Vigilante (Ex): </b>A brute&#146;s vigilante alignment must be chaotic, and his vigilante identity and his social identity must be within one step of each other on the alignment axis.</p>
			<p>This ability alters dual identity.</p>
			<p><b>Dual Identity (Ex): </b>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante&#146;s true identity revealed to the world at large.</p>
			<p>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante&#146;s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user&#146;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p>
			<p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante&#146;s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#146;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante&#146;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>
			<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>
			<p><b>Seamless Guise (Ex) </b>: A vigilante knows how to behave in a way that appears perfectly proper and normal for his current identity. Should anyone suspect him of being anything other than what he appears to be while either in his social or vigilante identity, he can attempt a Disguise check with a +20 circumstance bonus to appear as his current identity, and not as his other identity.</p>
			<p><b>Social Talent: </b>Starting at 1st level, and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a social talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet other prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as having another social talent or attaining a minimum vigilante level. Once a talent has been chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Brute Form (Ex): </b>Though it is sometimes difficult to maintain, a brute has a measure of control over his abilities.</p>
			<p>While in his vigilante identity, a brute becomes one size category larger, gaining no ability score adjustments but otherwise gaining all adjustments for his new size, including additional reach, if appropriate. A brute&#146;s vigilante identity is savage and dangerous. While in his vigilante identity, the brute takes a &#150;2 penalty to AC, as well as to all ability checks and skill checks that rely on Charisma, Dexterity, or Intelligence. Furthermore, the brute cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skill (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration (such as spellcasting). When a brute is in mortal peril, such as when combat starts, if he is in his social identity, he must succeed at a Will save (DC = 20 + 1/2 his vigilante level) or enter his vigilante identity. Entering his vigilante identity in this way is a horrifying and painful process that takes 1 full round, during which he is flat-footed, and it typically allows his enemies to see his transformation and learn his identity. The brute&#146;s vigilante identity can&#146;t always tell friend from foe. While he still attacks enemies preferentially during a battle, when there are no more enemies around, each round he must succeed at a Will save (DC = 20 + 1/2 his vigilante level) or continue fighting against his allies or bystanders. Allies can use the aid another action to assist this saving throw with skills like Diplomacy, as they attempt to calm him down. On a successful save, he slowly turns back to his social identity over the course of 1 minute (or shorter if he has a social talent that reduces that time).</p>
			<p>A brute uses his vigilante level as his base attack bonus, but only while he is in his vigilante identity. At 5th level, while in his vigilante identity, the brute gains a +1 bonus on melee attack and damage rolls. This bonus increases to +2 at 13th level and to +3 at 19th level. He uses his normal base attack bonus to qualify for feats and other abilities, although when in his vigilante identity, he uses his increased base attack bonus to determine the effects of feats (such as Power Attack) and other abilities.</p>
			<p>A brute&#146;s mundane clothes and armor do not increase in size with him, and any such items he wears while changing into his vigilante identity lose one-quarter of their hit points. Magical clothes and accessories increase in size with the vigilante, however (though his magical armor and weapons initially do not, as normal).</p>
			<p>A brute can stay in his vigilante identity for up to 2 hours at a time, for a total of up to 6 hours in a 24-hour period. When threatened in his vigilante identity, he has the potential to damage bystanders or allies. After switching from his vigilante identity to his social identity, he is fatigued for the same amount of time (rounds, minutes, or hours) that he spent in his vigilante identity and cannot remove or ignore this fatigue by any means except by waiting the appropriate amount of time. If he enters his vigilante identity while fatigued, once he switches back to his social identity, he becomes exhausted for the amount of time he just spent in his vigilante identity, and he also can&#146;t remove or ignore the exhaustion by any means other than waiting the appropriate length of time. A character with immunity to fatigue or exhaustion cannot adopt a brute form at all; that immunity prevents the transformation as an effect that would cause fatigue or exhaustion.</p>
			<p>An exhausted brute can only enter his vigilante identity for a number of rounds equal to half his vigilante level (minimum 1); following these rounds, the brute immediately falls unconscious, or into a stupor if he is somehow prevented from falling unconscious. In this state, a brute can be healed as normal (and, if he has 0 hit points or more, he returns to consciousness after receiving any amount of magical healing or a DC 15 Heal check), but he cannot enter his vigilante identity for 1 hour.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces vigilante specialization.</p>
			<p><b>Brute Talents: </b>A brute can select from any of the following vigilante talents, in addition to general vigilante talents.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Talent: </b>Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a vigilante talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as possessing another vigilante talent, possessing a particular specialization, or attaining a minimum level. Once a talent has been selected, it can&#146;t be changed.</p>
			<p>If the vigilante uses any of these talents while in his social identity, he must succeed at a Disguise check against the Perception checks of all onlookers (without the +20 circumstance bonus from seamless guise) or the onlookers will realize that he is more than his social identity appears to be and perhaps discover the social and vigilante identities are one and the same. If a talent calls for a saving throw, the DC for that save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s level + the vigilante&#146;s Charisma modifier, unless stated otherwise.</p>
			<p><b>Unshakable (Ex): </b>Starting at 3rd level, a vigilante adds his class level to the DC of any attempts to Intimidate him.</p>
			<p><b>Startling Appearance (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a vigilante learns to use the element of surprise to his advantage, startling foes that are unaware of his presence. Whenever a vigilante with this ability attempts an attack against a foe that is completely unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (usually due to Stealth or invisibility), the foe is treated as flat-footed for the rest of the vigilante&#146;s turn (uncanny dodge or a similar ability prevents this effect unless the vigilante is at least 4 levels higher than the foe with uncanny dodge). The foe also takes a &#150;4 penalty on attacks made against the vigilante until the start of the vigilante&#146;s next turn.</p>
			<p><b>Frightening Appearance (Ex): </b>At 11th level, whenever a vigilante with this ability makes an attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance above), the vigilante can, as a free action, attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of his attack and any enemies within 10 feet who can see the attack. This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets. If the check succeeds against the target of the vigilante&#146;s attack, that foe is also frightened for 1 round, in addition to being shaken as normal, unless the foe succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier).</p>
			<p>Once a creature has been the target of this ability (either as the target of the attack or as a nearby creature, regardless of whether or not it was successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s frightening appearance for 24 hours. This effect is in addition to the bonuses gained from the startling appearance ability. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Stunning Appearance (Ex) </b>: At 17th level, a vigilante can leave his foes unable to respond when he appears. Whenever a vigilante with this ability makes a successful attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance), the foe must make a successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier) or be stunned until the end of the vigilante&#146;s next turn. If the creature has more HD than the vigilante&#146;s class level, it receives a +4 circumstance bonus on this save. This ability is in addition to the effects of startling appearance and frightening appearance. Once a creature has been the target of this ability (regardless of whether or not the saving throw is successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s stunning appearance for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Tear Them Apart (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a brute has learned how to tear at his enemies&#146; bodies when he hits with multiple attacks. When he takes a full attack action while in his vigilante identity, if a brute hits an opponent with at least two attacks, he deals an additional 1d10 points of damage plus 1-1/2 times his Strength modifier. If he hits an opponent with four attacks during a full attack action while in his vigilante identity, he instead deals an additional 3d10 points of damage plus 1-1/2 times his Strength modifier. The damage occurs after he has taken his last attack with the full attack action. This counts as a rend and does not stack with other abilities that grant rend.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces vengeance strike.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Bellflower harvesters are the front-line operatives of the secretive Bellflower Network, whose members infiltrate Chelish estates in the guise of servants and slaves, and tolerate a harsh life as they uncover secrets, gauge security, and send slaves on the first steps toward freedom. While Bellflower tillers (see page 40) wander the countryside, escorting the crop of escapees to freedom, Bellflower harvesters remain in seeming bondage to direct others to the road to freedom, undermine efforts to recapture slaves, and end the threat of especially vile masters. Bellflower harvesters consist almost exclusively of halflings, though the role could be taken by anyone with the patience or humility to withstand months or years of cruel abuse without risking being caught raising a hand in his own defense.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Life can be unfair. Think of the starving peasants forced to toil for the local baron or the common laborers tasked with building the king&#146;s newest palace for a mere handful of copper pieces each week. There are those who see these injustices and do nothing. There are those who are willing to reap the rewards obtained through the suffering of others. Then there are those who see inequality and find themselves driven to take action, outside the law if necessary. These vigilantes operate in plain sight, hiding behind respectable personas by day, but donning alternate guises by night to right the wrongs they see all around them.</p>
			<p>Not all vigilantes are out to make the world a better place. Some criminals hide behind the pretense of being ordinary folk, only to become terrors in the shadows, stealing and killing to fulfill some dark agenda. In either case, the vigilante is a character of two natures&#151;the face that everyone knows and the mask that inspires fear.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A vigilante can take on many tasks within a group. Most are skilled at negotiating delicate social situations and courtly intrigue, but they can also serve as stealthy spies or even brutish warriors in dangerous environments.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Vigilante's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Abilities</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Vigilantes are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Bellflower Crop (Ex): </b>As a standard action, a Bellflower harvester can designate a number of allies equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier as part of his Bellflower crop. Members of a Bellflower crop must remain within 30 feet of the vigilante to gain any benefits from abilities that affect a Bellflower crop, regardless of the ability&#146;s source (whether it&#146;s a Bellflower harvester, irrigator, or tiller). If the allies leave this range, the Bellflower harvester must designate them again to include them in his crop.</p>
			<p><b>Crop Vigilance (Ex): </b>When the Bellflower harvester uses the aid another action to grant a member of his Bellflower crop a bonus on an attack roll against an opponent, on a skill check, or to AC against an opponent&#146;s next attack, the bonus increases to +3. This doesn&#146;t stack with the benefits of other feats or class features that improve the bonus he grants to an ally with aid another. At 5th level and every 6 vigilante levels thereafter, the bonus that the Bellflower harvester provides when using aid another to assist a member of his Bellflower crop increases by 1, to a maximum of +6 at 17th level.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces vigilante specialization, but the Bellflower harvester is still treated as if he had the stalker specialization for the purpose of selecting other vigilante talents.</p>
			<p><b>Dual Identity (Ex): </b>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante&#146;s true identity revealed to the world at large.</p>
			<p>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante&#146;s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user&#146;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p>
			<p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante&#146;s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#146;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante&#146;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>
			<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>
			<p><b>Obsequious (Ex): </b>A Bellflower harvester works hard to cultivate a social identity that plays off others&#146; racist assumptions to deflect blame and excuse suspicious behavior, making him seem harmless or even a model servant. He can use the Bluff skill to deflect suspicion about his vigilante identity and activities (including use of vigilante talents when in his social identity) rather than Disguise, and gains a +2 bonus on Bluff checks to do so. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 vigilante levels he has beyond 1st, to a maximum of +6 at 17th level.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the social talent gained at 1st level.</p>
			<p><b>Rebellious Identity (Ex): </b>A Bellflower harvester&#146;s vigilante identity must be within one step of chaotic good, and his social identity must appear to be a servant, slave, or other menial laborer.</p>
			<p>This alters dual identity.</p>
			<p><b>Seamless Guise (Ex) </b>: A vigilante knows how to behave in a way that appears perfectly proper and normal for his current identity. Should anyone suspect him of being anything other than what he appears to be while either in his social or vigilante identity, he can attempt a Disguise check with a +20 circumstance bonus to appear as his current identity, and not as his other identity.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Specialization (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a vigilante must choose to be either an avenger or a stalker.</p>
			<p>An avenger gains a base attack bonus equal to his vigilante level instead of using those listed on Table 1&#150;1. He adds this value to any other base attack bonus gained from other classes or racial Hit Dice as normal.</p>
			<p>A stalker gains an ability called hidden strike, which allows him to deal an extra 1d8 points of precision damage on melee attacks (or ranged attacks from within 30 feet) against foes who are unaware of his presence, who consider him an ally, or who are made flat-footed by startling appearance (see page 17). This extra damage increases by 1d8 at 3rd level and every 2 vigilante levels thereafter. A stalker vigilante can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that he is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage dice are reduced to d4s. A stalker can deal hidden strike damage against targets with concealment (but not total concealment).</p>
			<p>Once this choice is made, it can&#146;t be changed. While many vigilante talents are usable by both specializations, some are unique to each specialization. A stalker vigilante can apply only one talent marked with an asterisk (*) to a given hidden strike, and only when that hidden strike is dealt against a foe that is unaware of the stalker vigilante&#146;s presence (or who considers him an ally), unless otherwise noted.</p>
			<p><b>Tend the Garden (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a Bellflower harvester gains the ability to coordinate the members of his Bellflower crop to improve their performance in battle. He gains Stealth SynergyUC as a bonus feat. As a standard action, a Bellflower harvester can grant any one teamwork feat he has to all members of his Bellflower crop who can see and hear him. Members of his Bellflower crop retain this feat for 1 round, plus 1 round for every 5 vigilante levels the Bellflower harvester has beyond 2nd, to a maximum of 4 rounds at 17th level. A Bellflower harvester can share only one teamwork feat at a time in this manner.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the vigilante talent gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Social Talent: </b>Starting at 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a social talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet other prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as having another social talent or attaining a minimum vigilante level. Once a talent has been chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Unshakable (Ex): </b>Starting at 3rd level, a vigilante adds his class level to the DC of any attempts to Intimidate him.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Talent: </b>Starting at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a vigilante talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as possessing another vigilante talent, possessing a particular specialization, or attaining a minimum level. Once a talent has been selected, it can&#146;t be changed.</p>
			<p>If the vigilante uses any of these talents while in his social identity, he must succeed at a Disguise check against the Perception checks of all onlookers (without the +20 circumstance bonus from seamless guise) or the onlookers will realize that he is more than his social identity appears to be and perhaps discover the social and vigilante identities are one and the same. If a talent calls for a saving throw, the DC for that save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s level + the vigilante&#146;s Charisma modifier, unless stated otherwise.</p>
			<p><b>Startling Appearance (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a vigilante learns to use the element of surprise to his advantage, startling foes that are unaware of his presence. Whenever a vigilante with this ability attempts an attack against a foe that is completely unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (usually due to Stealth or invisibility), the foe is treated as flat-footed for the rest of the vigilante&#146;s turn (uncanny dodge or a similar ability prevents this effect unless the vigilante is at least 4 levels higher than the foe with uncanny dodge). The foe also takes a &#150;4 penalty on attacks made against the vigilante until the start of the vigilante&#146;s next turn.</p>
			<p><b>Frightening Appearance (Ex): </b>At 11th level, whenever a vigilante with this ability makes an attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance above), the vigilante can, as a free action, attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of his attack and any enemies within 10 feet who can see the attack. This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets. If the check succeeds against the target of the vigilante&#146;s attack, that foe is also frightened for 1 round, in addition to being shaken as normal, unless the foe succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier).</p>
			<p>Once a creature has been the target of this ability (either as the target of the attack or as a nearby creature, regardless of whether or not it was successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s frightening appearance for 24 hours. This effect is in addition to the bonuses gained from the startling appearance ability. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Stunning Appearance (Ex) </b>: At 17th level, a vigilante can leave his foes unable to respond when he appears. Whenever a vigilante with this ability makes a successful attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance), the foe must make a successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier) or be stunned until the end of the vigilante&#146;s next turn. If the creature has more HD than the vigilante&#146;s class level, it receives a +4 circumstance bonus on this save. This ability is in addition to the effects of startling appearance and frightening appearance. Once a creature has been the target of this ability (regardless of whether or not the saving throw is successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s stunning appearance for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Vengeance Strike (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made.

Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante&#146;s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user&#146;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p>
					<p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante&#146;s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#146;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante&#146;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>
					<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some vigilantes turn to natural traditions and supernatural forces to transform into beasts, unleashing a primal fury on their foes before returning to an ordinary guise.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Life can be unfair. Think of the starving peasants forced to toil for the local baron or the common laborers tasked with building the king&#146;s newest palace for a mere handful of copper pieces each week. There are those who see these injustices and do nothing. There are those who are willing to reap the rewards obtained through the suffering of others. Then there are those who see inequality and find themselves driven to take action, outside the law if necessary. These vigilantes operate in plain sight, hiding behind respectable personas by day, but donning alternate guises by night to right the wrongs they see all around them.</p>
			<p>Not all vigilantes are out to make the world a better place. Some criminals hide behind the pretense of being ordinary folk, only to become terrors in the shadows, stealing and killing to fulfill some dark agenda. In either case, the vigilante is a character of two natures&#151;the face that everyone knows and the mask that inspires fear.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A vigilante can take on many tasks within a group. Most are skilled at negotiating delicate social situations and courtly intrigue, but they can also serve as stealthy spies or even brutish warriors in dangerous environments.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Vigilante's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Abilities</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Vigilantes are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Animal Mask (Ex): </b>An avenging beast gains an ornate animal-headed mask that is a focus for his power and must be worn when assuming his vigilante identity. This mask symbolizes one specific animal, and the animal cannot be changed once chosen. Without this mask, an avenging beast cannot assume his vigilante identity. An avenging beast who loses his mask can replace it after 1 week through a specialized ritual that takes 8 hours to complete and costs 200 gp per avenging beast level.</p>
			<p>This alters dual identity.</p>
			<p><b>Dual Identity (Ex): </b>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante&#146;s true identity revealed to the world at large.</p>
			<p>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante&#146;s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user&#146;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p>
			<p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante&#146;s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#146;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante&#146;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>
			<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>
			<p><b>Seamless Guise (Ex) </b>: A vigilante knows how to behave in a way that appears perfectly proper and normal for his current identity. Should anyone suspect him of being anything other than what he appears to be while either in his social or vigilante identity, he can attempt a Disguise check with a +20 circumstance bonus to appear as his current identity, and not as his other identity.</p>
			<p><b>Social Talent: </b>Starting at 1st level, and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a social talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet other prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as having another social talent or attaining a minimum vigilante level. Once a talent has been chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Spellcasting: </b>An avenging beast casts divine spells as a hunter and uses the hunter&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p>This replaces the vigilante talents gained at 4th, 8th, 10th, 14th, and 16th level.</p>
			<p><b>Patron Spells: </b>An avenging beast selects a patron from the witch patron list and adds the patron bonus spells to his spell list (up to 6th-level spells). Patron spells of 7th level or higher are not counted as being on the avenging beast&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p>This replaces vigilante specialization.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Talent: </b>Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a vigilante talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as possessing another vigilante talent, possessing a particular specialization, or attaining a minimum level. Once a talent has been selected, it can&#146;t be changed.</p>
			<p>If the vigilante uses any of these talents while in his social identity, he must succeed at a Disguise check against the Perception checks of all onlookers (without the +20 circumstance bonus from seamless guise) or the onlookers will realize that he is more than his social identity appears to be and perhaps discover the social and vigilante identities are one and the same. If a talent calls for a saving throw, the DC for that save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s level + the vigilante&#146;s Charisma modifier, unless stated otherwise.</p>
			<p><b>Unshakable (Ex): </b>Starting at 3rd level, a vigilante adds his class level to the DC of any attempts to Intimidate him.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su): </b>At 5th level, when in his vigilante identity, the avenging beast gains the ability to take on the shape of the animal represented by his animal mask. This ability functions identically to the druid&#146;s wild shape ability, except the ability does not improve beyond functioning as beast shape I. The avenging beast treats his vigilante level as his druid level for the purposes of this ability. An avenging beast can use wild shape once per day at 5th level and one additional time per day at 7th level and every 2 levels thereafter, for a total of eight times per day at 19th level.</p>
			<p>This replaces startling appearance, frightening appearance, and stunning appearance.</p>
			<p><b>Vengeance Strike (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>

					<p>At 7th level, an Anaphexia thought-killer can smell a significant thought. As a standard action, she can choose one fact or idea she already knows, such as a secret she wishes to keep hidden, and can locate any creature within 30 feet who knows it as with the scent ability. The range increases to 60 feet if the creature is upwind and drops to 15 feet if the creature is downwind. She can discern the direction to the creature until she is adjacent, at which point she can pinpoint the creature&#146;s square. This is a mind-affecting divination effect. The Anaphexia thought-killer can use this ability for up to 1 minute per level. These minutes need not be consecutive but must be used in 1-minute intervals.</p>

				<name type="string">Vigilante Specialization</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a vigilante must choose to be either an avenger or a stalker.</p>
					<p>An avenger gains a base attack bonus equal to his vigilante level instead of using those listed on Table 1&#150;1. He adds this value to any other base attack bonus gained from other classes or racial Hit Dice as normal.</p>
					<p>A stalker gains an ability called hidden strike, which allows him to deal an extra 1d8 points of precision damage on melee attacks (or ranged attacks from within 30 feet) against foes who are unaware of his presence, who consider him an ally, or who are made flat-footed by startling appearance (see page 17). This extra damage increases by 1d8 at 3rd level and every 2 vigilante levels thereafter. A stalker vigilante can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that he is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage dice are reduced to d4s. A stalker can deal hidden strike damage against targets with concealment (but not total concealment).</p>
					<p>Once this choice is made, it can&#146;t be changed. While many vigilante talents are usable by both specializations, some are unique to each specialization. A stalker vigilante can apply only one talent marked with an asterisk (*) to a given hidden strike, and only when that hidden strike is dealt against a foe that is unaware of the stalker vigilante&#146;s presence (or who considers him an ally), unless otherwise noted.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Anaphexia thought-killers worship Norgorber&#146;s Reaper of Reputation aspect from their secret home in Ustalav. In sacrifice to him, they cut out their own tongues to gain magical protection from exposure and hunt down secrets to steal before they can be spread&#151;which usually requires executing those who already knew them.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Life can be unfair. Think of the starving peasants forced to toil for the local baron or the common laborers tasked with building the king&#146;s newest palace for a mere handful of copper pieces each week. There are those who see these injustices and do nothing. There are those who are willing to reap the rewards obtained through the suffering of others. Then there are those who see inequality and find themselves driven to take action, outside the law if necessary. These vigilantes operate in plain sight, hiding behind respectable personas by day, but donning alternate guises by night to right the wrongs they see all around them.</p>
			<p>Not all vigilantes are out to make the world a better place. Some criminals hide behind the pretense of being ordinary folk, only to become terrors in the shadows, stealing and killing to fulfill some dark agenda. In either case, the vigilante is a character of two natures&#151;the face that everyone knows and the mask that inspires fear.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A vigilante can take on many tasks within a group. Most are skilled at negotiating delicate social situations and courtly intrigue, but they can also serve as stealthy spies or even brutish warriors in dangerous environments.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Vigilante's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Abilities</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Vigilantes are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Dual Identity (Ex): </b>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante&#146;s true identity revealed to the world at large.</p>
			<p>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante&#146;s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user&#146;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p>
			<p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante&#146;s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#146;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante&#146;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>
			<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>
			<p><b>Seamless Guise (Ex) </b>: A vigilante knows how to behave in a way that appears perfectly proper and normal for his current identity. Should anyone suspect him of being anything other than what he appears to be while either in his social or vigilante identity, he can attempt a Disguise check with a +20 circumstance bonus to appear as his current identity, and not as his other identity.</p>
			<p><b>Tongue Sacrifice (Su): </b>An Anaphexia thought-killer&#146;s social identity is as a Pharasmin priest, one whom many people assume has taken a vow of silence since they speak so infrequently. In order to assume her vigilante identity, an Anaphexia thought-killer must cut out her own tongue as a standard action&#151;an act that deals 1d4 points of damage plus 1 point of bleed damage and leaves her unable to speak (even to cast spells). The thought-killer gains the ability to cast regenerate as a spell-like ability once per day, and only to restore her own tongue.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Specialization (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a vigilante must choose to be either an avenger or a stalker.</p>
			<p>An avenger gains a base attack bonus equal to his vigilante level instead of using those listed on Table 1&#150;1. He adds this value to any other base attack bonus gained from other classes or racial Hit Dice as normal.</p>
			<p>A stalker gains an ability called hidden strike, which allows him to deal an extra 1d8 points of precision damage on melee attacks (or ranged attacks from within 30 feet) against foes who are unaware of his presence, who consider him an ally, or who are made flat-footed by startling appearance (see page 17). This extra damage increases by 1d8 at 3rd level and every 2 vigilante levels thereafter. A stalker vigilante can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that he is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage dice are reduced to d4s. A stalker can deal hidden strike damage against targets with concealment (but not total concealment).</p>
			<p>Once this choice is made, it can&#146;t be changed. While many vigilante talents are usable by both specializations, some are unique to each specialization. A stalker vigilante can apply only one talent marked with an asterisk (*) to a given hidden strike, and only when that hidden strike is dealt against a foe that is unaware of the stalker vigilante&#146;s presence (or who considers him an ally), unless otherwise noted.</p>
			<p><b>Monastic Communication (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, an Anaphexia thought-killer is skilled at maintaining a disguise without speaking. She can communicate simple concepts through body language and pantomime as though passing a secret message using the Bluff skill, in half the time normally required to do so. The Anaphexia thought-killer gains a bonus on this check equal to 1/2 her vigilante level.</p>
			<p>This replaces the social talent gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Social Talent: </b>Starting at 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a social talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet other prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as having another social talent or attaining a minimum vigilante level. Once a talent has been chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Unshakable (Ex): </b>Starting at 3rd level, a vigilante adds his class level to the DC of any attempts to Intimidate him.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Talent: </b>Starting at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a vigilante talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as possessing another vigilante talent, possessing a particular specialization, or attaining a minimum level. Once a talent has been selected, it can&#146;t be changed.</p>
			<p>If the vigilante uses any of these talents while in his social identity, he must succeed at a Disguise check against the Perception checks of all onlookers (without the +20 circumstance bonus from seamless guise) or the onlookers will realize that he is more than his social identity appears to be and perhaps discover the social and vigilante identities are one and the same. If a talent calls for a saving throw, the DC for that save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s level + the vigilante&#146;s Charisma modifier, unless stated otherwise.</p>
			<p><b>Startling Appearance (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a vigilante learns to use the element of surprise to his advantage, startling foes that are unaware of his presence. Whenever a vigilante with this ability attempts an attack against a foe that is completely unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (usually due to Stealth or invisibility), the foe is treated as flat-footed for the rest of the vigilante&#146;s turn (uncanny dodge or a similar ability prevents this effect unless the vigilante is at least 4 levels higher than the foe with uncanny dodge). The foe also takes a &#150;4 penalty on attacks made against the vigilante until the start of the vigilante&#146;s next turn.</p>
			<p><b>Silent to Magic (Su): </b>At 6th level, an Anaphexia thought-killer is protected by nondetection in her social identity but only against mind-reading effects. Her effective caster level is equal to her vigilante level. At 10th level, this protection also applies to the thought-killer&#146;s vigilante identity.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the social talent gained at 6th level.</p>
			<p><b>Thought-Scent (Su): </b>At 7th level, an Anaphexia thought-killer can smell a significant thought. As a standard action, she can choose one fact or idea she already knows, such as a secret she wishes to keep hidden, and can locate any creature within 30 feet who knows it as with the scent ability. The range increases to 60 feet if the creature is upwind and drops to 15 feet if the creature is downwind. She can discern the direction to the creature until she is adjacent, at which point she can pinpoint the creature&#146;s square. This is a mind-affecting divination effect. The Anaphexia thought-killer can use this ability for up to 1 minute per level. These minutes need not be consecutive but must be used in 1-minute intervals.</p>
			<p>This replaces the vigilante talent gained at 7th level.</p>
			<p><b>Frightening Appearance (Ex): </b>At 11th level, whenever a vigilante with this ability makes an attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance above), the vigilante can, as a free action, attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of his attack and any enemies within 10 feet who can see the attack. This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets. If the check succeeds against the target of the vigilante&#146;s attack, that foe is also frightened for 1 round, in addition to being shaken as normal, unless the foe succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier).</p>
			<p>Once a creature has been the target of this ability (either as the target of the attack or as a nearby creature, regardless of whether or not it was successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s frightening appearance for 24 hours. This effect is in addition to the bonuses gained from the startling appearance ability. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>False Reading (Su): </b>At 15th level, an Anaphexia thought-killer is immune to all effects attempting to read her mind in both her social and vigilante identities. The Anaphexia thought-killer can attempt a Bluff check to provide false results to the creature attempting to read her thoughts, which the target can see through with a successful opposed Sense Motive check.</p>
			<p>This replaces the vigilante talent gained at 15th level.</p>
			<p><b>Stunning Appearance (Ex) </b>: At 17th level, a vigilante can leave his foes unable to respond when he appears. Whenever a vigilante with this ability makes a successful attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance), the foe must make a successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier) or be stunned until the end of the vigilante&#146;s next turn. If the creature has more HD than the vigilante&#146;s class level, it receives a +4 circumstance bonus on this save. This ability is in addition to the effects of startling appearance and frightening appearance. Once a creature has been the target of this ability (regardless of whether or not the saving throw is successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s stunning appearance for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Vengeance Strike (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>

Should anyone suspect him of being anything other than what he appears to be while either in his social or vigilante identity, he can attempt a Disguise check with a +20 circumstance bonus to appear as his current identity, and not as his other identity.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a vigilante must choose to be either an avenger or a stalker.</p>
					<p>An avenger gains a base attack bonus equal to his vigilante level instead of using those listed on Table 1&#150;1. He adds this value to any other base attack bonus gained from other classes or racial Hit Dice as normal.</p>
					<p>A stalker gains an ability called hidden strike, which allows him to deal an extra 1d8 points of precision damage on melee attacks (or ranged attacks from within 30 feet) against foes who are unaware of his presence, who consider him an ally, or who are made flat-footed by startling appearance (see page 17). This extra damage increases by 1d8 at 3rd level and every 2 vigilante levels thereafter. A stalker vigilante can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that he is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage dice are reduced to d4s. A stalker can deal hidden strike damage against targets with concealment (but not total concealment).</p>
					<p>Once this choice is made, it can&#146;t be changed. While many vigilante talents are usable by both specializations, some are unique to each specialization. A stalker vigilante can apply only one talent marked with an asterisk (*) to a given hidden strike, and only when that hidden strike is dealt against a foe that is unaware of the stalker vigilante&#146;s presence (or who considers him an ally), unless otherwise noted.</p>

This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets. If the check succeeds against the target of the vigilante&#146;s attack, that foe is also frightened for 1 round, in addition to being shaken as normal, unless the foe succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier).</p>

					<p>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>

The bonus provided by seamless guise still applies to the vigilante&#146;s attempts to appear to be an ordinary animal. Once the vigilante&#146;s animal form is selected, it cannot be changed.</p>
					<p>Beginning at 4th level, when an agathiel assumes his vigilante identity, he physically transforms into an animal, though he always retains unusual traits that set him apart from ordinary animals, as if using beast shape I, except the vigilante gains no ability adjustments and can select only a single animal ability from those listed in the spell&#146;s description. His social identity remains his true form, and unlike with beast shape I, an agathiel can remain in his animal form indefinitely. The agathiel&#146;s vigilante identity is considered a polymorph effect, and while in his vigilante identity, the agathiel is immune to other polymorph effects. Unlike with normal polymorph effects, the agathiel&#146;s equipment does not meld into his form, and instead changes shape to fit his animal form and provides the same function, though any equipment requiring hands cannot be used until he returns to his social identity.</p>
					<p>At 8th level, when assuming his vigilante identity, the vigilante can select two abilities provided by beast shape I, or select a single ability provided by beast shape II.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The legends of Golarion teem with intelligent beasts who emerge from the wild to right wrongs perpetrated by a nation, aid a virtuous family, or extract long-overdue vengeance. Many of these trace back to the agathiel tradition, first stolen from agathion celestials by the elves of Kyonin and again later by Old-Mage Jatembe. Agathiels surrender a portion of their immortal souls to Nirvana in exchange for a measure of animalistic might to aid them in their righteous crusades. This exchange is permanent, and each agathiel commits the rest of his mortal life to service of others and the constant thrum of wild instincts. Though agathiels can be found in small numbers all over Golarion, the rituals to transform a mortal into an agathiel are common only in Kyonin and the Mwangi city-states, and among the wandering scholars of the Mwangi Expanse. The elves in particular relied upon these abilities to scout Golarion before reclaiming their abandoned territories after the Age of Darkness, leading to reports of extraordinary fey animals stalking elven ruins in the century before their return.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Life can be unfair. Think of the starving peasants forced to toil for the local baron or the common laborers tasked with building the king&#146;s newest palace for a mere handful of copper pieces each week. There are those who see these injustices and do nothing. There are those who are willing to reap the rewards obtained through the suffering of others. Then there are those who see inequality and find themselves driven to take action, outside the law if necessary. These vigilantes operate in plain sight, hiding behind respectable personas by day, but donning alternate guises by night to right the wrongs they see all around them.</p>
			<p>Not all vigilantes are out to make the world a better place. Some criminals hide behind the pretense of being ordinary folk, only to become terrors in the shadows, stealing and killing to fulfill some dark agenda. In either case, the vigilante is a character of two natures&#151;the face that everyone knows and the mask that inspires fear.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A vigilante can take on many tasks within a group. Most are skilled at negotiating delicate social situations and courtly intrigue, but they can also serve as stealthy spies or even brutish warriors in dangerous environments.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Vigilante's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<p>Beginning at 4th level, when an agathiel assumes his vigilante identity, he physically transforms into an animal, though he always retains unusual traits that set him apart from ordinary animals, as if using beast shape I, except the vigilante gains no ability adjustments and can select only a single animal ability from those listed in the spell&#146;s description. His social identity remains his true form, and unlike with beast shape I, an agathiel can remain in his animal form indefinitely. The agathiel&#146;s vigilante identity is considered a polymorph effect, and while in his vigilante identity, the agathiel is immune to other polymorph effects. Unlike with normal polymorph effects, the agathiel&#146;s equipment does not meld into his form, and instead changes shape to fit his animal form and provides the same function, though any equipment requiring hands cannot be used until he returns to his social identity.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, when assuming his vigilante identity, the vigilante can select two abilities provided by beast shape I, or select a single ability provided by beast shape II. At 12th level, he can instead select two abilities provided by beast shape II, or a single ability provided by beast shape III. At 16th level, he can instead select three abilities provided by beast shape III, or a single ability provided by beast shape IV.</p>
			<p>This ability alters dual identity and replaces the vigilante talents gained at 4th, 8th, 12th, and 16th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Dual Identity (Ex): </b>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante&#146;s true identity revealed to the world at large.</p>
			<p>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante&#146;s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user&#146;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.</p>
			<p>Despite being a single person, a vigilante&#146;s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#146;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante&#146;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>
			<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>
			<p><b>Immortal Commitment (Su): </b>Becoming an agathiel commits a portion of the vigilante&#146;s soul to Nirvana, and in turn invests him with a portion of the plane&#146;s power. An agathiel&#146;s social and vigilante identity alignments must both be within one step of neutral good. If either of the agathiel&#146;s alignments moves outside this range (because of his own actions or magical manipulation), he gains 1 permanent negative level and loses the ability to assume his vigilante identity until both of his alignments are within one step of neutral good. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration spells) until the agathiel&#146;s alignment reverts.</p>
			<p><b>Seamless Guise (Ex) </b>: A vigilante knows how to behave in a way that appears perfectly proper and normal for his current identity. Should anyone suspect him of being anything other than what he appears to be while either in his social or vigilante identity, he can attempt a Disguise check with a +20 circumstance bonus to appear as his current identity, and not as his other identity.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Specialization (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a vigilante must choose to be either an avenger or a stalker.</p>
			<p>An avenger gains a base attack bonus equal to his vigilante level instead of using those listed on Table 1&#150;1. He adds this value to any other base attack bonus gained from other classes or racial Hit Dice as normal.</p>
			<p>A stalker gains an ability called hidden strike, which allows him to deal an extra 1d8 points of precision damage on melee attacks (or ranged attacks from within 30 feet) against foes who are unaware of his presence, who consider him an ally, or who are made flat-footed by startling appearance (see page 17). This extra damage increases by 1d8 at 3rd level and every 2 vigilante levels thereafter. A stalker vigilante can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that he is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage dice are reduced to d4s. A stalker can deal hidden strike damage against targets with concealment (but not total concealment).</p>
			<p>Once this choice is made, it can&#146;t be changed. While many vigilante talents are usable by both specializations, some are unique to each specialization. A stalker vigilante can apply only one talent marked with an asterisk (*) to a given hidden strike, and only when that hidden strike is dealt against a foe that is unaware of the stalker vigilante&#146;s presence (or who considers him an ally), unless otherwise noted.</p>
			<p><b>Agathion Blessing (Su): </b>Beginning at 2nd level, an agathiel gains Aspect of the BeastAPG as a bonus feat while in his vigilante identity. If he selects the claws of the beast option, he can select a bite attack (1d8), a gore attack (1d8), or 2 slam attacks (1d4 each), as appropriate to his animal identity.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the vigilante talent gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Social Talent: </b>Starting at 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a social talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet other prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as having another social talent or attaining a minimum vigilante level. Once a talent has been chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Unshakable (Ex): </b>Starting at 3rd level, a vigilante adds his class level to the DC of any attempts to Intimidate him.</p>
			<p><b>Vigilante Talent: </b>Starting at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a vigilante talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as possessing another vigilante talent, possessing a particular specialization, or attaining a minimum level. Once a talent has been selected, it can&#146;t be changed.</p>
			<p>If the vigilante uses any of these talents while in his social identity, he must succeed at a Disguise check against the Perception checks of all onlookers (without the +20 circumstance bonus from seamless guise) or the onlookers will realize that he is more than his social identity appears to be and perhaps discover the social and vigilante identities are one and the same. If a talent calls for a saving throw, the DC for that save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s level + the vigilante&#146;s Charisma modifier, unless stated otherwise.</p>
			<p><b>Startling Appearance (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a vigilante learns to use the element of surprise to his advantage, startling foes that are unaware of his presence. Whenever a vigilante with this ability attempts an attack against a foe that is completely unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (usually due to Stealth or invisibility), the foe is treated as flat-footed for the rest of the vigilante&#146;s turn (uncanny dodge or a similar ability prevents this effect unless the vigilante is at least 4 levels higher than the foe with uncanny dodge). The foe also takes a &#150;4 penalty on attacks made against the vigilante until the start of the vigilante&#146;s next turn.</p>
			<p><b>Frightening Appearance (Ex): </b>At 11th level, whenever a vigilante with this ability makes an attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance above), the vigilante can, as a free action, attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of his attack and any enemies within 10 feet who can see the attack. This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one Intimidate check and applies the result to all the targets. If the check succeeds against the target of the vigilante&#146;s attack, that foe is also frightened for 1 round, in addition to being shaken as normal, unless the foe succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier).</p>
			<p>Once a creature has been the target of this ability (either as the target of the attack or as a nearby creature, regardless of whether or not it was successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s frightening appearance for 24 hours. This effect is in addition to the bonuses gained from the startling appearance ability. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Stunning Appearance (Ex) </b>: At 17th level, a vigilante can leave his foes unable to respond when he appears. Whenever a vigilante with this ability makes a successful attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (see startling appearance), the foe must make a successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier) or be stunned until the end of the vigilante&#146;s next turn. If the creature has more HD than the vigilante&#146;s class level, it receives a +4 circumstance bonus on this save. This ability is in addition to the effects of startling appearance and frightening appearance. Once a creature has been the target of this ability (regardless of whether or not the saving throw is successful), it is immune to that vigilante&#146;s stunning appearance for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Vengeance Strike (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante&#146;s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.</p>
