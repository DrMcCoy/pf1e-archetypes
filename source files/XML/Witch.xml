					<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some witches find their patrons while in the throes of despair and grief, when all they desire is to see the veneer of civilization peel back to reveal the filth and rot that underlies all things. The arcane power they inherit is bleak and tainted, eating them from the inside out and transforming them into living avatars of entropy.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Witch's class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p>Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch&#146;s level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>

			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

					<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>

Many pact witches worship specific deities or demigods native to the planes with which they forged their pacts. When a pact witch chooses his plane, his body transforms in minor, cosmetic ways associated with that plane. A pact with Hell might give a pact witch small devil horns, while a pact with the Heaven might cause a pact witch to have a softly glowing golden halo, and a pact with Axis might give a pact witch&#146;s skin strange rune patterns.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Though all witches forge bonds with mysterious powers known as patrons, a pact witch takes this bond to an extreme by forging an inexorable pact with the Outer Planes.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>A pact witch&#146;s alignment must match that of his chosen plane. A pact witch whose alignment no longer matches his bonded plane becomes an ex&#150;pact witch and loses all the benefits of this archetype until he atones for his transgressions. In time, likely after benefitting from an atonement spell, an ex&#150;pact witch can forge a bond with another plane that matches his new alignment.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Witches are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a witch&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list. A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a witch&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;10. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which spells to prepare.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 2&#150;10 under &#147;Spells per Day.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 1st level, a witch gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex at 2nd level and for every 2 levels attained after 2nd level, as noted on Table 2&#150;10. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch&#146;s level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Planar Familiar: </b>When a pact witch reaches 6th level, his familiar turns into an outsider native to his chosen plane. The familiar retains its spells known; its memories; and its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, but is treated as a member of its new race in all other respects. The type of creature the familiar becomes is indicated above on Table; if more than one type of familiar is listed, a pact witch can choose which type his familiar becomes.</p>
			<p><b>Planar Pact (Su): </b>A pact witch chooses one Outer Plane with which to forge a pact. This plane determines the alignment a pact witch must maintain and the type of improved familiar he gains at 6th level. Many pact witches worship specific deities or demigods native to the planes with which they forged their pacts. When a pact witch chooses his plane, his body transforms in minor, cosmetic ways associated with that plane. A pact with Hell might give a pact witch small devil horns, while a pact with the Heaven might cause a pact witch to have a softly glowing golden halo, and a pact with Axis might give a pact witch&#146;s skin strange rune patterns. The nature of this cosmetic change varies from witch to witch, but has no mechanical effect. Instead of learning new spells from a patron, a pact witch learns new spells from his planar pact, starting at 2nd level and again every 2 levels thereafter.</p>
			<p>2nd Level: Protection from chaos/evil/good/law (choose one appropriate to your plane)</p>
			<p>4th Level: Time shudder.</p>
			<p>6th Level: Infuse self.</p>
			<p>8th Level: Lesser planar ally.</p>
			<p>10th Level: Plane shift (as a 5th level spell).</p>
			<p>12th Level: Planar ally.</p>
			<p>14th Level: Banishment.</p>
			<p>16th Level: Greater planar ally.</p>
			<p>18th Level: Gate.</p>
			<p>This replaces patron.</p>
			<p><b>Witch&#146;s Familiar (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
			<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>
			<p><b>Major Hex: </b>Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<p><b>Grand Hex: </b>Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>-</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Witch's class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Witches are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a witch&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list. A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a witch&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;10. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which spells to prepare.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 2&#150;10 under &#147;Spells per Day.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 1st level, a witch gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex at 2nd level and for every 2 levels attained after 2nd level, as noted on Table 2&#150;10. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch&#146;s level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Patron: </b>At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch&#146;s patron adds new spells to a witch&#146;s list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to decide.</p>
			<p><b>Witch&#146;s Familiar (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
			<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>
			<p><b>Major Hex: </b>Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<p><b>Grand Hex: </b>Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

				<name type="string">Wyrmwitch's Hoard</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Unlike traditional witches, a wyrmwitch does not have a familiar. Instead, a wyrmwitch develops a metaphysical link with a bonded hoard of treasure that serves as a conduit to the wyrmwitch&#146;s patron. A wyrmwitch&#146;s hoard must have a value of 50 gp plus 100 gp for every character level he has beyond 1st. Only nonmagical objects that are not alchemical items, weapons, armor, or useful tools can be part of a wyrmwitch&#146;s hoard. If the hoard falls below this value, the wyrmwitch cannot sleep on his hoard (see below) or add new spells to it until its value is restored.</p>
					<p>A wyrmwitch&#146;s spells come from this link with his hoard, and its ability to hold spells functions in a manner identical to the way a witch&#146;s spells are normally granted by a familiar. A wyrmwitch can add spells to his hoard in a similar fashion to the way conventional witches store spells in their familiars. A witch&#146;s familiar and a wyrmwitch&#146;s hoard can exchange spells in the same way two normal witch familiars do. Also, a witch can add a spell to his hoard from a wizard&#146;s spellbook, if the spellbook is kept in the hoard and the spell is on the witch&#146;s class spell list. The wyrmwitch must sleep on the spellbook in his hoard for a number of days equal to the spell&#146;s level, after which he must succeed at a Spellcraft check (DC = 15 + spell level) to learn the spell. No matter the result, the spell is erased from the spellbook.</p>
					<p>A wyrmwitch must commune with his hoard to ready his body and mind for casting spells. If he does not spend at least 8 hours resting atop his hoard prior to preparing spells, he must attempt a concentration check anytime he attempts to cast a spell (DC = 20 + the spell&#146;s level). If the wyrmwitch does prepare spells after properly sleeping on his hoard, he gains the ability to call on his hoard to cast any one spell it is holding and that he is capable of casting, even if the spell is not prepared. This spell is treated like any other spell cast by the wyrmwitch, including when determining casting time, duration, and other effects dependent on the wyrmwitch&#146;s level. This spell cannot be modified by metamagic feats or other abilities.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Though a dragon derives no power from accumulating precious metals and gems, its desire to acquire and maintain vast piles of valuables is an important part of its personality. Some witch covens, particularly those in rich mercantile nations like Druma or Katapesh, have learned to use treasure to access other draconic powers.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Witch's class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Witches are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a witch&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list. A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a witch&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;10. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which spells to prepare.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 2&#150;10 under &#147;Spells per Day.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.</p>
			<p><b>Draconic Patronage : </b>A wyrmwitch must select one of the following patrons when he gains this archetype. Only witches with the wyrmwitch archetype can select these patrons</p>
			<p><i>Chromatic: </i>2nd - cause fear, 4th - hold person, 6th - suggestion, 8th - aura of doomUM, 10th - dominate person, 12th - geas/quest, 14th - mass hold person, 16th - frightful aspectUC, 18th - overwhelming presence</p>
			<p><i>Esoteric: </i>2nd - memory lapseAPG, 4th - psychic readingOA, 6th - nondetection, 8th - hypercognitionOA, 10th - mind probeOA, 12th - telepathy, 14th - insanity, 16th - screen, 18th - bilocationOA</p>
			<p><i>Imperial: </i>2nd - endure elements, 4th - gust of wind, 6th - hyraulic torrentAPG, 8th - obsidian flowUC, 10th - fickle windsUM, 12th - move earth, 14th - reverse gravity, 16th - wall of laveAPG, 18th - world waveAPG</p>
			<p><i>Metallic: </i>2nd - protection from evil, 4th - weapon of aweAPG, 6th - heroism, 8th - dispel evil, 10th - commune, 12th - greater herosim, 14th - limited wish, 16th - holy aura, 18th - miracle</p>
			<p><i>Outer: </i>2nd - deja vuOA, 4th - darkness, 6th - blink, 8th - black tentacles, 10th - mindwipeOA, 12th - shadow walk, 14th - lunar veilUM, 16th - orb of the voidUM, 18th - weird</p>
			<p><i>Primal: </i>2nd - burning hands, 4th - elemental touchAPG, 6th - elemental auraAPG, 8th - planar adaptationAPG, 10th - elemental body II, 12th - chain lightning, 14th - vortexAPG, 16th - polar ray, 18th - fiery bodyAPG</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 1st level, a witch gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex at 2nd level and for every 2 levels attained after 2nd level, as noted on Table 2&#150;10. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch&#146;s level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Wyrmwitch's Hoard : </b>Unlike traditional witches, a wyrmwitch does not have a familiar. Instead, a wyrmwitch develops a metaphysical link with a bonded hoard of treasure that serves as a conduit to the wyrmwitch&#146;s patron. A wyrmwitch&#146;s hoard must have a value of 50 gp plus 100 gp for every character level he has beyond 1st. Only nonmagical objects that are not alchemical items, weapons, armor, or useful tools can be part of a wyrmwitch&#146;s hoard. If the hoard falls below this value, the wyrmwitch cannot sleep on his hoard (see below) or add new spells to it until its value is restored.</p>
			<p>A wyrmwitch&#146;s spells come from this link with his hoard, and its ability to hold spells functions in a manner identical to the way a witch&#146;s spells are normally granted by a familiar. A wyrmwitch can add spells to his hoard in a similar fashion to the way conventional witches store spells in their familiars. A witch&#146;s familiar and a wyrmwitch&#146;s hoard can exchange spells in the same way two normal witch familiars do. Also, a witch can add a spell to his hoard from a wizard&#146;s spellbook, if the spellbook is kept in the hoard and the spell is on the witch&#146;s class spell list. The wyrmwitch must sleep on the spellbook in his hoard for a number of days equal to the spell&#146;s level, after which he must succeed at a Spellcraft check (DC = 15 + spell level) to learn the spell. No matter the result, the spell is erased from the spellbook.</p>
			<p>A wyrmwitch must commune with his hoard to ready his body and mind for casting spells. If he does not spend at least 8 hours resting atop his hoard prior to preparing spells, he must attempt a concentration check anytime he attempts to cast a spell (DC = 20 + the spell&#146;s level). If the wyrmwitch does prepare spells after properly sleeping on his hoard, he gains the ability to call on his hoard to cast any one spell it is holding and that he is capable of casting, even if the spell is not prepared. This spell is treated like any other spell cast by the wyrmwitch, including when determining casting time, duration, and other effects dependent on the wyrmwitch&#146;s level. This spell cannot be modified by metamagic feats or other abilities.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces witch&#146;s familiar.</p>
			<p><b>Major Hex: </b>Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<p><b>Grand Hex: </b>Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

					<p>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
					<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>

					<p>Once per day when preparing her spells, a witch-watcher makes a covenant with her patron to provide protection to a single creature, known as her covenant ally. As a standard action when her covenant ally is within 30 feet, a witch-watcher can grant it one of the abilities listed below. Unless otherwise noted, each ability lasts for a number of minutes equal to the witch-watcher&#146;s Intelligence modifier. She can grant a number of abilities per day equal to 1/2 her witch level (minimum 1).</p>
					<p>Health: The covenant ally gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the witch-watcher&#146;s witch level + her Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). The temporary hit points from this ability do not stack with themselves, but additional uses cause the total number of temporary hit points and the duration to reset.</p>
					<p>Safeguard: The covenant ally gains a deflection bonus to AC or a resistance bonus on saving throws equal to 1/2 the witch-watcher&#146;s witch level (minimum 1). When given, this bonus can be divided between the AC and saving throws as the witch-watcher wishes, up to a maximum of +5 for either.</p>
					<p>Solace: The witch-watcher temporarily disrupts a spell affecting her covenant ally by succeeding at a dispel check against the spell, as per dispel magic. The ability suppresses a spell effect for a number of rounds equal to the witchwatcher&#146;s Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). If the spell affects multiple creatures, this ability suppresses the spell effect only for the covenant ally. At the end of this duration, the spell resumes and the suppressed rounds do not count against its total duration. This ability has no effect on spells that are instantaneous or have a duration of permanent.</p>
					<p>Spell Resistance: The covenant ally gains spell resistance equal to 6 + the witch-watcher&#146;s witch level for a number of rounds equal to the witch-watcher&#146;s Intelligence modifier. At 10th level, the spell resistance increases to 11 + the witch-watcher&#146;s witch level. The spell resistance cannot be suppressed, but it doesn&#146;t affect spells cast by the witch-watcher.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>For reasons known only to them, witch-watchers offer protection to nobles across Golarion. While they serve openly in Irrisen and Varisia, they watch from the shadows in courts in Brevoy, Mendev, the River Kingdoms, and Ustalav, where their presence is barely tolerated.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Witch's class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Witches are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a witch&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list. A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a witch&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;10. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which spells to prepare.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 2&#150;10 under &#147;Spells per Day.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.</p>
			<p><b>Covenant Ally (Su): </b>Once per day when preparing her spells, a witch-watcher makes a covenant with her patron to provide protection to a single creature, known as her covenant ally. As a standard action when her covenant ally is within 30 feet, a witch-watcher can grant it one of the abilities listed below. Unless otherwise noted, each ability lasts for a number of minutes equal to the witch-watcher&#146;s Intelligence modifier. She can grant a number of abilities per day equal to 1/2 her witch level (minimum 1).</p>
			<p><i>Health: </i>The covenant ally gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the witch-watcher&#146;s witch level + her Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). The temporary hit points from this ability do not stack with themselves, but additional uses cause the total number of temporary hit points and the duration to reset.</p>
			<p><i>Safeguard: </i>The covenant ally gains a deflection bonus to AC or a resistance bonus on saving throws equal to 1/2 the witch-watcher&#146;s witch level (minimum 1). When given, this bonus can be divided between the AC and saving throws as the witch-watcher wishes, up to a maximum of +5 for either.</p>
			<p><i>Solace: </i>The witch-watcher temporarily disrupts a spell affecting her covenant ally by succeeding at a dispel check against the spell, as per dispel magic. The ability suppresses a spell effect for a number of rounds equal to the witchwatcher&#146;s Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). If the spell affects multiple creatures, this ability suppresses the spell effect only for the covenant ally. At the end of this duration, the spell resumes and the suppressed rounds do not count against its total duration. This ability has no effect on spells that are instantaneous or have a duration of permanent.</p>
			<p><i>Spell Resistance: </i>The covenant ally gains spell resistance equal to 6 + the witch-watcher&#146;s witch level for a number of rounds equal to the witch-watcher&#146;s Intelligence modifier. At 10th level, the spell resistance increases to 11 + the witch-watcher&#146;s witch level. The spell resistance cannot be suppressed, but it doesn&#146;t affect spells cast by the witch-watcher.</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 1st level, a witch gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex at 2nd level and for every 2 levels attained after 2nd level, as noted on Table 2&#150;10. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch&#146;s level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Diminished Spellcasting: </b>A witch-watcher gains one fewer spell of each level than normal. If this reduces the number to zero, she can cast spells of that level only if her Intelligence score is high enough to grant bonus spells of that level.</p>
			<p><b>Patron: </b>At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch&#146;s patron adds new spells to a witch&#146;s list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to decide.</p>
			<p><b>Witch&#146;s Familiar (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
			<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>
			<p><b>Major Hex: </b>Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<p><b>Grand Hex: </b>Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The descendents of Baba Yaga rule the frozen realm of Irrisen, and possess a unique power stemming from their otherworldly origin and their ties to cold magic. This power is partly magical, partly political, and partly cultural. Known as winter witches, these scions of Baba Yaga have not bothered to hide their secrets from outsiders, for they understand that those who see winter witches not native to Irrisen working their frozen magic will simply assume the witches are agents of Irrisen. By opening up their traditions to those who have no direct blood connection to Baba Yaga or the ruling families of Irrisen, they spread the notoriety and infamy of their wintry magic far beyond what they could accomplish on their own. While winter witches are most commonly encountered in Irrisen, they could be encountered in any part of the Inner Sea region, where they work to increase Irrisen&#146;s notoriety with each frozen spell and manipulative hex they cast. A winter witch has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Witch's class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Witches are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a witch&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list. A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a witch&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;10. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which spells to prepare.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>A winter witch adds ray of frost to her spell list, but does not automatically learn this cantrip.</p>
			<p>Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 2&#150;10 under &#147;Spells per Day.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.</p>
			<p><b>Cold Flesh (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a winter witch gains endure elements as a constant spell-like ability, but only against cold temperatures. At 4th level, she gains cold resistance 5, making her comfortable in near-freezing temperatures. At 9th-level, this increases to cold resistance 10, and at 14th level, it becomes immunity to cold. This replaces the witch&#146;s 4th-level hex.</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 1st level, a witch gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex at 2nd level and for every 2 levels attained after 2nd level, as noted on Table 2&#150;10. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch&#146;s level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Ice Magic: </b>When a winter witch casts a spell with the cold descriptor, the save DC of the spell increases by 1. A winter witch cannot learn or cast spells with the fire descriptor at all.</p>
			<p><b>Patron: </b>A winter witch must choose her patron from one of the following patron themes: ancestors*, deception, enchantment*, endurance, moon*, occult*, portents*, stars*, transformation, trickery, vengeance*, water, winter*, or wisdom. An asterisk (*) indicates that the patron theme is detailed in Ultimate Magic.</p>
			<p><b>Witch&#146;s Familiar (Ex): </b>Winter witches must choose a familiar that is native to the frozen north, even if they themselves operate in other regions. Traditionally, this limits winter witch familiar choices to bat, cat, fox, hawk, owl, rat, raven, or weasel. A winter witch who gains the Improved Familiar feat can select any familiar she desires, save for familiars with the fire subtype.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
			<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>
			<p><b>Major Hex: </b>Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<p><b>Grand Hex: </b>Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a white-haired witch gains the ability to use her hair as a weapon. This functions as a primary natural attack with a reach of 5 feet. The hair deals 1d4 points of damage (1d3 for a Small witch) plus the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier. In addition, whenever the hair strikes a foe, the witch can attempt to grapple that foe with her hair as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity, using her Intelligence modifier in place of her Strength modifier when making the combat maneuver check. When a white-haired witch grapples a foe in this way, she does not gain the grappled condition.</p>
					<p>At 4th level and every four levels thereafter, a whitehaired witch&#146;s hair adds 5 feet to its reach, to a maximum of 30 feet at 20th level.</p>

At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A white-haired witch concentrates her mysterious powers on improving her prowess in melee, using feats of agility and her prehensile hair to deal extreme damage. Rogue talents and advanced rogue talents marked with an asterisk (*) can be found in the Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&#146;s Guide. The white-haired witch is an archetype of the witch class.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Witch's class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Witches are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a witch&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list. A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a witch&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;10. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which spells to prepare.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 2&#150;10 under &#147;Spells per Day.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.</p>
			<p><b>Patron: </b>At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch&#146;s patron adds new spells to a witch&#146;s list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to decide.</p>
			<p><b>White Hair (Su): </b>At 1st level, a white-haired witch gains the ability to use her hair as a weapon. This functions as a primary natural attack with a reach of 5 feet. The hair deals 1d4 points of damage (1d3 for a Small witch) plus the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier. In addition, whenever the hair strikes a foe, the witch can attempt to grapple that foe with her hair as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity, using her Intelligence modifier in place of her Strength modifier when making the combat maneuver check. When a white-haired witch grapples a foe in this way, she does not gain the grappled condition.</p>
			<p>At 4th level and every four levels thereafter, a whitehaired witch&#146;s hair adds 5 feet to its reach, to a maximum of 30 feet at 20th level.</p>
			<p>The hair cannot be sundered or attacked as a separate creature. In addition, a white-haired witch further improves her ability to control her hair as she progresses in level, gaining the following abilities.</p>
			<p><i>Constrict (Ex): </i>At 2nd level, when the white-haired witch&#146;s hair successfully grapples an opponent, it can begin constricting her victim as a free action, dealing damage equal to that of its attack.</p>
			<p><i>Trip (Ex): </i>At 4th level, a white-haired witch who successfully strikes a foe with her hair can attempt a combat maneuver check to trip the creature as a free action.</p>
			<p><i>Pull (Ex): </i>At 6th level, a white-haired witch who successfully strikes a foe with her hair can attempt a combat maneuver check to pull the creature 5 feet closer to her as a free action.</p>
			<p><i>Strangle (Ex): </i>At 8th level, when the white-haired witch&#146;s hair is grappling with an opponent, that creature is considered strangled, and cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces hex.</p>
			<p><b>Witch&#146;s Familiar (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
			<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents: </b>At 10th level, a white-haired witch learns a rogue talent, using her white-haired witch level in place of her rogue level. At 12th level and for every two levels thereafter, she gains an additional rogue talent. A whitehaired witch cannot select an individual rogue talent more than once, and can select from among the following: assault leader*, combat trick, finesse rogue, major magic, minor magic, positioning attack*, resiliency, surprise attack, and weapon training. At 18th level and 20th level, a white-haired witch can choose from among the following advanced rogue talents: another day*, defensive roll, improved evasion, opportunist, redirect attack*, slippery mind, and thoughtful reexamining*. This ability replaces major hex and grand hex.</p>
			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

					<p>Familiars without an appropriate natural attack instead gain the ability to spit the poison as a ranged touch attack. This spit attack deals no damage, but it exposes the struck creature to the poison, forcing it to attempt a saving throw to resist the poison as normal. If the familiar already has a poison, the witch can instead empower its poison. An empowered poison&#146;s frequency increases by 50%. If the witch ever replaces her familiar, she must choose how this ability applies to her new familiar as soon as she receives it.</p>

				<name type="string">Witch&#146;s Familiar</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
					<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Witches are no strangers to poisons, using them alongside their various brews, curses, spells, and other tools of the trade. A number of witches are masters of poison, receiving toxic gifts that allow them and their familiars to use poison in unparalleled manners.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Witch's class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Witches are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a witch&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list. A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a witch&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;10. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which spells to prepare.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 2&#150;10 under &#147;Spells per Day.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.</p>
			<p><b>Patron: </b>At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch&#146;s patron adds new spells to a witch&#146;s list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to decide.</p>
			<p><b>Poisonous Familiar (Ex): </b>The venom siphoner chooses either her familiar&#146;s bite attack or its claw attacks; once chosen, this selection can&#146;t be changed. The chosen natural attack gains the following poison ability: Siphoner Poison: Natural attack&#151;injury; save Fort DC 10 + half the witch&#146;s level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Dex; cure 1 save.</p>
			<p>Familiars without an appropriate natural attack instead gain the ability to spit the poison as a ranged touch attack. This spit attack deals no damage, but it exposes the struck creature to the poison, forcing it to attempt a saving throw to resist the poison as normal. If the familiar already has a poison, the witch can instead empower its poison. An empowered poison&#146;s frequency increases by 50%. If the witch ever replaces her familiar, she must choose how this ability applies to her new familiar as soon as she receives it.</p>
			<p>This replaces the hex gained at 1st level and the familiar&#146;s alertness special ability.</p>
			<p><b>Witch&#146;s Familiar (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
			<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>
			<p><b>Venom Expert (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a venom siphoner does not risk exposure to her familiar&#146;s poison when attempting to milk venom from it (see page 142 of Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Wilderness). This replaces the hex gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 1st level, a witch gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex at 6th level and for every 2 levels attained after 2nd level, as noted on Table 2&#150;10. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch&#146;s level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Toxic Blood (Ex): </b>At 6th level, the venom siphoner&#146;s blood becomes toxic, empowering her abilities. Any creature that deals bleed damage to her with a natural, light, or one-handed weapon is automatically exposed to the same poison granted to her familiar and must succeed at the save or be affected by the poison. Additionally, when casting spells that have a single target and require a Fortitude save, she can cause the spell to deliver this poison as a free action; a target who succeeds at the save against the spell also avoids being affected by the poison. She can cause spells to deliver poison in this way a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Intelligence modifier. This ability refreshes when the venom siphoner communes with her familiar to prepare her daily spells. This replaces the hex gained at 6th level.</p>
			<p><b>Major Hex: </b>Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<p><b>Grand Hex: </b>Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Veneficus witches specialize in poisons&#151;brewing both magical and traditional concoctions, and applying them to weapons, traps or even her potent hexes. Whether they&#146;re members of Daggermark&#146;s Poisoners&#146; Guild or followers of Gyronna, veneficus witches are commonly found in the River Kingdoms.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Witch's class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><i>Hexes: </i><b>Concentrate poison, poison conversion (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 24), sticky poison.</b></p>
			<p><i>Major Hexes: </i>Malignant poison (Pathfinder Player Companion: Dungeoneer&#146;s Handbook 27), nauseating flesh (Ultimate Combat 24).</p>
			<p><i>Grand Hexes: </i>Poison touch (grand discovery).</p>
			<p><b>Witch&#146;s Familiar (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
			<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>
			<p><b>Poison Use (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a veneficus witch cannot accidentally poison herself when applying poison to a weapon.</p>
			<p><b>Toxic Words (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, whenever a veneficus witch targets a single creature with a hex, she can imbue her hex with a dose of injury or contact poison she is holding. The DCs of her hex and the poison are each reduced by 2; if the creature fails its save against the hex, the poison is expended and the creature must succeed at a Fortitude save against the poison or become poisoned. At 10th level, the DC of the witch&#146;s hex and poison are each reduced by only 1 and the witch can imbue her hexes with inhaled and ingested poisons as well. This ability replaces the witch&#146;s 2nd- and 10th-level hexes.</p>
			<p><b>Major Hex: </b>Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<p><b>Grand Hex: </b>Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

					<p>At 2nd level, a vellemancer learns to invest magical aid into a willing creature. Each day, she can implant a number of hexes equal to half her witch level (minimum 1) plus her Intelligence bonus (if any). Any given creature can have only one hex implanted at a given time, and implanting a new hex ends the previous one (the witch still loses the use of this ability she spent on the previous hex). Only beneficial hexes capable of affecting another creature can be implanted with invested hex, and this counts against the uses per day of hexes with limited uses per day or per creature.</p>
					<p>To implant a hex, the vellemancer must take a standard action and touch a willing creature. The vellemancer can activate the hex as a free action, or the hex can activate automatically when a single predetermined condition is met (decided when the hex is implanted). The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the witch to trigger the hex, but a predetermined condition can activate the hex regardless of range. An implanted hex lasts until the next time the witch regains her spells. Once triggered, a hex is no longer implanted and can&#146;t be triggered again.</p>

					<p>Beginning at 6th level, a vellemancer can borrow mental strength from others&#146; hopes and dreams to empower her own spellcasting. A creature can make a wish as a free action at any time, even during the vellemancer&#146;s turn. The vellemancer must be able to hear and understand a wish in order to use it as a spell component. A spell that doesn&#146;t normally have a verbal component gains one when cast using this ability. A wish doesn&#146;t need to mention the name of a specific spell, but it must describe an outcome that can be accomplished by casting a spell the vellemancer knows (for example, wishing to be more likable could supply the verbal component for alter self, eagle&#146;s splendor, or even baleful polymorph, depending on the results). A vellemancer gains a +1 bonus to her caster level when using a creature&#146;s wish as a verbal component in this manner, but she cannot include herself as a target of such spells. She can be affected by such a spell if it affects an area rather than one or more targets. A vellemancer is under no compulsion to grant a creature&#146;s wish. Once the vellemancer grants a creature&#146;s wish using this ability, she cannot use this ability to grant that creature any further wishes for 24 hours.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>While the popular stereotype envisions witches as wicked spellcasters sowing misery, many people turn to the arcane to heal others and better the world. The vellemancer is a guide, using her witchcraft to empower and teach others. She rarely dispenses every gift a needy soul asks, but she instead offers the advice, opportunities, and tools people require to achieve their own dreams.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Witch's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Int), Fly (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Witches are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a witch&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list. A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a witch&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;10. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which spells to prepare.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 2&#150;10 under &#147;Spells per Day.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 1st level, a witch gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex at 2nd level and for every 2 levels attained after 2nd level, as noted on Table 2&#150;10. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch&#146;s level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Keen Counselor: </b>The vellemancer is a guide and counselor. She adds Diplomacy and Sense Motive to her list of class skills. If a vellemancer&#146;s alignment becomes evil, she loses access to all the unique abilities provided by this archetype.</p>
			<p><b>Patron: </b>At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch&#146;s patron adds new spells to a witch&#146;s list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to decide.</p>
			<p><b>Witch&#146;s Familiar (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
			<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>
			<p><b>Invested Hex (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a vellemancer learns to invest magical aid into a willing creature. Each day, she can implant a number of hexes equal to half her witch level (minimum 1) plus her Intelligence bonus (if any). Any given creature can have only one hex implanted at a given time, and implanting a new hex ends the previous one (the witch still loses the use of this ability she spent on the previous hex). Only beneficial hexes capable of affecting another creature can be implanted with invested hex, and this counts against the uses per day of hexes with limited uses per day or per creature.</p>
			<p>To implant a hex, the vellemancer must take a standard action and touch a willing creature. The vellemancer can activate the hex as a free action, or the hex can activate automatically when a single predetermined condition is met (decided when the hex is implanted). The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the witch to trigger the hex, but a predetermined condition can activate the hex regardless of range. An implanted hex lasts until the next time the witch regains her spells. Once triggered, a hex is no longer implanted and can&#146;t be triggered again.</p>
			<p>This replaces the hex normally gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Wishgranter (Su): </b>Beginning at 6th level, a vellemancer can borrow mental strength from others&#146; hopes and dreams to empower her own spellcasting. A creature can make a wish as a free action at any time, even during the vellemancer&#146;s turn. The vellemancer must be able to hear and understand a wish in order to use it as a spell component. A spell that doesn&#146;t normally have a verbal component gains one when cast using this ability. A wish doesn&#146;t need to mention the name of a specific spell, but it must describe an outcome that can be accomplished by casting a spell the vellemancer knows (for example, wishing to be more likable could supply the verbal component for alter self, eagle&#146;s splendor, or even baleful polymorph, depending on the results). A vellemancer gains a +1 bonus to her caster level when using a creature&#146;s wish as a verbal component in this manner, but she cannot include herself as a target of such spells. She can be affected by such a spell if it affects an area rather than one or more targets. A vellemancer is under no compulsion to grant a creature&#146;s wish. Once the vellemancer grants a creature&#146;s wish using this ability, she cannot use this ability to grant that creature any further wishes for 24 hours.</p>
			<p>This replaces the hex gained at 6th level.</p>
			<p><b>Expanded Wishgranter (Su): </b>At 8th level, the vellemancer adds the following spells to her familiar for free: bear&#146;s endurance, bull&#146;s strength, cat&#146;s grace, eagle&#146;s splendor, fox&#146;s cunning, and owl&#146;s wisdom. The vellemancer can cast these spells only as part of her wishgranter ability, but she can sacrifice any prepared spell of 2nd level or lower to spontaneously cast one of these spells.</p>
			<p>This replaces the hex normally gained at 8th level.</p>
			<p><b>Major Hex: </b>Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<p><b>Grand Hex: </b>Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

The target can end the effect with a successful Strength check (DC = 15 + 1/2 the tatterdemalion&#146;s witch level) as a standard action, or by slashing the stitches with a magic slashing weapon as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Either way, the victim takes 1d4 points of bleed damage and either is dazzled (for stitched eyes) or takes a &#150;2 penalty on bite attack and damage rolls and a 20% chance of spell failure with verbal components (for a stitched mouth). Either residual effect lasts 1 minute per witch level. Any creature can safely remove the enchanted threads with a minute of work and a successful DC 25 Heal check.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some witches can bend the warp and weft of fabric and thread.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Witch's class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Witches are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a witch&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail. A tatterdemalion is proficient with bolas, nets, and whips.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list. A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a witch&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;10. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which spells to prepare.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>A tatterdemalion must choose mage hand, open/ close, and prestidigitation as her prepared cantrips at 1st level, and they require a piece of cloth, string, rope, or other woven material (including clothing) as a focus. Any action she takes with these cantrips must involve the focus. Starting at 2nd level, she can choose any cantrip for her remaining cantrip.</p>
			<p>Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 2&#150;10 under &#147;Spells per Day.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.</p>
			<p><b>Dancing Strings (Su): </b>A tatterdemalion adds animate rope to her class spell list and spells her familiar knows. She can control her clothing and cloth, rope, or woven fabric she wears in a manner otherwise identical to the prehensile hairUM hex.</p>
			<p>This alters spells and replaces the hex gained at 1st level.</p>
			<p><b>Patron: </b>At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch&#146;s patron adds new spells to a witch&#146;s list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to decide.</p>
			<p><b>Witch&#146;s Familiar (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
			<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 1st level, a witch gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex at 2nd level and for every 2 levels attained after 2nd level, as noted on Table 2&#150;10. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch&#146;s level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Witchweaver: </b>A tatterdemalion gains the following unique hexes, with a caster level equal to her witch level.</p>
			<p><i>Moth-Eaten (Sp): </i>At 4th level, a tatterdemalion can make a touch attack that damages leather, rope, or cloth like rusting grasp damages metal, once per day per witch level.</p>
			<p><i>Lace Weaver (Sp): </i>At 8th level, a tatterdemalion can create cloth as per minor creation or create one 5-foot cube of tangled skeins of cloth per witch level, affecting the target areas as per web, once per day for every 4 witch levels she has.</p>
			<p><i>Sinister Stitching (Su)&#60;: </i>At 12th level, once per day for every 4 witch levels she has, a tatterdemalion can conjure enchanted threads to hinder a creature she can see (Fortitude negates). The tatterdemalion can choose to either sew shut the target&#146;s eyes (blinding it) or mouth (preventing speech, bite attacks, breath weapons, verbal components, command words, and the like). The target can end the effect with a successful Strength check (DC = 15 + 1/2 the tatterdemalion&#146;s witch level) as a standard action, or by slashing the stitches with a magic slashing weapon as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Either way, the victim takes 1d4 points of bleed damage and either is dazzled (for stitched eyes) or takes a &#150;2 penalty on bite attack and damage rolls and a 20% chance of spell failure with verbal components (for a stitched mouth). Either residual effect lasts 1 minute per witch level. Any creature can safely remove the enchanted threads with a minute of work and a successful DC 25 Heal check.</p>
			<p><i>Unravel (Su): </i>At 16th level, once per day when a tatterdemalion is hit by a melee or ranged attack, she can unravel herself as an immediate action, causing her body and gear to appear to collapse into a bundle of tattered rags and strands while she teleports to any open square within 30 feet. She takes no damage from the triggering attack, but she must have line of effect to the target square. She can use this ability twice per day at 20th level.</p>
			<p>These replace the hexes gained at 4th, 8th, 12th, and 16th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Major Hex: </b>Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<p><b>Grand Hex: </b>Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

				<name type="string">Symbiosis</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a synergist gains the ability to meld or unmeld with her familiar as a standard action. While the familiar is melded, its body becomes part of the synergist&#146;s and can&#146;t be targeted or affected by any means (including ongoing effects), though the familiar can still communicate its feelings empathically. The symbiosis causes the synergist to adopt some basic physical features of the familiar and grants additional abilities based on the synergist&#146;s level.</p>
					<p>At 1st level, during symbiosis the synergist gains darkvision or low-light vision if the familiar possesses it.</p>
					<p>At 5th level, during symbiosis the synergist gains any abilities the familiar possesses that are listed under beast shape I, except flight.</p>
					<p>At 8th level, during symbiosis the synergist gains any abilities the familiar possesses that are listed under beast shape II. If the familiar can fly, the synergist can fly for a total of 1 minute per witch level she possesses per day while in symbiosis. This duration need not be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute intervals.</p>
					<p>Additionally, during symbiosis the synergist gains a single natural attack of a type possessed by its familiar. The attack deals 1d6 points of damage if a primary attack (1d6 for Small synergists) and 1d4 points of damage if a secondary attack (1d3 for Small synergists).</p>
					<p>At 11th level, during symbiosis the synergist gains any abilities the familiar possesses that are listed under beast shape III. If the familiar can fly, the synergist can fly for an unlimited amount of time each day while in symbiosis.</p>
					<p>At 14th level, during symbiosis the synergist gains any abilities the familiar possesses that are listed under beast shape IV. If the familiar has multiple natural attacks, the synergist gains them all, rather than just one.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Synergists gain the ability to combine their forms with their familiars&#146; in order to create something more powerful than either alone.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Witches are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a witch&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list. A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a witch&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;10. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which spells to prepare.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 2&#150;10 under &#147;Spells per Day.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.</p>
			<p><b>Patron: </b>At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch&#146;s patron adds new spells to a witch&#146;s list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to decide.</p>
			<p><b>Symbiosis (Su): </b>At 1st level, a synergist gains the ability to meld or unmeld with her familiar as a standard action. While the familiar is melded, its body becomes part of the synergist&#146;s and can&#146;t be targeted or affected by any means (including ongoing effects), though the familiar can still communicate its feelings empathically. The symbiosis causes the synergist to adopt some basic physical features of the familiar and grants additional abilities based on the synergist&#146;s level.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, during symbiosis the synergist gains darkvision or low-light vision if the familiar possesses it.</p>
			<p>At 5th level, during symbiosis the synergist gains any abilities the familiar possesses that are listed under beast shape I, except flight.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, during symbiosis the synergist gains any abilities the familiar possesses that are listed under beast shape II. If the familiar can fly, the synergist can fly for a total of 1 minute per witch level she possesses per day while in symbiosis. This duration need not be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute intervals.</p>
			<p>Additionally, during symbiosis the synergist gains a single natural attack of a type possessed by its familiar. The attack deals 1d6 points of damage if a primary attack (1d6 for Small synergists) and 1d4 points of damage if a secondary attack (1d3 for Small synergists).</p>
			<p>At 11th level, during symbiosis the synergist gains any abilities the familiar possesses that are listed under beast shape III. If the familiar can fly, the synergist can fly for an unlimited amount of time each day while in symbiosis.</p>
			<p>At 14th level, during symbiosis the synergist gains any abilities the familiar possesses that are listed under beast shape IV. If the familiar has multiple natural attacks, the synergist gains them all, rather than just one.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the hexes gained at 1st, 8th, and 14th level.</p>
			<p><b>Witch&#146;s Familiar (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
			<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 1st level, a witch gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex at 2nd level and for every 2 levels attained after 2nd level, as noted on Table 2&#150;10. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch&#146;s level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Major Hex: </b>Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<p><b>Grand Hex: </b>Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>These charismatic witches, often devotees of the Green Mother, rely on their otherworldly charms to achieve their aims. A seducer focuses on enchantments, turning enemies into friends and friends into toys for her amusement.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Witch's class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Witches are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a witch&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list. A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a witch&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;10. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which spells to prepare.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 2&#150;10 under &#147;Spells per Day.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.</p>
			<p><b>Fey Charm (Su): </b>A seducer gains the charm hex at 1st level. The save DC of this hex is increased by 1. If the target is (or could be) sexually attracted to the seducer, the save DC is instead increased by 2. If she and the target have had willing sexual relations in the past 24 hours, the save DC is instead increased by 3.</p>
			<p>This ability alters the hex gained at 1st level.</p>
			<p><b>Otherworldly Allure: </b>A seducer&#146;s power comes from her allure. She uses her Charisma rather than her Intelligence score for the purpose of all class features and effects related to her witch class, such as bonus spells per day, the maximum spell level she can cast, and save DCs of her spells and hexes.</p>
			<p><b>Patron: </b>A seducer must select deception, enchantmentUM, plant (Pathfinder Player Companion Heroes of the Wild 11), thorns (Heroes of the Wild 13), or trickery as her patron.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch&#146;s patron adds new spells to a witch&#146;s list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to decide.</p>
			<p><b>Witch&#146;s Familiar (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
			<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 1st level, a witch gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex at 2nd level and for every 2 levels attained after 2nd level, as noted on Table 2&#150;10. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch&#146;s level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Seducer&#146;s Kiss (Su): </b>At 6th level, a seducer can kiss another creature as a melee touch attack. The target must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + half the seducer&#146;s level + her Charisma modifier) or be staggered for 1 round. If the target is (or could be) sexually attracted to the seducer, the save DC is increased by 2. If the seducer and the target have had willing sexual relations in the past 24 hours, the save DC is instead increased by 4. Whether or not the creature succeeds at this save, it cannot be the target of this ability again for 1 day. At 10th level, this ability causes the target to become stunned for 1 round, then staggered for an additional round. This is a mind-affecting charm effect.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the hex gained at 6th level.</p>
			<p><b>Garden of Delight (Su): </b>At 8th level, the seducer can create a magical bower once per day. This functions as tiny hut with a caster level equal to the seducer&#146;s witch level, but the interior is a lush garden. Those who rest for 8 hours within the garden heal at twice the usual rate. In addition, any creature engaging in willing sexual relations with the seducer in this garden gains a +2 morale bonus on saving throws for the next 24 hours. This bonus does not apply on saving throws against the seducer&#146;s spells or abilities.</p>
			<p>This replaces the hex gained at 8th level.</p>
			<p><b>Major Hex: </b>Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<p><b>Grand Hex: </b>Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Season witches gain their power from the cyclical and mystical exchange of energy passed from one season of nature to another. Often, season witches carry bitter grudges against their fellow witches, with many believing that the season prior to their chosen focus is inferior and the season that replaces their favored time is an usurper of time, but at other times season witches work together, understanding that all are a part of the cycle of the natural world.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Witch's class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Witches are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a witch&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list. A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a witch&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;10. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which spells to prepare.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 2&#150;10 under &#147;Spells per Day.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 1st level, a witch gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex at 2nd level and for every 2 levels attained after 2nd level, as noted on Table 2&#150;10. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch&#146;s level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Patron: </b>At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch&#146;s patron adds new spells to a witch&#146;s list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to decide.</p>
			<p><b>Season of the Witch (Su): </b>A season witch observes the cycles of life through symbolic festivals and the very real passage of time. Their covens celebrate the seasons and their impact on magic. These seasonal cycles alter their magic and mind-set, focusing their spells and hexes on a predominant energy type and philosophy.</p>
			<p>A season witch makes a commitment to embody the sacred symbolism of a season year round, and learns her spells through communion with nature, divining secrets from shapes in the clouds or the play of leaves on the wind. At 1st level, a season witch chooses the season that defines her abilities as her patron; this choice also provides her certain benefits.</p>
			<p>A spring witch has dominion over the renewing spirit of life and youth. The save DCs of her spells that deal electricity damage increase by 1. At 1st level, she gains either the charm hex or disguise hex as a bonus hex.</p>
			<p>A summer witch has dominion over growth, the harvest, and toil. The save DCs of her spells that deal fire damage increase by 1. At 1st level, she gains either the fortune hex or misfortune hex as a bonus hex.</p>
			<p>An autumn witch has dominion over the provision of the land and the passing of life. The save DCs of her spells that deal acid damage increase by 1. At 1st level, she gains either the blight hex or slumber hex as a bonus hex.</p>
			<p>A winter witch has dominion over hearth and home. The save DCs of her spells that deal cold damage increase by 1. At 1st level, she gains either the healing hex or ward hex as a bonus hex.</p>
			<p><b>Witch&#146;s Familiar (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
			<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>
			<p><b>Major Hex: </b>Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<p><b>Grand Hex: </b>Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

				<name type="string">Witch&#146;s Familiar</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
					<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A sea witch&#146;s affinities are tied to the vast oceans and the rolling waves. Her magic concerns the moon, tides, water, and winds, and she is most at peace when she is upon or near the sea.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Witch's class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Witches are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a witch&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A sea witch replaces some of her patron spells with the following: 2nd&#151;touch of sea, 4th&#151;gust of wind, 6th&#151;water breathing, 8th&#151;control water, 10th&#151;cloudkill, 12th&#151;control wind, 14th&#151;control weather, 16th&#151;vortex, 18th&#151;tsunami.</p>
			<p>A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list. A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a witch&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;10. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which spells to prepare.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 2&#150;10 under &#147;Spells per Day.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 1st level, a witch gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex at 2nd level and for every 2 levels attained after 2nd level, as noted on Table 2&#150;10. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch&#146;s level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Know Direction (Sp): </b>So long as she near a sizable body of water (at least a lake with a diameter of 1 mile or more), a sea witch may cast know direction at will as a spell-like ability.</p>
			<p><b>Patron: </b>A sea witch cannot choose a patron whose interests or theme opposes that of water (for example, earth or fire).</p>
			<p>At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch&#146;s patron adds new spells to a witch&#146;s list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to decide.</p>
			<p><b>Sea Creature Empathy (Ex): </b>A sea witch can influence the attitude of water-dwelling animals and animals that live along coasts and shores, including birds, as if using wild empathy. The sea witch uses her witch level as her druid level for this ability. If the sea witch has wild empathy from another class, her witch levels stack with the other class&#146;s levels to determine her wild empathy bonus for these kinds of creatures. This ability replaces the witch&#146;s 1st-level hex.</p>
			<p><b>Witch&#146;s Familiar (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
			<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>
			<p><b>Major Hex: </b>Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<p><b>Grand Hex: </b>Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

Her fetish mask acts in all ways like a witch&#146;s familiar for the purpose of preparing and gaining spells. Rather than communing with a familiar to prepare spells each day, a scarred witch doctor hangs her mask on a wall, tree branch, or something similar and contemplates the agony it represents.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The scarred witch doctor draws power from her ability to endure pain and suffering. She mutilates her own flesh, inflicting horrific scars, in order to attract the attention of her patron. Rather than call forth a familiar, she creates a repulsive fetish mask that she uses as a repository for her power. A scarred witch doctor has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Race: </b>Orc Only</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Witch's class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Witches are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a witch&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list. A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a witch&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;10. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which spells to prepare.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 2&#150;10 under &#147;Spells per Day.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.</p>
			<p><b>Fetish Mask (Su): </b>At 1st level, a scarred witch doctor forms a bond with a wooden mask. As she gains power, her connection to this mask causes it to grow ever more hideous and grotesque as it absorbs the weight of the self-induced pain that underlies her magic. Her spells derive from the insights her patron grants her while she&#146;s enduring the cuts, burns, and other sorts of mutilations she inflicts upon herself. Her fetish mask acts in all ways like a witch&#146;s familiar for the purpose of preparing and gaining spells. Rather than communing with a familiar to prepare spells each day, a scarred witch doctor hangs her mask on a wall, tree branch, or something similar and contemplates the agony it represents.</p>

If the mask is destroyed, the witch doctor can create another fetish mask (which almost immediately adopts the shocking appearance of the original) for the same price and time it takes a witch to replace a dead familiar.</p>
			<p>At 5th level, the scarred witch doctor gains the ability to add magical abilities to her mask as if she had the Craft Wondrous Item feat.</p>
			<p>This ability otherwise functions like and replaces the standard witch familiar.</p>
			<p><b>Fierce Intelligence: </b>A scarred witch doctor treats her Intelligence score as 2 points higher when determining the highest level of spells she can cast, the number of spells she can cast per day, her spell save DCs, her number of spells known at 1st level, and any effects of her hexes determined by her Intelligence.</p>

			<p><b>Scarshield (Su): </b>At 1st level, a scarred witch doctor learns how to harden her mutilated skin, gaining an enhancement bonus to her natural armor bonus equal to 1/2 her class level (minimum +1). She can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her class level. These minutes do not need to be consecutive but she must spend them in 1-minute increments. This ability replaces the witch&#146;s 1st-level hex.</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 1st level, a witch gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex at 2nd level and for every 2 levels attained after 2nd level, as noted on Table 2&#150;10. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch&#146;s level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Major Hex: </b>Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<p><b>Grand Hex: </b>Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

The target of the opponent&#146;s Diplomacy check must be able to see and hear the rhetorician. If the rhetorician&#146;s Diplomacy check is successful, the opponent&#146;s Diplomacy check fails.

					<p>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
					<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Rhetoricians feel driven to engage in debate, learn as much as they can about their potential foes, and seek ways to use information and quick talking to handle problems before resorting to raw violence. Regardless of their shadowy patrons, rhetoricians are granted a series of spells through their familiars that boost their ability to outtalk and outthink their foes, leading some to believe they are destined to be emissaries for their patrons once some long-term plans of their patrons&#146; come to fruition.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Witch's class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Witches are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a witch&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list. A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a witch&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;10. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which spells to prepare.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 2&#150;10 under &#147;Spells per Day.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.</p>
			<p><b>Debater (Ex): </b>A rhetorician is an expert at making counterarguments and treating everything as a debate. When an opponent attempts a Diplomacy check to change another target&#146;s attitude or request aid, the rhetorician can attempt to make a counterargument to negate the opponent&#146;s efforts. The rhetorician attempts a Diplomacy check as an immediate action, with a DC equal to the result of the opponent&#146;s Diplomacy check. The target of the opponent&#146;s Diplomacy check must be able to see and hear the rhetorician. If the rhetorician&#146;s Diplomacy check is successful, the opponent&#146;s Diplomacy check fails. This ability replaces the hex gained at 1st level.</p>
			<p><b>Patron: </b>At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch&#146;s patron adds new spells to a witch&#146;s list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to decide.</p>
			<p><b>Public Speaker (Ex): </b>A rhetorician gains Perform as a class skill. In addition, she is trained to project her voice with great skill and effect; the DC to hear her speak in difficult conditions is reduced by an amount equal to her class level + her Intelligence modifier (minimum 0).</p>
			<p><b>Witch&#146;s Familiar (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
			<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>
			<p><b>Eldritch Glibness: </b>At 2nd level and every two witch levels thereafter, a rhetorician gains the following spells as spells known at the spell levels listed in parentheses. These spells are automatically added to the list of spells stored by her familiar. She treats these as being on the witch class spell list: 2nd&#151;confusion, lesser (1st), 4th&#151;detect thoughts (2nd), 6th&#151;glibness (3rd), 8th&#151;sculpt sound (4th), 10th&#151;modify memory (5th), 12th&#151;symbol of persuasion (6th), 14th&#151;song of discord (7th), 16th&#151;greater shout (8th), 18th&#151; weird (9th). This ability replaces all the spells the witch gains from her patron.</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 1st level, a witch gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex at 2nd level and for every 2 levels attained after 2nd level, as noted on Table 2&#150;10. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch&#146;s level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Major Hex: </b>Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<p><b>Grand Hex: </b>Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Among that nation&#146;s highly competitive arcane communities, Nexian spellspies are witches who use their familiars and divining talents to spy on their rivals and protect themselves from similar intrusions.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Witch's class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Witches are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a witch&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list. A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a witch&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;10. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which spells to prepare.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 2&#150;10 under &#147;Spells per Day.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 1st level, a witch gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex at 2nd level and for every 2 levels attained after 2nd level, as noted on Table 2&#150;10. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch&#146;s level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Nondetection: </b>A Nexian spellspy treats nondetection as a 4th-level witch spell.</p>
			<p><b>Patron: </b>At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch&#146;s patron adds new spells to a witch&#146;s list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to decide.</p>
			<p><b>Witch&#146;s Familiar (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
			<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>
			<p><b>Infiltrating Vessel (Su): </b>At 3rd-level, a Nexian spellspy cannot use her familiar to deliver touch spells for her. Instead, the Nexian spellspy can cast divination spells through her familiar. When the Nexian spellspy does this, she casts the spell as normal, but she treats her familiar&#146;s location as hers for purpose of determining the spell&#146;s area of effect or range. The Nexian spellspy receives the spell&#146;s results as normal. This ability does not allow her to see through her familiar&#146;s eyes; for example, the Nexian spellspy would know about a powerful magic item detected through her familiar, but she would not know its exact location or exactly what the item looked like. Whenever a familiar would be able to deliver a hex, the Nexian spellspy can use the familiar as a vessel for her divinations in this way.</p>
			<p>This alters the witch&#146;s familiar.</p>
			<p><b>Prepare Results (Su): </b>At 4th level, a Nexian spellspy&#146;s familiar can store the results of divinations for the purposes of providing false results to a rival diviner who has targeted the spellspy. As a standard action, the spellspy can store the results of one or more divinations she has cast within the past 24 hours. She can store results from any number of spells with a total spell level equal to the highest spell she can cast.</p>
			<p>The next time a rival spellcaster would receive results from any of the specific divinations whose results are stored in her familiar in this manner, the stored results are transmitted to the rival caster (and are removed from the familiar) in place of any real results.</p>
			<p>The rival spellcaster receives a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the Nexian spellspy&#146;s witch level + her Intelligence modifier) to recognize that the results are falsified. Depending on the spell, the stored results from the familiar might make this falsification obvious (and thus no Will saving throw is necessary to determine the falsification).</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the witch&#146;s 4th-level hex.</p>
			<p><b>Major Hex: </b>Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<p><b>Grand Hex: </b>Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Mountains can be sanctuaries for witches hunted by society. Here they form bonds with the spirits of the lofty reaches.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Witches are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a witch&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list. A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a witch&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;10. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which spells to prepare.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 2&#150;10 under &#147;Spells per Day.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 1st level, a witch gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex at 2nd level and for every 2 levels attained after 2nd level, as noted on Table 2&#150;10. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch&#146;s level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Patron: </b>A mountain witch replaces some of her patron spells with the following: 2nd&#151;magic stone, 4th&#151;stone callAPG, 6th&#151; meld into stone, 8th&#151;stoneskin, 10th&#151;wall of stone, 12th&#151;stone tell, 14th&#151;statue, 16th&#151;repel metal or stone, 18th&#151;clashing rocksAPG.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch&#146;s patron adds new spells to a witch&#146;s list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to decide.</p>
			<p><b>Stone Spirit Hex: </b>A mountain witch can select hexes from the shaman&#146;s stone spirit (see page 44) as if they were witch hexes. She uses her witch level as her shaman level to determine the effect of the hex, and Intelligence instead of Wisdom to determine its DC. This ability alters hex.</p>
			<p><b>Witch&#146;s Familiar (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
			<p><b>Mountain Beast Empathy (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a mountain witch can influence the attitude of mountain-dwelling animals, as the druid&#146;s wild empathy class feature but only on animals native to mountainous environments. The mountain witch uses her witch level as her druid level for this ability. This ability replaces the hex gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>
			<p><b>Major Hex: </b>Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<p><b>Grand Hex: </b>Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

				<name type="string">Patron Mirror</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a mirror witch creates a direct link to the power of her patron. She chooses a patron as normal, but instead of gaining a familiar that serves as the conduit to her patron, she uses a mirror (worth at least 10 gp) to speak to a fragment of her patron&#146;s power. This fragment teaches her magic and acts as a counselor.</p>
					<p>The mirror is essentially an immobile familiar. The mirror witch can activate it with a minute-long ritual that calls the patron fragment to manifest itself through the mirror. While this connection is open, she can prepare spells, add new spells to the mirror, and use the mirror&#146;s special abilities. In place of the boost granted by an ordinary familiar, the mirror grants the mirror witch a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks regardless of whether the mirror is nearby. The mirror can&#146;t be used for abilities that require the presence of a familiar, such as the blight hex.</p>
					<p>If the patron mirror is destroyed, the mirror witch can replace it 1 day later through a special ritual, attuning a new mirror to a different fragment of her patron. The mirror witch must purchase or procure a new, suitable mirror and spend 500 gp per witch level she has. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete, and when it is finished, the mirror witch establishes a connection with a new fragment of her patron and loses access to spells stored in the previous mirror, as normal for a lost witch&#146;s familiar.</p>
					<p>As the mirror witch progresses in level, the mirror&#146;s defenses increase, and the connection between it and the mirror witch becomes stronger, allowing the patron to manifest more of its personality&#151;see the Patron Mirror section below.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>After being locked away and denied her former familiar, the queen learned to talk to her patron via mirror magic.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Witch's class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Witches are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a witch&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list. A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a witch&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;10. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which spells to prepare.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 2&#150;10 under &#147;Spells per Day.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 1st level, a witch gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex at 2nd level and for every 2 levels attained after 2nd level, as noted on Table 2&#150;10. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch&#146;s level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Patron: </b>At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch&#146;s patron adds new spells to a witch&#146;s list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to decide.</p>
			<p><b>Patron Mirror (Su): </b>At 1st level, a mirror witch creates a direct link to the power of her patron. She chooses a patron as normal, but instead of gaining a familiar that serves as the conduit to her patron, she uses a mirror (worth at least 10 gp) to speak to a fragment of her patron&#146;s power. This fragment teaches her magic and acts as a counselor.</p>
			<p>The mirror is essentially an immobile familiar. The mirror witch can activate it with a minute-long ritual that calls the patron fragment to manifest itself through the mirror. While this connection is open, she can prepare spells, add new spells to the mirror, and use the mirror&#146;s special abilities. In place of the boost granted by an ordinary familiar, the mirror grants the mirror witch a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks regardless of whether the mirror is nearby. The mirror can&#146;t be used for abilities that require the presence of a familiar, such as the blight hex.</p>
			<p>If the patron mirror is destroyed, the mirror witch can replace it 1 day later through a special ritual, attuning a new mirror to a different fragment of her patron. The mirror witch must purchase or procure a new, suitable mirror and spend 500 gp per witch level she has. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete, and when it is finished, the mirror witch establishes a connection with a new fragment of her patron and loses access to spells stored in the previous mirror, as normal for a lost witch&#146;s familiar.</p>
			<p>As the mirror witch progresses in level, the mirror&#146;s defenses increase, and the connection between it and the mirror witch becomes stronger, allowing the patron to manifest more of its personality&#151;see the Patron Mirror section below.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the witch&#146;s familiar.</p>
			<p><b>Major Hex: </b>Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<p><b>Grand Hex: </b>Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<h>Patron Mirror</h>

			<p><b>Hardness: </b>As the connection between the witch and her patron mirror becomes more powerful, so does the hardness of the mirror, making it more difficult to damage. This value is the hardness of the patron mirror.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Points: </b>The base hit points of a mirror witch&#146;s patron mirror are based on what kind of mirror she chooses. A steel mirror has 4 hit points and a glass mirror has 1 hit point. The patron mirror gains the listed hit points in addition to the mirror&#146;s normal hit points, and the hit points increase as the link between the witch and her patron mirror strengthens.</p>
			<p><b>Intelligence: </b>A patron is a powerful and unknowable entity, able to see great distances and offer sage council, but the power of the fragment it manifests through a patron mirror is proportional to the link the fragment has with the mirror witch. This column indicates the effective Intelligence score of the patron mirror as the witch progresses in level. The patron mirror is not a creature, and nothing can increase its Intelligence above the listed value.</p>
			<p><b>Special: </b>As a mirror witch increases in level, her patron mirror grants her additional powers as indicated on the table.</p>
			<p><i>Cryptic Omens (Ex): </i>Each day, when a mirror witch consults with her patron mirror, the patron fragment can speak a few words of cryptic advice about the witch&#146;s future. While the words are often obscure when the fragment utters them, they nearly always make sense to the witch at just the right moment aid her in dealing with the threats of the day. Once per day, after the witch receives this advice, she can gain one of the following benefits without taking an action: gain a +2 insight bonus on a saving throw she is about to attempt; gain a +2 insight bonus on a Bluff, Diplomacy, or Sense Motive check she is about to attempt; or instead of rolling initiative, treat her initiative as if she rolled a 12 on the die. She can&#146;t use this last option if she can&#146;t act during a surprise round. She doesn&#146;t choose which benefit she gains while consulting the mirror; instead, she does so when she would be about to roll a saving throw, initiative check, or appropriate skill check.</p>
			<p><i>Seek Guidance (Ex): </i>Whenever the mirror witch consults with her patron fragment, she can spend 10 minutes instead of the usual 1 minute and attempt a single Knowledge check. She gains a +2 insight bonus on any Knowledge check she attempts during such a consultation.</p>
			<p><i>Greater Omens (Ex): </i>The number of times per day that the mirror witch can use cryptic omens increases by an amount equal to the Intelligence modifier of the patron mirror. Furthermore, after consulting with her patron for 1 minute, she can expend a use of cryptic omens to gain the effects of augury instead of one of the usual three benefits.</p>
			<p><i>Specialized Knowledge (Ex) </i>The mirror witch chooses a number of Knowledge skills equal to the patron mirror&#146;s Intelligence modifier (and chooses more as the mirror&#146;s Intelligence modifier increases). When the witch consults her patron fragment with seek guidance for a Knowledge skill of one of the chosen types, the insight bonus increases by an amount equal to the mirror&#146;s Intelligence modifier. For example, at 5th and 6th levels, she gains a +4 insight bonus on a chosen Knowledge skill instead of the normal +2.</p>
			<p><i>Clairvoyance/Clairaudience (Sp): </i>By consulting her patron fragment for 10 minutes, the mirror witch can expend a single use of cryptic omens to cast clairvoyance/clairaudience as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to her witch level.</p>
			<p><i>Scrying (Sp): </i>By consulting with her patron fragment for 1 hour, the mirror witch can expend a single use of cryptic omens to use scrying as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to her witch level, using the patron mirror as the focus.</p>
			<p><i>Mirror Casting (Su): </i>When using the mirror&#146;s scrying ability, detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, detect magic, message, read magic, and tongues all function reliably through the sensor. Also, if the mirror witch is at least 15th level, there is a 5% chance each of the following spells operates successfully through the sensor: cause fear, charm person, command, crushing despair, deep slumber, enthrall, fear, hold person, moonstruckAPG, seek thoughts, and sleep; a creature that succeeds at its saving throw against one of these linked spells is forever immune to that particular mirror witch&#146;s attempts to cast that spell on that creature through her mirror.</p>
			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
					<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Mediums tap into the spiritual power of those who have yet to find their final rest. Their ability to interact with these souls allows mediums to learn about the physical world through the experiences of those who came before them. Eventually, mediums of immeasurable power learn to walk alongside the very souls that haunt their dreams and visions.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Witch's class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Witches are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a witch&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list. A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a witch&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;10. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which spells to prepare.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 2&#150;10 under &#147;Spells per Day.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 1st level, a witch gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex at 2nd level and for every 2 levels attained after 2nd level, as noted on Table 2&#150;10. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch&#146;s level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Patron: </b>A medium has a limited choice of patrons, and must select one of the following themes: ancestors, death, occult, or spirits.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch&#146;s patron adds new spells to a witch&#146;s list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to decide.</p>
			<p><b>Witch&#146;s Familiar (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
			<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>
			<p><b>Ectoplasmic Aptitude (Su): </b>At 2nd level, the medium can sling spells at ghosts and spirits as surely as at corporeal foes. She gains the Ectoplasmic SpellAPG metamagic feat as a bonus feat. In addition, as an immediate action a number of times per day equal to her Intelligence modifier, the medium can apply the Ectoplasmic SpellAPG feat to any spell she is casting without increasing its spell level. This ability replaces the witch&#146;s hex gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Shared Subconscious (Su): </b>At 6th level, a medium can temporarily link her subconscious to that of an undead creature in order to gain preternatural knowledge. As long as the medium is within 100 feet of an intelligent undead creature, as a swift action she can target said creature and attempt any trained Knowledge check. If the target has ranks in the same Knowledge skill, it also attempts the Knowledge check (if it doesn&#146;t have ranks, this effect fails). If the target&#146;s result is higher than the medium&#146;s, the medium may choose to use the undead creature&#146;s Knowledge result instead of her own, learning any information the undead creature has about the subject in question. This ability does not allow a medium to attempt a previously failed Knowledge check again. This replaces the witch&#146;s hex gained at 6th level.</p>
			<p><b>Major Hex: </b>Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<p><b>Grand Hex: </b>Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<p><b>Soul Walker (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a medium can drift into the spirit world, becoming incorporeal for 1 minute per class level. When she does so, the medium gains the incorporeal subtype, taking only half damage from corporeal magical attacks and no damage from nonmagical weapons and objects. Her spells deal only half damage to corporeal creatures, but spells and abilities that do not deal damage function normally. The duration of this ability need not be continuous, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. This replaces the witch&#146;s hex gained at 20th level.</p>
			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

					<p>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
					<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some witches tap into the power of their patrons not through a special connection with a familiar, but rather directly through the vast network of ley lines that crosses the planes. These witches can harness the latent powers of ley lines without even needing to be near one of the points where ley lines&#146; powers are accessible to mortal spellcasters.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Witch's class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

					<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>

					<p>At 2nd level, a jinx witch learns to absorb (or &#147;eat&#148;) antagonistic magical effects targeting her. If a jinx witch succeeds at a Will or Fortitude saving throw that negates a hostile spell effect, she can consume the spell energy as an immediate action. The witch treats her caster level as 1 higher when casting the next prepared spell she casts after eating a jinx in this manner. If the spell cast is of the same school as the eaten spell, the witch instead treats her caster level as 2 higher. A jinx witch can store only one eaten spell at a time, and can use this ability a number of times each day equal to 3 + her Intelligence modif ier. If the jinx witch uses this ability to eat a spell that targets more than one creature or that creates an area of effect, it uses 2 of her daily uses of the ability and all other targets or creatures in the area of effect receive a +2 bonus on their respective saving throws. If the jinx witch does not use the bonus provided by an eaten spell within 1 hour, the stored energy dissipates harmlessly.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The common perception of tengus as good luck charms has its roots in the first great empire to unify Tian Xia 7,000 years ago, when tengus were superstitious and skittish folk inhabiting the continent&#146;s central mountain ranges. Jinx witches specialize in calling down subtle misfortunes and deceiving enemies and allies alike. While they lack any ability to truly eliminate bad luck, they are uniquely gifted at making others believe otherwise. Many of these ancient traditions have been forgotten as tengus spread across the world and assimilated into other cultures, but a rare few tengus still practice this curious art of misdirection and dealing in ill fortune. A jinx witch&#146;s patron is normally Deception, Shadow, or Trickery.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Witch's class skills are Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Disguise (Cha), Fly (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

She gains an additional hex at 2nd level and for every 2 levels attained after 2nd level, as noted on Table 2&#150;10. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch&#146;s level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Patron: </b>At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch&#146;s patron adds new spells to a witch&#146;s list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to decide.</p>
			<p><b>Spell Awareness (Ex): </b>A jinx witch is skilled at identifying hostile spells and effects that target her. She adds 1/2 her witch level to Spellcraft checks to identify spells being cast if she is targeted by the spell.</p>
			<p><b>Witch&#146;s Familiar (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
			<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>
			<p><b>Jinx-Eating (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a jinx witch learns to absorb (or &#147;eat&#148;) antagonistic magical effects targeting her. If a jinx witch succeeds at a Will or Fortitude saving throw that negates a hostile spell effect, she can consume the spell energy as an immediate action. The witch treats her caster level as 1 higher when casting the next prepared spell she casts after eating a jinx in this manner. If the spell cast is of the same school as the eaten spell, the witch instead treats her caster level as 2 higher. A jinx witch can store only one eaten spell at a time, and can use this ability a number of times each day equal to 3 + her Intelligence modif ier. If the jinx witch uses this ability to eat a spell that targets more than one creature or that creates an area of effect, it uses 2 of her daily uses of the ability and all other targets or creatures in the area of effect receive a +2 bonus on their respective saving throws. If the jinx witch does not use the bonus provided by an eaten spell within 1 hour, the stored energy dissipates harmlessly.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the witch&#146;s hex normally gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Jinx-Gorging (Su): </b>At 6th level, when the jinx witch applies a bonus from a spell consumed with her jinx-eating ability to a spell of the same school as the eaten spell, and of the same or lower spell level, she does not expend the prepared spell slot. She cannot affect the spell with metamagic or other effects that would change its effective spell level.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the hex normally gained at 6th level.</p>
			<p><b>Jinx-Feast (Su): </b>At 10th level, when the jinx witch uses her jinx-eating ability, she also gains the ability to cast the eaten spell as a spell-like ability, using her witch level as her caster level and her Intelligence modifier to determine the spell-like ability&#146;s saving throw DC. If the eaten spell is not on her spell list or is of a spell level higher than the witch is capable of casting herself, she must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 20 + the spell&#146;s level) in order to cast it; failing this check results in the loss of the spell-like ability with no effect.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the major hex gained at 10th level.</p>
			<p><b>Major Hex: </b>Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<p><b>Grand Hex: </b>Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, an invoker can invite spirits associated with her patron&#146;s themes into her body and mind as a swift action. This functions like a hunter&#146;s animal focus (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide 27), except she emulates facets of her patron, chosen from the list below. The invoker can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her level; this duration need not be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments.</p>
					<p>This replaces the witch&#146;s 1st-, 8th-, and 16th-level hexes.</p>
					<p>Bondage: The invoker gains a +2 enhancement bonus to her Strength. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 16th level.</p>
					<p>Bridge: The invoker treats other creatures as if their damage reduction and spell resistance were 2 lower. This increases to 5 lower at 8th level and 10 lower at 16th level.</p>
					<p>Crisis: The invoker gains a +2 enhancement bonus to her Constitution. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 16th level.</p>
					<p>Curiosity: The DCs of the invoker&#146;s hexes and patron spells increase by 1. These DCs increase by an additional 1 at 8th level and 16th level.</p>
					<p>Decisions: The invoker gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 16th level.</p>
					<p>Fortune: The invoker gains a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws. This bonus increases to +3 at 8th level and +5 at 16th level.</p>
					<p>Paradise: The invoker gains a +3 competence bonus on Acrobatics checks and concentration checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +9 at 16th level.</p>
					<p>Rapture: The invoker can increase the duration of any spell she casts on herself by 1 round. This applies only to spells with a duration other than instantaneous. This increases to 2 rounds at 8th level and 3 rounds at 16th level.</p>
					<p>Reckoning: The invoker adds an insight bonus on damage rolls from attacks made with spells and natural attacks, gaining 1 point of damage per die rolled. At 8th level, the invoker gains a +4 bonus to confirm critical hits threatened with spells and natural attacks. At 16th level, the critical threat range of the invoker&#146;s spells and natural attacks doubles, as if from Improved Critical.</p>
					<p>Revelation: The invoker gains a +1 insight bonus on attack rolls made with weapons. This bonus increases to +2 at 8th level and +3 at 16th level.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The invoker uses her familiar to summon facets of her mysterious patron directly into her body, enhancing her skills and granting her powerful abilities. Whether these spiritual enhancements come from a single entity or a host of spiritual forces associated with the witch&#146;s patron can vary, and in many cases, a particular invoker never learns the truth of this matter.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Witch's class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Witches are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a witch&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list. A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a witch&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;10. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which spells to prepare.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 2&#150;10 under &#147;Spells per Day.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.</p>
			<p><b>Invoke Patron (Su): </b>At 1st level, an invoker can invite spirits associated with her patron&#146;s themes into her body and mind as a swift action. This functions like a hunter&#146;s animal focus (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide 27), except she emulates facets of her patron, chosen from the list below. The invoker can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her level; this duration need not be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments.</p>
			<p>This replaces the witch&#146;s 1st-, 8th-, and 16th-level hexes.</p>
			<p><i>Bondage: </i>The invoker gains a +2 enhancement bonus to her Strength. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 16th level.</p>
			<p><i>Bridge: </i>The invoker treats other creatures as if their damage reduction and spell resistance were 2 lower. This increases to 5 lower at 8th level and 10 lower at 16th level.</p>
			<p><i>Crisis: </i>The invoker gains a +2 enhancement bonus to her Constitution. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 16th level.</p>
			<p><i>Curiosity: </i>The DCs of the invoker&#146;s hexes and patron spells increase by 1. These DCs increase by an additional 1 at 8th level and 16th level.</p>
			<p><i>Decisions: </i>The invoker gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 16th level.</p>
			<p><i>Fortune: </i>The invoker gains a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws. This bonus increases to +3 at 8th level and +5 at 16th level.</p>
			<p><i>Paradise: </i>The invoker gains a +3 competence bonus on Acrobatics checks and concentration checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +9 at 16th level.</p>
			<p><i>Rapture: </i>The invoker can increase the duration of any spell she casts on herself by 1 round. This applies only to spells with a duration other than instantaneous. This increases to 2 rounds at 8th level and 3 rounds at 16th level.</p>
			<p><i>Reckoning: </i>The invoker adds an insight bonus on damage rolls from attacks made with spells and natural attacks, gaining 1 point of damage per die rolled. At 8th level, the invoker gains a +4 bonus to confirm critical hits threatened with spells and natural attacks. At 16th level, the critical threat range of the invoker&#146;s spells and natural attacks doubles, as if from Improved Critical.</p>
			<p><i>Revelation: </i>The invoker gains a +1 insight bonus on attack rolls made with weapons. This bonus increases to +2 at 8th level and +3 at 16th level.</p>
			<p><b>Patron: </b>At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch&#146;s patron adds new spells to a witch&#146;s list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to decide.</p>
			<p><b>Witch&#146;s Familiar (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
			<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 1st level, a witch gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex at 2nd level and for every 2 levels attained after 2nd level, as noted on Table 2&#150;10. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch&#146;s level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Major Hex: </b>Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<p><b>Grand Hex: </b>Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

				<name type="string">Channel Energy</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 2nd level, a hex channeler can call upon her patron to release a wave of energy from herself or her familiar. A good witch channels positive energy (like a good cleric), and an evil witch channels negative energy (like an evil cleric). A witch who is neither good nor evil must choose whether she channels positive or negative energy; once this choice is made, it cannot be reversed.</p>
					<p>Channeling energy causes a burst that affects all creatures of one type (either undead or living) in a 30-foot radius centered on the witch. The witch can channel energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). This otherwise functions as a cleric using channel energy, except the witch does not require a holy symbol to use this ability. The hex channeler uses her witch level as her cleric level for all other effects dependent upon channel energy (except increasing the amount of damage healed or dealt). The hex channeler can choose whether or not to include herself or her familiar in this effect.</p>
					<p>This burst heals or deals 1d6 points of damage. Every time the hex channeler is able to learn a new hex (including major or grand hexes, but not hexes gained through the Extra Hex feat), she can instead increase her channel energy amount by 1d6. This ability replaces the hex gained at 2nd level.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A hex channeler is a witch who devotes herself to either life&#151;healing the wounded and destroying the undead&#151;or death, slaying the living and aiding undead.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Witch's class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Witches are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a witch&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list. A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a witch&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;10. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which spells to prepare.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 2&#150;10 under &#147;Spells per Day.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 1st level, a witch gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex at 2nd level and for every 2 levels attained after 2nd level, as noted on Table 2&#150;10. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch&#146;s level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Patron: </b>At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch&#146;s patron adds new spells to a witch&#146;s list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to decide.</p>
			<p><b>Witch&#146;s Familiar (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
			<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>
			<p><b>Channel Energy (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a hex channeler can call upon her patron to release a wave of energy from herself or her familiar. A good witch channels positive energy (like a good cleric), and an evil witch channels negative energy (like an evil cleric). A witch who is neither good nor evil must choose whether she channels positive or negative energy; once this choice is made, it cannot be reversed.</p>
			<p>Channeling energy causes a burst that affects all creatures of one type (either undead or living) in a 30-foot radius centered on the witch. The witch can channel energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). This otherwise functions as a cleric using channel energy, except the witch does not require a holy symbol to use this ability. The hex channeler uses her witch level as her cleric level for all other effects dependent upon channel energy (except increasing the amount of damage healed or dealt). The hex channeler can choose whether or not to include herself or her familiar in this effect.</p>
			<p>This burst heals or deals 1d6 points of damage. Every time the hex channeler is able to learn a new hex (including major or grand hexes, but not hexes gained through the Extra Hex feat), she can instead increase her channel energy amount by 1d6. This ability replaces the hex gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Major Hex: </b>Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<p><b>Grand Hex: </b>Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

					<p>Herb witches are masters of herbalism, and they can use what they gather from garden or grove to duplicate many of the effects of alchemy. An herb witch can attempt Profession (herbalist) checks in place of Craft (alchemy) checks, and she gains a bonus on Profession (herbalist) checks equal to half her class level.</p>
					<p>Herb witches are adept at brewing thick herbal cure-alls called remedies. An herb witch prepares these remedies while communing with her familiar, during which she can prepare a number of remedies equal to 3 + her Intelligence modifier (minimum 1 remedy). A remedy becomes inert if it leaves the herb witch&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to her keeping. A witch can never have more remedies than 3 + her Intelligence modifier.</p>
					<p>As a standard action, the herb witch can administer a remedy to herself or a creature within reach which consumes the remedy. The herb witch attempts a Profession (herbalist) check against the save DC of any one disease or poison currently afflicting the consumer. If she is successful, the affliction is suppressed for 1 minute. At 10th level, if she exceeds the DC of the check by 10 or more, the affliction immediately ends. If the disease or poison doesn&#146;t allow saving throws, the remedy is ineffective.</p>
					<p>An herb witch can also use a remedy to attempt to remove the blinded, deafened, fatigued, nauseated, sickened, and staggered conditions. This requires a Profession (herbalist) check with a DC equal to the spell or effect that caused the condition, or a DC 25 check if the condition was caused by an effect that doesn&#146;t allow a saving throw. If the herb witch succeeds, the condition is removed unless the condition is permanent; at 10th level, if the herb witch succeeds by 10 or more, her remedy can remove a permanent condition.</p>
					<p>Only a single condition, disease, or poison can be removed with each application of a remedy, and a creature can only benefit from one herbal remedy each day, whether or not the herb witch succeeds at her skill check.</p>

			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Witches are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a witch&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list. A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a witch&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;10. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which spells to prepare.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 2&#150;10 under &#147;Spells per Day.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.</p>
			<p><b>Herb Lore (Ex): </b>Herb witches are masters of herbalism, and they can use what they gather from garden or grove to duplicate many of the effects of alchemy. An herb witch can attempt Profession (herbalist) checks in place of Craft (alchemy) checks, and she gains a bonus on Profession (herbalist) checks equal to half her class level.</p>
			<p>Herb witches are adept at brewing thick herbal cure-alls called remedies. An herb witch prepares these remedies while communing with her familiar, during which she can prepare a number of remedies equal to 3 + her Intelligence modifier (minimum 1 remedy). A remedy becomes inert if it leaves the herb witch&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to her keeping. A witch can never have more remedies than 3 + her Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>As a standard action, the herb witch can administer a remedy to herself or a creature within reach which consumes the remedy. The herb witch attempts a Profession (herbalist) check against the save DC of any one disease or poison currently afflicting the consumer. If she is successful, the affliction is suppressed for 1 minute. At 10th level, if she exceeds the DC of the check by 10 or more, the affliction immediately ends. If the disease or poison doesn&#146;t allow saving throws, the remedy is ineffective.</p>
			<p>An herb witch can also use a remedy to attempt to remove the blinded, deafened, fatigued, nauseated, sickened, and staggered conditions. This requires a Profession (herbalist) check with a DC equal to the spell or effect that caused the condition, or a DC 25 check if the condition was caused by an effect that doesn&#146;t allow a saving throw. If the herb witch succeeds, the condition is removed unless the condition is permanent; at 10th level, if the herb witch succeeds by 10 or more, her remedy can remove a permanent condition.</p>
			<p>Only a single condition, disease, or poison can be removed with each application of a remedy, and a creature can only benefit from one herbal remedy each day, whether or not the herb witch succeeds at her skill check.</p>
			<p>This replaces the hexes gained at 1st and 10th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Patron: </b>An herb witch must choose a patron with a theme compatible with the needs of the natural world, selected from the following list: ancestors, animals, death, elements, healing, plague, strength, time, water, winter, wisdom, or woodlands.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch&#146;s patron adds new spells to a witch&#146;s list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to decide.</p>
			<p><b>Witch&#146;s Familiar (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
			<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a witch gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex at 4th level and for every 2 levels attained after 2nd level, as noted on Table 2&#150;10. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch&#146;s level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Major Hex: </b>Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<p><b>Grand Hex: </b>Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

					<p>A hedge witch can minister to a diseased or poisoned target, redirecting the affliction into herself.

For a diseased target, the witch must tend to the sick person for an hour; he makes his next saving throw against the disease as normal, but the witch suffers the effects of the failed save instead of the diseased creature. The witch does not actually become poisoned or diseased (and is not contagious and does not need to be cured), but suffers the effects of the affliction as if she had been. The witch normally uses this ability to extend the life of someone near death, giving him time to recover. This ability has no effect if the witch is immune to disease or poison.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Among witches, there are those who devote themselves to the care of others and restrict their practices to the healing arts. They often take the place of clerics in rural communities and may wander the countryside servicing the needs of several small communities.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Witch's class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Witches are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a witch&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list. A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a witch&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;10. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which spells to prepare.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 2&#150;10 under &#147;Spells per Day.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 1st level, a witch gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex at 2nd level and for every 2 levels attained after 2nd level, as noted on Table 2&#150;10. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch&#146;s level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Patron: </b>A hedge witch&#146;s patron is normally one with a healing theme.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch&#146;s patron adds new spells to a witch&#146;s list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to decide.</p>
			<p><b>Witch&#146;s Familiar (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
			<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Healing (Su): </b>A hedge witch can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that she did not prepare ahead of time. The witch can &#147;lose&#148; any prepared spell that is not an orison in order to cast any cure spell of the same spell level or lower, even if she doesn&#146;t know that cure spell. This replaces the witch&#146;s hex gained at 4th level.</p>
			<p><b>Empathic Healing (Su): </b>A hedge witch can minister to a diseased or poisoned target, redirecting the affliction into herself. For a poisoned target, the witch must tend to him as a standard action; he makes his next saving throw against the poison as normal, but the witch suffers the effects of the failed save instead of the poisoned creature. For a diseased target, the witch must tend to the sick person for an hour; he makes his next saving throw against the disease as normal, but the witch suffers the effects of the failed save instead of the diseased creature. The witch does not actually become poisoned or diseased (and is not contagious and does not need to be cured), but suffers the effects of the affliction as if she had been. The witch normally uses this ability to extend the life of someone near death, giving him time to recover. This ability has no effect if the witch is immune to disease or poison. This replaces the witch&#146;s hex gained at 8th level.</p>
			<p><b>Major Hex: </b>Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<p><b>Grand Hex: </b>Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

At 1st level, rather than selecting a standard patron and gaining patron spells, the witch selects a specific kineticist element (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 14), which represents the shadowy forces from which she gains her familiar and class powers. The havocker gains the elemental focus and kinetic blast class features with the associated element, using her witch level as her effective kineticist level. If the havocker takes levels in another class that grants an elemental focus, the elemental focuses must be the same type, even if that means that the elemental focus of one of the classes must change. Subject to GM discretion, the havocker can change her former elemental focus to make them conform.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Although most witches are guided to subtle curses and debilitating hexes by their mysterious patrons, some are instead taught the secrets of harnessing raw, destructive elemental power.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Witch's class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Witches are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a witch&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list. A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a witch&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;10. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which spells to prepare.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 2&#150;10 under &#147;Spells per Day.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.</p>
			<p><b>Patron: </b>At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch&#146;s patron adds new spells to a witch&#146;s list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to decide.</p>
			<p><b>Patron Element: </b>A havocker&#146;s patron grants her the ability to devastate her foes with a specific element. At 1st level, rather than selecting a standard patron and gaining patron spells, the witch selects a specific kineticist element (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 14), which represents the shadowy forces from which she gains her familiar and class powers. The havocker gains the elemental focus and kinetic blast class features with the associated element, using her witch level as her effective kineticist level. If the havocker takes levels in another class that grants an elemental focus, the elemental focuses must be the same type, even if that means that the elemental focus of one of the classes must change. Subject to GM discretion, the havocker can change her former elemental focus to make them conform.</p>
			<p>This ability alters the witch&#146;s familiar and replaces the witch&#146;s 1st-level hex.</p>
			<p><b>Witch&#146;s Familiar (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
			<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>
			<p><b>Infusion: </b>At 2nd level and every 4 witch levels thereafter, the havocker gains an infusion wild talent from the list of options available based on her elemental focus, functioning as the kineticist ability of the same name. A havocker must meet the prerequisites of the infusion wild talent and can&#146;t accept burn (but see the spellburn ability below).</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the witch&#146;s hexes from 2nd level on, major hex, and grand hex.</p>
			<p><b>Spellburn: </b>Beginning at 2nd level, a havocker can channel stored spell energy into her kinetic blast to increase the blast&#146;s overall utility and power. To use her inf sions, the havocker must lose a prepared witch spell to apply the infusion to her kinetic blast. Any spell sacrificed is required to have a spell level equal to or greater than the infusion&#146;s effective spell level. The havocker cannot accept additional burn if the infusion would allow her to do so.</p>
			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

Until then, she can&#146;t take levels in any class other than witch and her alignment can never become good.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Whether a changeling in the process of succumbing to her mother&#146;s call, a witch cursed by a hag to become her instrument of torment, a vain and petty witch overeager for power, or some other unfortunate soul, a hagbound witch finds its soul has been infected by a hag&#146;s spite and powerful, corrupt arcane magic. Her mind and body begin to transform to reflect her new being. Hagbound witches suffer a slow transformative taint that is similar to the accursed corruption (Pathfinder RPG Horror Adventures 16) and make ideal candidates for this additional power&#151;and tragedy.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Witch's class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Witches are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a witch&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list. A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a witch&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;10. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which spells to prepare.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 2&#150;10 under &#147;Spells per Day.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.</p>
			<p><b>Hagbound: </b>A hagbound can take this archetype only if her first character level is a witch level, and she must select one of the following patrons: Deception, Jynx, Moon, Occult, Plague, Shadow, Strength, Vengeance, or Winter. She can escape her inevitable fate only by removing the hag&#146;s hold on her soul, typically with miracle or an effect of similar power. Until then, she can&#146;t take levels in any class other than witch and her alignment can never become good. Removing the hag&#146;s hold causes her to lose this archetype and become a normal witch.</p>
			<p><b>Hag&#146;s Claws (Ex): </b>A hagbound&#146;s hands grow into a pair of hideous claws that deal 1d4 points of damage for a Medium hagbound (1d3 for a Small creature).</p>
			<p>This replaces the hex gained at 1st level.</p>
			<p><b>Patron: </b>At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch&#146;s patron adds new spells to a witch&#146;s list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to decide.</p>
			<p><b>Witch&#146;s Familiar (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
			<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>
			<p><b>Hunched Muscle (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, warty growths and knobby muscles twist the hagbound&#146;s body. She gains a +2 size bonus to her Strength score. This bonus increases by 2 at 8th level and 14th level, to a maximum of +6.</p>
			<p>This replaces the hexes gained at 2nd, 8th, and 14th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Vain Glamour (Sp): </b>At 4th level, the hagbound gains the ability to disguise her hideous form behind various pleasing shapes. This allows her to magically disguise herself at will, as per disguise self. At 12th level, she can transform herself at will rather than spin illusions, as per alter self.</p>
			<p>This replaces the hexes gained at 4th and 12th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Hex </b>: Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 6th level, a witch gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex as noted on Table 2&#150;10. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch&#146;s level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Major Hex: </b>Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<p><b>Vile Curse (Sp): </b>At 10th level, the hagbound becomes exceptionally skilled at cursing others. She can cast bestow curse at will, but its duration becomes 24 hours. Once a creature has been affected by this ability, it is immune to the witch&#146;s vile curse ability for 24 hours. If the witch learns some secret fear or vulnerability of her target and tailors the curse to exploit this, her target takes a &#150;2 penalty on its Will saving throw against the effect.</p>
			<p>This replaces the hex gained at 10th level.</p>
			<p><b>Grand Hex: </b>Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<p><b>Hag Transformation: </b>At 20th level, the hagbound transforms into a true hag, purging all goodness and light from her in exchange for dark power. Her alignment becomes evil if it isn&#146;t already. Her type changes to monstrous humanoid, and she gains darkvision 60 feet; immunity to charm, fear, and spell effects; and the ability to join a coven. She gains spell resistance 31, and she grants this benefit to her other coven members.</p>
			<p>This replaces the hex gained at 20th level.</p>
			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

Once per day, after the hag of Gyronna has successfully affected a creature within 30 feet with a mind-affecting spell, spell-like ability, or hex with a duration of longer than 1 round, she can choose to dismiss the mind-affecting effect as an immediate action. If she dismisses this effect in response to another creature targeting her victim with a beneficial spell or ability, the witch&#146;s effect is dismissed and the caster of the beneficial spell or ability must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the witch&#146;s level + her Intelligence modifier) or the spell or ability is wasted to no effect and the targeted victim takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. At 14th and 20th levels, a hag of Gyronna can use this ability an additional time per day. This ability replaces the witch&#146;s 8th-level hex.</p>

The night hag serves the hag of Gyronna to the best of its ability as long as the witch&#146;s commands are consistent with the night hag&#146;s alignment and goals, but flees back to its native plane after a number of rounds equal to the witch&#146;s level or upon losing half or more of its hit points.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Only female witches dare dedicate themselves to the Angry Hag, and those who do so are feared for their ability to bend minds and sow discord. Some say these witches can watch their enemies from afar and can even corrupt the minds of the most innocent or loyal, including newborn babes and cherished pets.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Witch's class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Witches are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a witch&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list. A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a witch&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;10. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which spells to prepare.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 2&#150;10 under &#147;Spells per Day.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 1st level, a witch gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex as noted on Table 2&#150;10. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch&#146;s level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Patron: </b>A hag of Gyronna must choose Deception, Trickery, VengeanceUM, or Water as her witch patron. A hag of Gyronna replaces several of her patron spells with the following: 2nd&#151;doom, 6th&#151;obscure object, 10th&#151;commune, 14th&#151;repulsion, 18th&#151;shapechange.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch&#146;s patron adds new spells to a witch&#146;s list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to decide.</p>
			<p><b>Witch&#146;s Familiar (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
			<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>
			<p><b>Curdle Thoughts (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a hag of Gyronna can insert negative emotions into the mind of a single target. She gains a +2 bonus on Diplomacy and Bluff checks to sow suspicion, hatred, or other forms of animosity. In addition, a hag of Gyronna can choose to increase the save DC of any spell with the fear descriptor she casts by 2. She can increase a spell&#146;s DC in this way a number of times per day equal to 1/2 her witch level. This ability replaces the witch&#146;s 2nd-level hex.</p>
			<p><b>Sunder Hope (Su): </b>At 8th level, a hag of Gyronna can violently dismiss her curses to counter magical boons and impose her own capricious whims. Once per day, after the hag of Gyronna has successfully affected a creature within 30 feet with a mind-affecting spell, spell-like ability, or hex with a duration of longer than 1 round, she can choose to dismiss the mind-affecting effect as an immediate action. If she dismisses this effect in response to another creature targeting her victim with a beneficial spell or ability, the witch&#146;s effect is dismissed and the caster of the beneficial spell or ability must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the witch&#146;s level + her Intelligence modifier) or the spell or ability is wasted to no effect and the targeted victim takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. At 14th and 20th levels, a hag of Gyronna can use this ability an additional time per day. This ability replaces the witch&#146;s 8th-level hex.</p>
			<p><b>Major Hex: </b>Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<p><b>Hag Crony (Su): </b>At 12th level, a hag of Gyronna gains a blessing from the Angry Hag in the form of an alliance with a night hag (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 215). Once per week, the hag of Gyronna can as a full-round action summon the night hag from the Shadow Plane. The night hag serves the hag of Gyronna to the best of its ability as long as the witch&#146;s commands are consistent with the night hag&#146;s alignment and goals, but flees back to its native plane after a number of rounds equal to the witch&#146;s level or upon losing half or more of its hit points. The night hag may provide the hag of Gyronna with other favors or gifts at the GM&#146;s discretion. At 15th and 18th levels, a hag of Gyronna can call upon her hag crony an additional time per week. This ability replaces the witch&#146;s 12th-level hex.</p>
			<p><b>Grand Hex: </b>Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

The gravewalker must commune with her poppet each day to prepare her spells and cannot prepare spells that are not stored in the poppet. This ability replaces familiar. The following familiar ability works differently for a gravewalker:</p>
					<p><i>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </i>At 3rd level or higher, a gravewalker can use her poppet to deliver touch spells. After casting a touch spell, as a full-round action, the witch can designate a target and stab a pin into her poppet, delivering the spell as a ranged touch attack. The target must be within range of her aura of desecration ability (see below).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Having much in common with necromancers, the gravewalker is obsessed with the occult manipulations of the dead, particularly mindless undead such as zombies. Unlike the creations of standard necromancers, a gravewalker&#146;s creations remain forever tied to her will, and she can produce vile apparitions of tremendous power.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Witch's class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Witches are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a witch&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list. A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a witch&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;10. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which spells to prepare.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Desecration (Su): </b>At first level, a gravewalker can create a 20-foot-radius aura of evil power. This aura increases the DC of channeled negative energy by +1 and the turn resistance of undead by +1. At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the radius of the aura increases by 5 feet, to a maximum of 70 feet at 20th level. This ability replaces the witch&#146;s 1st-level hex.</p>
			<p><b>Bonethrall (Su): </b>At first level, a gravewalker can take control of an undead creature within her aura of desecration by forcing her will upon it (Will negates, using her hex DC). If it fails the save, the creature falls under her control as if she had used command undead (once control is established, the undead remain controlled even if outside the witch&#146;s aura). Intelligent undead receive a new saving throw each day to resist her command. The witch can control up to 1 HD of undead creatures per caster level. If an undead creature is under the control of another creature, the witch must make an opposed Charisma check whenever her orders conflict with that creature&#146;s. This replaces the witch&#146;s hex gained at 4th level</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 2&#150;10 under &#147;Spells per Day.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.</p>
			<p><b>Patron: </b>A gravewalker replaces some of her patron spells with the following: 4th&#151;command undead, 6th&#151;animate dead, 12th&#151;create undead, 14th&#151;control undead, 16th&#151;create greater undead. These replace the patron spells.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch&#146;s patron adds new spells to a witch&#146;s list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to decide.</p>
			<p><b>Spell Poppet: </b>Each gravewalker carries around a gristly, inanimate poppet stitched from human skin and stuffed with shards of bone, fingernails, and grave dirt. A gravewalker&#146;s spells come from the will of evil spirits residing in the poppet, and its ability to hold spells functions in a manner identical to the way a witch&#146;s spells are granted by her familiar. The gravewalker must commune with her poppet each day to prepare her spells and cannot prepare spells that are not stored in the poppet. This ability replaces familiar. The following familiar ability works differently for a gravewalker:</p>
			<p><i>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </i>At 3rd level or higher, a gravewalker can use her poppet to deliver touch spells. After casting a touch spell, as a full-round action, the witch can designate a target and stab a pin into her poppet, delivering the spell as a ranged touch attack. The target must be within range of her aura of desecration ability (see below).</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a witch gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex at 2nd level as noted on Table 2&#150;10. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch&#146;s level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Possess Undead (Sp): </b>A gravewalker may take direct control of one of her undead minions within her aura of desecration, as if using magic jar; the witch&#146;s poppet acts as the soul receptacle for this ability. The minion gets no saving throw against this ability. This replaces the witch&#146;s hex gained at 8th level.</p>
			<p><b>Major Hex: </b>Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<p><b>Grand Hex: </b>Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
					<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>

					<p>At 12th level, a gingerbread witch gains a bite attack that deals 1d6 points of damage for a Medium witch. As a full-round action, she can make a single bite attack that deals double base damage (2d6 for a Medium witch) and functions as if she had the grab and swallow whole special attacks, allowing her to grab and swallow a creature of her size or smaller. Her stomach doesn&#146;t deal damage to swallowed creatures, but a living creature she swallows must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 her witch level + Constitution modifier) at the beginning of each of its turns or become nauseated for 1 round.</p>
					<p>If a gingerbread witch successfully swallows a creature, her torso distends grotesquely and she is treated as if she were carrying a heavy load if the creature is the same size and a medium load if it&#146;s one size smaller; regardless, she can swallow only one such creature at a time. Creatures two or more sizes smaller do not distend her belly, though every four creatures of a smaller size count as one creature one size category larger (she can swallow 4 Tiny, 16 Diminutive, or 64 Fine creatures). She can regurgitate a swallowed creature of her choice as a move action, leaving it prone in an adjacent open square. If she is struck with a confirmed critical hit while she has a creature swallowed, the swallowed creatures each take half as much damage as the witch does (this doesn&#146;t reduce the damage the gingerbread witch takes).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A sweet tooth lures the gingerbread witch&#146;s victims to doom.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Witch's class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Witches are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a witch&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list. A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a witch&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;10. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which spells to prepare.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 2&#150;10 under &#147;Spells per Day.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.</p>
			<p><b>Cauldron Cook (Ex): </b>A gingerbread witch gains the cauldron and child-scentUM hexes at 1st level. When brewing potions with her cauldron, she can create small candies, pastries, or similar edible items identical in effect and application to normal potions. At 10th level, she gains the cook peopleUM hex.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the hexes gained at 1st and 10th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Gingerbread Familiar (Ex): </b>A gingerbread witch concocts her familiar out of gingerbread, sugar, and other confections. It has the shape of the original animal or vermin, but its type changes to construct. As a construct, it gains 60-foot darkvision and construct immunities, it loses any special abilities the animal or vermin has other than movement speed, and it doesn&#146;t provide the usual familiar benefit (for instance, a gingerbread toad doesn&#146;t provide 3 bonus hit points). With a supply of flour and sugar at hand, the gingerbread witch can spend 8 hours and use her cauldron to restore her familiar to full health at no cost, unless the familiar is destroyed, in which case she must follow the usual rules for replacing her familiar. A gingerbread witch can never gain an improved familiar.</p>
			<p>This ability alters familiar.</p>
			<p><b>Patron: </b>At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch&#146;s patron adds new spells to a witch&#146;s list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to decide.</p>
			<p><b>Witch&#146;s Familiar (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
			<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a witch gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex as noted on Table 2&#150;10. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch&#146;s level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Tricky Treats Hex (Sp): </b>At 4th level, a gingerbread witch learns a unique hex that lets her create a piece of candy or a similar sweet as a full-round action. If eaten by the witch or a single creature she designates when she creates it, the sweet functions as goodberry or a polypurpose panaceaUM (as determined at creation).</p>
			<p>Anyone else that eats the sweet becomes nauseated (Fortitude negates); a creature nauseated by the sweet can attempt a new saving throw each round at the end of its turn to end this effect. A creature that fails its initial save is also affected as per the scarUM hex for a number of days equal to the witch&#146;s witch level, except that at extended range, the witch can use only harmful hexes on the creature. She can create a number of sweets each day equal to her Intelligence modifier + her level. These sweets retain their potency for 24 hours and then turn to crumbs.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the hex gained at 4th level.</p>
			<p><b>Confection Conjuring (Sp): </b>At 8th level, a gingerbread witch can use shadow conjuration as a spell-like ability. Items and creatures she conjures appear to be made of fanciful foodstuffs, and because of this, sentient creatures gain a +2 bonus on Will saves to disbelieve the illusion. However, they otherwise function as described for the shadow conjuration spell. For every 3 witch levels beyond 8th, the gingerbread witch can duplicate conjuration (creation) and conjuration (summoning) spells of 1 level higher, up to a maximum of 7th-level spell effects at 20th level (though they are still only 20% real). The witch can use this ability once per day for every 4 witch levels she has.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the hex gained at 8th level.</p>
			<p><b>Major Hex: </b>Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<p><b>Gruesome Gobbler (Ex): </b>At 12th level, a gingerbread witch gains a bite attack that deals 1d6 points of damage for a Medium witch. As a full-round action, she can make a single bite attack that deals double base damage (2d6 for a Medium witch) and functions as if she had the grab and swallow whole special attacks, allowing her to grab and swallow a creature of her size or smaller. Her stomach doesn&#146;t deal damage to swallowed creatures, but a living creature she swallows must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 her witch level + Constitution modifier) at the beginning of each of its turns or become nauseated for 1 round.</p>
			<p>If a gingerbread witch successfully swallows a creature, her torso distends grotesquely and she is treated as if she were carrying a heavy load if the creature is the same size and a medium load if it&#146;s one size smaller; regardless, she can swallow only one such creature at a time. Creatures two or more sizes smaller do not distend her belly, though every four creatures of a smaller size count as one creature one size category larger (she can swallow 4 Tiny, 16 Diminutive, or 64 Fine creatures). She can regurgitate a swallowed creature of her choice as a move action, leaving it prone in an adjacent open square. If she is struck with a confirmed critical hit while she has a creature swallowed, the swallowed creatures each take half as much damage as the witch does (this doesn&#146;t reduce the damage the gingerbread witch takes).</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the hex gained at 12th level.</p>
			<p><b>Horrible Hunger (Sp): </b>At 16th level, a gingerbread witch can affect a target as if she had cast feast of ashesAPG on it, but with her hex DC instead of the spell&#146;s DC. This hunger is so intense that any creature can offer the target food as a standard action and the target is compelled to eat it, as if the creature offering it had cast beguiling giftAPG (with a DC and caster level equal to that of the witch&#146;s hexes). She can use this ability once per day for every 4 witch levels she has.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the hex gained at 16th level.</p>
			<p><b>Grand Hex: </b>Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

					<p>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path.

					<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Witches who dwell in floodplains or along the banks of predictably dangerous rivers can tap into the underlying potential of surging waters in order to enhance their eerie powers.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Flood walkers exult in the final gasp for air of a drowning victim and must be evil in alignment. A flood walker who becomes nonevil loses access to all abilities granted by this archetype but does not regain any abilities this archetype replaced.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Witch's class skills are Craft (Int), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p>A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;10. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which spells to prepare.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 2&#150;10 under &#147;Spells per Day.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.</p>
			<p><b>Gasping Breath Aura (Su): </b>A creature attempting to hold its breath within 30 feet of a flood walker is treated as having taken a standard or full-round action when determining how long it can hold its breath, regardless of the number and type of actions it takes in a round. At 5th level, increase the DC of Swim checks attempted within 30 feet of the flood walker by 5, and creatures actively engaged in combat or a similarly strenuous activity use air twice as quickly within the aura. The flood walker can exempt creatures within this aura from these increased penalties.</p>
			<p>This replaces the hex gained at 1st level.</p>
			<p><b>Patron: </b>Regardless of which patron a flood walker selects, he replaces some of his patron spells with the following: 4th&#151;aboleth&#146;s lung, 10th&#151;suffocation, 16th&#151; seamantle, 18th&#151;mass suffocation.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch&#146;s patron adds new spells to a witch&#146;s list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to decide.</p>
			<p><b>Witch&#146;s Familiar (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
			<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a witch gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex as noted on Table 2&#150;10. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch&#146;s level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p><b>River Stride (Su): </b>At 6th level, a flood walker and his familiar can walk on the surface of water and other liquids as if under the effects of a water walk spell. The flood walker chooses at the beginning of his turn each round whether this ability is active or suppressed (for himself and his familiar separately), allowing him to walk on water or swim.</p>
			<p>This replaces the hex gained at 6th level.</p>
			<p><b>Breath Siphon (Su): </b>At 10th level, a flood walker gains strength from his patron when creatures suffocate or drown. Whenever a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher asphyxiates or drowns within 30 feet of him, the flood walker gains the benefit of a death knell spell for 1 hour. If a flood walker drowns such a victim himself (such as by holding a grappled or helpless creature under water until it dies or by killing it with a suffocation spell), the duration is doubled, and the flood walker gains 4d8 temporary hit points and a +6 enhancement bonus to Strength instead of the usual temporary hit points and enhancement bonus to Strength from death knell. Like death knell itself, this is an evil act.</p>
			<p><b>Major Hex: </b>Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<p><b>Grand Hex: </b>Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

					<p>At 2nd level, when a dreamweaver casts a mind-affecting spell on a target that is sleeping because of her slumber hex or a spell she cast, she adds +1 to the mind-affecting spell&#146;s DC. If the target succeeds at the saving throw against the spell, it does not wake up, nor does it have any recollection of having resisted a spell. If appropriate, the dreamweaver may incorporate elements of a mind-affecting spell (i.e., sow thought, suggestion, and so on) into the target&#146;s subconscious so it believes the spell&#146;s effects originated in its dreams (the details of how these elements fit into the dream is up to the GM).

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A changeling dreamweaver draws upon her hag heritage to ply the dream realms in order to touch mortal minds and souls, for good or ill. A dreamweaver witch has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Race: </b>Changeling Only</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Witch's class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Witches are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a witch&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list. A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a witch&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;10. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which spells to prepare.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 2&#150;10 under &#147;Spells per Day.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 1st level, a witch gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex at 2nd level and for every 2 levels attained after 2nd level, as noted on Table 2&#150;10. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch&#146;s level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Patron: </b>A dreamweaver&#146;s patron is normally portents or stars. A dreamweaver replaces some of her patron&#146;s spells with the following: 2nd&#151;sow thoughts (see below), 4th&#151;dust of twilight , 6th&#151;deep slumber, 8th&#151;modify memory, 10th&#151;dream, 12th&#151;cloak of dreams , 14th&#151;ethereal jaunt, 16th&#151;moment of prescience, 18th&#151;astral projection.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch&#146;s patron adds new spells to a witch&#146;s list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to decide.</p>
			<p><b>Witch&#146;s Familiar (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
			<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>
			<p><b>Dream Spinner (Su): </b>At 2nd level, when a dreamweaver casts a mind-affecting spell on a target that is sleeping because of her slumber hex or a spell she cast, she adds +1 to the mind-affecting spell&#146;s DC. If the target succeeds at the saving throw against the spell, it does not wake up, nor does it have any recollection of having resisted a spell. If appropriate, the dreamweaver may incorporate elements of a mind-affecting spell (i.e., sow thought, suggestion, and so on) into the target&#146;s subconscious so it believes the spell&#146;s effects originated in its dreams (the details of how these elements fit into the dream is up to the GM). This ability replaces the witch&#146;s hex gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Dream Thief (Su): </b>At 6th level, a dreamweaver can alter the sleeping mind of any creature that is sleeping because of her slumber hex or a spell she cast. She can reshape one of the target&#146;s memories as if using modify memory. Alternatively, she may insert herself into the dreaming memories of the target, prompting the target&#146;s mind to show her some specific information; the dreamer&#146;s subconscious may resist, or try to deceive her with out-of-context memories, similar to the way a corpse can resist when questioned with speak with dead. A Will save negates either effect (DC equal to that of the witch&#146;s hex). Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day. This ability replaces the witch&#146;s hex gained at 6th level.</p>
			<p><b>Dream Possession (Su): </b>At 10th level, a dreamweaver can take control of any creature that is sleeping because of her slumber hex or a spell she cast. This effect functions as magic jar, using the witch&#146;s familiar acting as the soul receptacle. A Will save negates either effect (DC equal to that of the witch&#146;s hex). Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day. This ability replaces the witch&#146;s hex gained at 10th level.</p>
			<p><b>Major Hex: </b>Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<p><b>Grand Hex: </b>Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

				<name type="string">Dimensional Augmentation</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 2nd level, a dimensional occultist can augment her spells by incorporating complex mathematical equations and formulae into the casting, typically by inscribing these equations with chalk or charcoal onto a solid surface (although scribing them on paper or into wet sand works fine as well). Augmenting a spell in this way adds both a somatic component (the actual scribing of the equations) and a material component (the writing stylus and ink, chalk, charcoal, or other medium) to the spell, and increases its casting time to a number of rounds equal to the spell&#146;s level (if the spell&#146;s casting time is already 1 minute or more, the casting time is not altered). As a result, using dimensional augmentation to cast a spell isn&#146;t a good option in the heat of combat. Augmenting a spell in this manner increases its effective caster level by +1. A dimensional occultist can augment her spells in this manner once per day at 2nd level, plus one additional time per day for every even-numbered witch level she gains. This ability replaces the witch&#146;s hex gained at 2nd level.</p>

					<p>At 8th level, a dimensional occultist can use her familiar as a link between herself and strange, otherworldly intelligences on other planes. Once per week, she may use this link to cast contact other plane as a spell-like ability, at a caster level equal to her witch level. The entity contacted replies to the witch via her familiar (which speaks in a strange disembodied voice), via telepathic contact, or by some similarly disconcerting method of communication. When a witch uses this method to contact other planes, she gains a +4 bonus on the Intelligence check to avoid the decrease to Intelligence and Charisma. If she still fails the save, the Intelligence/Charisma decrease lasts only 24 hours rather than a number of weeks. This ability replaces the witch&#146;s hex gained at 8th level.</p>

					<p>At 12th level, a dimensional occultist can create a dimensional waypoint by spending 2d4 minutes inscribing a number of equations on a solid surface (such as a wall, tree, stone floor, or structure) with a writing instrument. The exact configuration of these equations is unique to each witch. From that point on, when she uses dimensional travel to travel to that location, she does so without any chance of mishap. Teleport always sends the witch to this spot, and even plane shift, if used to travel to that site, is precisely accurate. Once a dimensional waypoint is set, it remains active for that witch despite the condition of the inscription or even that of the surface upon which it was inscribed&#151;it is the act of inscribing the waypoint, not the waypoint itself, that matters. At 12th level, and then again every two witch levels thereafter, the dimensional occultist can maintain an additional waypoint. She can replace a waypoint she&#146;s already set by simply using that waypoint&#146;s unique equation at a new site. This ability replaces the witch&#146;s hex gained at 12th level.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>While dimensional occultist witches are not all associated with the Pathfinders, enough of them are to warrant mention here. A dimensional occultist sacrifices some of her mastery over hexes in return for increased planar lore&#151; she spends much of her time researching and communing with otherplanar spirits, often through her familiar or via the study of ancient texts, and has an increased mastery over various conjurations and other extraplanar effects. She can even travel between dimensions as she gains power. A dimensional occultist has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Witches are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a witch&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list. A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a witch&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;10. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which spells to prepare.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 2&#150;10 under &#147;Spells per Day.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 1st level, a witch gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex at 2nd level and for every 2 levels attained after 2nd level, as noted on Table 2&#150;10. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch&#146;s level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Patron: </b>A dimensional occultist witch does not have the same freedom of choice among her patrons as do other witches&#151;she must select the Dimensions patron when she gains this archetype. The Dimensions patron provides the following bonus spells: 2nd&#151;hold portal, 4th&#151;rope trick, 6th&#151;blink, 8th&#151;dimensional anchor, 10th&#151;lesser planar binding, 12th&#151;planar binding, 14th&#151;banishment, 16th&#151; greater planar binding, 18th&#151;gate.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch&#146;s patron adds new spells to a witch&#146;s list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to decide.</p>
			<p><b>Witch&#146;s Familiar (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
			<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>
			<p><b>Dimensional Augmentation (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a dimensional occultist can augment her spells by incorporating complex mathematical equations and formulae into the casting, typically by inscribing these equations with chalk or charcoal onto a solid surface (although scribing them on paper or into wet sand works fine as well). Augmenting a spell in this way adds both a somatic component (the actual scribing of the equations) and a material component (the writing stylus and ink, chalk, charcoal, or other medium) to the spell, and increases its casting time to a number of rounds equal to the spell&#146;s level (if the spell&#146;s casting time is already 1 minute or more, the casting time is not altered). As a result, using dimensional augmentation to cast a spell isn&#146;t a good option in the heat of combat. Augmenting a spell in this manner increases its effective caster level by +1. A dimensional occultist can augment her spells in this manner once per day at 2nd level, plus one additional time per day for every even-numbered witch level she gains. This ability replaces the witch&#146;s hex gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Commune with Familiar (Sp): </b>At 8th level, a dimensional occultist can use her familiar as a link between herself and strange, otherworldly intelligences on other planes. Once per week, she may use this link to cast contact other plane as a spell-like ability, at a caster level equal to her witch level. The entity contacted replies to the witch via her familiar (which speaks in a strange disembodied voice), via telepathic contact, or by some similarly disconcerting method of communication. When a witch uses this method to contact other planes, she gains a +4 bonus on the Intelligence check to avoid the decrease to Intelligence and Charisma. If she still fails the save, the Intelligence/Charisma decrease lasts only 24 hours rather than a number of weeks. This ability replaces the witch&#146;s hex gained at 8th level.</p>
			<p><b>Major Hex: </b>Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<p><b>Dimensional Waypoints (Ex): </b>At 12th level, a dimensional occultist can create a dimensional waypoint by spending 2d4 minutes inscribing a number of equations on a solid surface (such as a wall, tree, stone floor, or structure) with a writing instrument. The exact configuration of these equations is unique to each witch. From that point on, when she uses dimensional travel to travel to that location, she does so without any chance of mishap. Teleport always sends the witch to this spot, and even plane shift, if used to travel to that site, is precisely accurate. Once a dimensional waypoint is set, it remains active for that witch despite the condition of the inscription or even that of the surface upon which it was inscribed&#151;it is the act of inscribing the waypoint, not the waypoint itself, that matters. At 12th level, and then again every two witch levels thereafter, the dimensional occultist can maintain an additional waypoint. She can replace a waypoint she&#146;s already set by simply using that waypoint&#146;s unique equation at a new site. This ability replaces the witch&#146;s hex gained at 12th level.</p>
			<p><b>Grand Hex: </b>Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The drow are among the best known creatures on Golarion who were &#147;saved&#148; by demonic intervention, but they&#146;re far from the only ones. In the depths of the Darklands, as well as similarly inhospitable locales on Golarion, many seek the succor of demons as a means of survival. Such pacts are often made in haste, without a true understanding of the lifelong effects they&#146;ll have on those who make them.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Witch's class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Witches are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a witch&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list. A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a witch&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;10. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which spells to prepare.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 2&#150;10 under &#147;Spells per Day.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.</p>
			<p><b>Cruel Hex: </b>A demon-sworn always inflicts some pain, whether she wants to or not. Each hex deals 1d4 points of nonlethal damage to creatures affected by it, in addition to any damage the hex normally deals.</p>
			<p>For major hexes, the damage increases to 2d4. For grand hexes, the damage increases to 4d4. Each die result of a natural 4 deals 1 point of lethal damage to the demon-sworn.</p>
			<p>This ability alters the witch&#146;s hex, major hex, and grand hex.</p>
			<p><b>Demonic Pact: </b>A demon-sworn makes a pact with a demonic entity, forever binding her to the forces of the Abyss and corrupting her connection with her patron. At the indicated levels, she gains the spells below in place of her normal patron spells: 2nd&#151;protection from good, 6th&#151;unholy blight, 10th&#151;dispel good, 14th&#151;blasphemy, 18th&#151;unholy aura. Casting spells with the evil descriptor from this replacement list has no effect on the demonsworn&#146;s alignment.</p>
			<p>This ability modifies patron spells.</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 1st level, a witch gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex at 2nd level and for every 2 levels attained after 2nd level, as noted on Table 2&#150;10. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch&#146;s level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Patron: </b>A demon-sworn makes a pact with a demonic entity, forever binding her to the forces of the Abyss and corrupting her connection with her patron. At the indicated levels, she gains the spells below in place of her normal patron spells: 2nd&#151;protection from good, 6th&#151;unholy blight, 10th&#151;dispel good, 14th&#151;blasphemy, 18th&#151;unholy aura. Casting spells with the evil descriptor from this replacement list has no effect on the demonsworn&#146;s alignment.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch&#146;s patron adds new spells to a witch&#146;s list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to decide.</p>
			<p><b>Witch&#146;s Familiar (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
			<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>
			<p><b>Manifest Pact (Ex): </b>At 6th level, the demon-sworn gains Improved Familiar as a bonus feat. The associated familiar is made up of the tiny amount of soul matter lost when the demon-sworn made her pact with demonic powers. The familiar must be a quasit, regardless of the demon-sworn&#146;s actual alignment, and it manifests by eating its way out of the demon-sworn&#146;s former familiar. The quasit knows all spells known to the previous familiar. It loyally serves the demon-sworn, despite any conflicts of alignment, obeying its mistress to the best of its abilities.</p>
			<p>This familiar cannot be replaced, and if slain, the ritual to replace the lost familiar recreates the same quasit, along with the same spells previously known. Replacing the familiar in this fashion also imparts the demon-sworn with 1 permanent negative level, as if she had been hit by an energy-draining creature.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the hex gained at 6th level.</p>
			<p><b>Major Hex: </b>Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<p><b>Grand Hex: </b>Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Coral witches inhabit shallow coasts and reefs where great masses of coral grow. They use their magic to fashion familiars from living coral and emulate the unyielding tenacity of these durable marine organisms. Many coral witches actively patrol and protect their home reefs from predators and help to rebuild the reefs after natural disasters. Although most coral witches are aquatic creatures such as gillmen and locathahs, surface creatures with a deep connection to the sea sometimes become coral witches as well.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Witch's class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Witches are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a witch&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list. A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a witch&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;10. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which spells to prepare.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 2&#150;10 under &#147;Spells per Day.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.</p>
			<p><b>Coral Familiar (Ex): </b>A coral witch crafts her familiar out of living coral, coaxing the tiny organisms to grow in the shape of a larger animal or vermin. The coral witch chooses a familiar as normal, but its type changes to vermin (aquatic) and it gains the amphibious special quality. The coral witch&#146;s familiar has an Intelligence score as normal for the witch&#146;s level, but it has immunity to mind-affecting effects. When underwater near a coral reef of any size, a coral witch can spend 8 hours to restore her familiar to full health at no cost, unless the familiar is killed, in which case she must follow the usual rules for replacing her familiar. A coral witch can never gain an improved familiar.</p>
			<p>This ability alters witch&#146;s familiar.</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 1st level, a witch gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex at 2nd level and for every 2 levels attained after 2nd level, as noted on Table 2&#150;10. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch&#146;s level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Patron: </b>A coral witch&#146;s patron is normally endurance, healingUM, or water, although a coral witch can select any patron other than those associated with fire.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch&#146;s patron adds new spells to a witch&#146;s list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to decide.</p>
			<p><b>Waves Spirit Hex: </b>A coral witch can select hexes from the shaman&#146;s waves spirit (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide 45) as if they were witch hexes. She uses her witch level as her shaman level to determine the effect of the hex and Intelligence instead of Wisdom to determine its DC.</p>
			<p>This ability alters hex.</p>
			<p><b>Witch&#146;s Familiar (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
			<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>
			<p><b>Immovability (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a coral witch can naturally emulate coral&#146;s ability to affix itself in place. At the end of any round in which the coral witch did not move from her space and is standing on solid ground, she adds her class level to her CMD against any bull rush, overrun, and reposition combat maneuvers, grapple attempts to move her, and attempts to pull or push her. This bonus lasts until the start of the coral witch&#146;s next turn.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the hex gained at 8th level.</p>
			<p><b>Major Hex: </b>Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<p><b>Grand Hex: </b>Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

					<p>A bouda&#146;s gaze can bestow ill fortune on her enemies. This hex can affect a creature within 30 feet that the bouda can see. The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on one of the following (bouda&#146;s choice): AC, ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, or skill checks. The hex lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the bouda&#146;s Intelligence modifier. A successful Will saving throw reduces the duration of the hex to 1 round. Once per day when the bouda uses this hex, she can impose two different penalties on the target instead of just one. If the bouda takes the evil eye hex, it increases the number of different penalties she can impose on the hex&#146;s target by 1. At 8th level, the penalties imposed by this hex increase to &#150;4.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>These strange and often solitary witches have a strong connection to curses, the evil eye, and hyenas.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: Because of the dark nature of her magic, a bouda must be of an evil alignment. If a character with the bouda archetype ceases to be evil, she loses the ability to use all alternate class features granted by this archetype (but still retains all other witch class features), though she&#146;s still considered to be a bouda when taking further levels in the witch class. A bouda regains use of all archetype alternate class features if she atones for her violations (see the atonement spell on page 245 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</b></p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Witch's class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Witches are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a witch&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list. A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a witch&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;10. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which spells to prepare.</p>
			<p><b>Bouda&#146;s Eye (Su): </b>A bouda&#146;s gaze can bestow ill fortune on her enemies. This hex can affect a creature within 30 feet that the bouda can see. The target takes a &#150;2 penalty on one of the following (bouda&#146;s choice): AC, ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, or skill checks. The hex lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the bouda&#146;s Intelligence modifier. A successful Will saving throw reduces the duration of the hex to 1 round. Once per day when the bouda uses this hex, she can impose two different penalties on the target instead of just one. If the bouda takes the evil eye hex, it increases the number of different penalties she can impose on the hex&#146;s target by 1. At 8th level, the penalties imposed by this hex increase to &#150;4. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p>This hex must be taken as a bouda&#146;s 1st-level hex, and only a bouda can take this hex.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 2&#150;10 under &#147;Spells per Day.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.</p>
			<p><b>Fetish: </b>A bouda keeps a small fetish: sometimes a carved idol, other times a necklace adorned with teeth or bones. A bouda&#146;s spells come from the will of evil spirits residing in the fetish, and its ability to hold spells functions in a manner identical to the way a witch&#146;s spells are granted by her familiar. The bouda must commune with her fetish each day to prepare her spells and can only prepare spells stored in the fetish.</p>
			<p>At 3rd level, a bouda can use her fetish to deliver touch spells a number of times per day equal to 1/4 her witch level (minimum 1). When casting a touch spell, as a free action she can use this ability. When she does, she can deliver her spell as a ranged touch spell within a range of 30 feet. At 10th level, she can deliver these spells within a range of 60 feet. At 15th level and higher, she can deliver these spells within a range of 90 feet.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the familiar class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Patron: </b>At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch&#146;s patron adds new spells to a witch&#146;s list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to decide.</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a witch gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex as noted on Table 2&#150;10. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.</p>

			<p><b>Hyena Shape (Su): </b>At 10th level, a bouda gains the ability to turn into a hyena or dire hyena and back again a number of times per day equal to her Intelligence modifier. This ability functions as beast shape II, except for the following. The effect lasts for 1 hour per witch level, or until the bouda changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. At 20th level, a bouda can change her form at will. If a bouda dies while in hyena shape, she does not revert back to her true form.</p>
			<p>The bouda does not lose the ability to speak while in animal form, and can communicate with hyenas and dire hyenas as if under the effects of speak with animals. Furthermore, while in this form, the bouda gains the benefit of the Natural Spell feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the major hex granted at 10th level.</p>
			<p><b>Major Hex: </b>Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<p><b>Grand Hex: </b>Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

					<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells.

A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>While all witches are intimately tied to their familiars, a beast-bonded witch&#146;s craft focuses specifically on her familiar bond and developing the relationship with her patron through her familiar.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Witch's class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 2&#150;10 under &#147;Spells per Day.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 1st level, a witch gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex at 2nd level and for every 2 levels attained after 2nd level, as noted on Table 2&#150;10. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch&#146;s level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Patron: </b>At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch&#146;s patron adds new spells to a witch&#146;s list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to decide.</p>
			<p><b>Transfer Feats (Ex): </b>Whenever the beast-bonded witch is capable of learning a new feat, she may choose to instead have her familiar learn the feat as a bonus feat. The familiar must meet the prerequisites for any feats that it learns this way. If her familiar is lost or dies, the witch can reclaim the feat slots and select new feats for herself, or apply the slots toward her new familiar.</p>
			<p><b>Witch&#146;s Familiar (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
			<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>
			<p><b>Enhanced Familiar (Su): </b>At 4th level, the beast-bonded witch&#146;s connection with her familiar strengthens. For the purposes of determining her familiar&#146;s powers and abilities, she treats her familiar as if she were one level higher than her actual witch level. This ability replaces the witch&#146;s 4th-level hex.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Form (Sp): </b>At 8th level, a beast-bonded witch may take the shape of her familiar (or a giant version of her familiar or a similar kind of animal) as if using beast shape II. For example, a witch with a rat familiar can turn into a Tiny rat, Small dire rat, or a larger rodent; one with a cat familiar can turn into a Tiny cat or a Large feline such as a tiger or lion; one with a monkey familiar can turn into a Tiny monkey or a Large gorilla, and so on. The witch can remain in animal form for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. This ability replaces the witch&#146;s 8th-level hex.</p>
			<p><b>Major Hex: </b>Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<p><b>Twin Soul (Su): </b>At 10th-level, if the witch or her familiar is gravely injured or about to die, the soul of the dying one immediately transfers to the other&#146;s body. The two souls share the surviving body peaceably, can communicate freely, and both retain their ability to think and reason. The host may allow the guest soul to take over the body temporarily or reclaim it as a move action. They can persist in this state indefinitely, or the guest can return to its own body (if available) by touch, transfer into a suitable vessel (such as a clone), or take over another body as if using magic jar (with no receptacle). This replaces the witch&#146;s major hex at 10th-level.</p>
			<p><b>Grand Hex: </b>Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

				<name type="string">Bonded Item</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a bonded witch gains a bonded item instead of a familiar. This bonded item is similar to a wizard&#146;s arcane bond bonded item, and follows all the rules of such an item with the following exceptions.</p>
					<p>A bonded witch&#146;s bonded item serves as a vessel for her spells and a conduit for communication with her patron. A bonded witch must commune with her bonded item each day to prepare her spells. The bonded item stores all of the spells that the bonded witch knows, and the bonded witch cannot prepare spells that are not stored within it. A bonded witch starts with the same number of spells and gains new spells the same way as a witch, and can even add spells by learning them from scrolls in the same way, but a bonded witch cannot learn spells from another bonded item.</p>
					<p>Since a bonded witch does not have a spellbook, starting at 2nd level, a bonded witch&#146;s bonded item can be used once per day to cast a spell dependent on the type of bonded object chosen by the bonded witch. The spell is treated like any other spell cast by the bonded witch, including its casting time, duration, and other effects dependent of the bonded witch&#146;s level. This spell cannot be further modified by metamagic feats or any other ability. As the bonded witch gains levels, the bonded item gains new spells that the bonded witch can cast in this way. She can cast any one of these spells once per day using her bonded object, but gains greater flexibility in what spells she can cast, and gains more powerful spells as she gains new levels. The bonded item spells associated with each item type are as follows.</p>
					<p>Amulet: 2nd&#151;stone fist; 4th&#151;bear&#146;s endurance; 6th&#151;burst of speed; 8th&#151;mnemonic enhancer; 10th&#151;stoneskin; 12th&#151;monstrous physique IV; 14th&#151;firebrand; 16th&#151;iron body; 18th&#151;overwhelming presence.</p>

					<p>Weapon: 2nd&#151;warding weapon; 4th&#151;versatile weapon; 6th&#151;greater magic weapon; 8th&#151;telekinetic charge; 10th&#151;energy siege shot; 12th&#151;blade barrier; 14th&#151;arcane cannon; 16th&#151;earthquake; 18th&#151;ride the lightning.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>While all witches commune with the unknown, the blend of human ingenuity and adept learning mixed with elven blood gives some half-elves a unique conduit to channel the powers of the arcane. Bonded witches forsake familiars as vessels of power in favor of a specific object that grants them powers above and beyond those of their patron alone, as they tap into the powerful magic of the item itself. A bonded witch has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Witch's class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Witches are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a witch&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list. A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a witch&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;10. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which spells to prepare.</p>
			<p><b>Bonded Item (Sp): </b>At 1st level, a bonded witch gains a bonded item instead of a familiar. This bonded item is similar to a wizard&#146;s arcane bond bonded item, and follows all the rules of such an item with the following exceptions.</p>
			<p>A bonded witch&#146;s bonded item serves as a vessel for her spells and a conduit for communication with her patron. A bonded witch must commune with her bonded item each day to prepare her spells. The bonded item stores all of the spells that the bonded witch knows, and the bonded witch cannot prepare spells that are not stored within it. A bonded witch starts with the same number of spells and gains new spells the same way as a witch, and can even add spells by learning them from scrolls in the same way, but a bonded witch cannot learn spells from another bonded item.</p>
			<p>Since a bonded witch does not have a spellbook, starting at 2nd level, a bonded witch&#146;s bonded item can be used once per day to cast a spell dependent on the type of bonded object chosen by the bonded witch. The spell is treated like any other spell cast by the bonded witch, including its casting time, duration, and other effects dependent of the bonded witch&#146;s level. This spell cannot be further modified by metamagic feats or any other ability. As the bonded witch gains levels, the bonded item gains new spells that the bonded witch can cast in this way. She can cast any one of these spells once per day using her bonded object, but gains greater flexibility in what spells she can cast, and gains more powerful spells as she gains new levels. The bonded item spells associated with each item type are as follows.</p>
			<p><i>Amulet: </i>2nd&#151;stone fist; 4th&#151;bear&#146;s endurance; 6th&#151;burst of speed; 8th&#151;mnemonic enhancer; 10th&#151;stoneskin; 12th&#151;monstrous physique IV; 14th&#151;firebrand; 16th&#151;iron body; 18th&#151;overwhelming presence.</p>
			<p><i>Ring: </i>2nd&#151;shield; 4th&#151;ablative barrier; 6th&#151;protection from energy; 8th&#151;nondetection; 10th&#151;life bubble; 12th&#151;resinous skin; 14th&#151;antimagic field; 16th&#151;deflection; 18th&#151;spell immunity.</p>
			<p><i>Staff: </i>2nd&#151;shillelagh; 4th&#151;warp wood; 6th&#151;plant growth; 8th&#151;arboreal hammer; 10th&#151;passwall; 12th&#151;move earth; 14th&#151;changestaff; 16th&#151;control plants; 18th&#151;wooden phalanx.</p>
			<p><i>Wand: </i>2nd&#151;magic missile; 4th&#151;knock; 6th&#151;fireball; 8th&#151;restoration; 10th&#151;maximized scorching ray; 12th&#151;bull&#146;s strength (mass); 14th&#151;greater restoration; 16th&#151;empowered and maximized fireball; 18th&#151;empowered and maximized fire shield.</p>
			<p><i>Weapon: </i>2nd&#151;warding weapon; 4th&#151;versatile weapon; 6th&#151;greater magic weapon; 8th&#151;telekinetic charge; 10th&#151;energy siege shot; 12th&#151;blade barrier; 14th&#151;arcane cannon; 16th&#151;earthquake; 18th&#151;ride the lightning.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the witch&#146;s familiar class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 2&#150;10 under &#147;Spells per Day.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 1st level, a witch gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex at 2nd level and for every 2 levels attained after 2nd level, as noted on Table 2&#150;10. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch&#146;s level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Patron: </b>At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch&#146;s patron adds new spells to a witch&#146;s list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to decide.</p>
			<p><b>Major Hex: </b>Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<p><b>Grand Hex: </b>Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Qadira&#146;s armies strike terror into foes, but tales of something even more terrible than desert dervishes or charging cavalry haunt foot soldiers serving Qadira&#146;s neighbors. Known in Taldane as a &#147;battle witch,&#148; an ashiftah drifts like a phantom among the enemy armies, calling down disaster upon their heads and weakening their resolve. Qadiran ashiftahs usually go veiled, and even their cohorts in the Imperial Forces superstitiously believe that seeing their faces brings misfortune.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Witches are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a witch&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list. A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a witch&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;10. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which spells to prepare.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 2&#150;10 under &#147;Spells per Day.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 1st level, a witch gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex at 2nd level and for every 2 levels attained after 2nd level, as noted on Table 2&#150;10. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch&#146;s level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Patron: </b>At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch&#146;s patron adds new spells to a witch&#146;s list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to decide.</p>
			<p><b>Protecting Veil: </b>An ashiftah&#146;s veil is not merely a uniform, but a magical vestment imbued with power. Its ability to hold spells functions identically to a witch&#146;s familiar. An ashiftah must veil herself and commune with her patron each day to prepare her spells and cannot prepare spells not stored in the veil.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces familiar.</p>
			<p><b>Ghostwalk (Su): </b>Starting at 2nd level, as a move action after using a hex, an ashiftah can become invisible as per vanishAPG and can then take a 5-foot step. Using ghostwalk doesn&#146;t provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the hex gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </b>Starting at 3rd level, an ashiftah can use her veil to deliver touch spells. After casting a touch spell, as a full-round action, she can tear a strip from her veil and whisper to it, designating a target. She then releases the scrap of fabric, which drifts on the wind to the target and delivers the spell as a ranged touch attack. The target must be within 20 feet of the witch. The veil mends itself after the spell is delivered.</p>
			<p><b>Fog of War (Sp): </b>At 6th level, as a standard action, an ashiftah can blanket a 20-foot-radius area of the battlefield in a clammy mist that functions as per barrow hazeACG, allowing her to treat any area within the mist as within 30 feet for purposes of her hexes, as long as some part of that area is within 30 feet of her.</p>
			<p>This replaces the hex gained at 6th level.</p>
			<p><b>Major Hex: </b>Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<p><b>Grand Hex: </b>Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>

					<p>An alley witch builds a special rapport with a single city. At 1st level, she can select one settlement whose type is large town size or larger. Within this settlement, she gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks, as well as Knowledge (local), Perception, Stealth, and Sense Motive checks. At 6th level and every 5 witch levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 2. The alley witch can build a rapport with a new city after 30 days of remaining there; this severs her bond to her previous settlement. This ability replaces the witch&#146;s 1st-level hex.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
					<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>

					<p>At 6th level, once per day as a full-round action, an alley witch can bind a hex she knows into a feather, bead, or other small token. Any creature holding this token can use that hex once as if using a potion, targeting itself or a creature it touches. While a hex is sealed into a token, the alley witch loses her ability to use that hex until the token is used or she can recover the token. If a hex can be used in increments (like the disguise hex), the alley witch decides how many increments the token contains when making it. If a hex has no set duration, it lasts for 1 minute once activated. This ability replaces the witch&#146;s 6th-level hex.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some witches find their spark of magic in the long, dark shadows and forgotten places within the city.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be or where its true purposes lie.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witches&#146; spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Witch's class skills are Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Witches are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a witch&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list. A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time.</p>
			<p>To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a witch&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;10. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the witch decides which spells to prepare.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 2&#150;10 under &#147;Spells per Day.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for example, are expended normally.</p>
			<p><b>Crowd Patron: </b>An alley witch draws power not from a patron, but from the crowd of minds around her. She doesn&#146;t select a patron at 1st level; instead, she gains the following bonus spells at the listed levels.</p>
			<p>2nd&#151;ears of the city (see page 30), 4th&#151;alter self, 6th&#151;witnessUM, 8th&#151;shadow stepUM, 10th&#151;mage&#146;s private sanctum, 12th&#151;heroes&#146; feast, 14th&#151;limited wish, 16th&#151;create demiplaneUM, 18th&#151;shades.</p>
			<p>This ability alters witch&#146;s familiar.</p>
			<p><b>Hex: </b>Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 1st level, a witch gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex at 2nd level and for every 2 levels attained after 2nd level, as noted on Table 2&#150;10. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch&#146;s level + the witch&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Patron: </b>At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch&#146;s patron adds new spells to a witch&#146;s list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to decide.</p>
			<p><b>Speak to the City: </b>An alley witch builds a special rapport with a single city. At 1st level, she can select one settlement whose type is large town size or larger. Within this settlement, she gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks, as well as Knowledge (local), Perception, Stealth, and Sense Motive checks. At 6th level and every 5 witch levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 2. The alley witch can build a rapport with a new city after 30 days of remaining there; this severs her bond to her previous settlement. This ability replaces the witch&#146;s 1st-level hex.</p>
			<p><b>Witch&#146;s Familiar (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard&#146;s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch&#146;s Familiar section.</p>
			<p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch&#146;s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch&#146;s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).</p>
			<p><b>Hex Trader: </b>At 6th level, once per day as a full-round action, an alley witch can bind a hex she knows into a feather, bead, or other small token. Any creature holding this token can use that hex once as if using a potion, targeting itself or a creature it touches. While a hex is sealed into a token, the alley witch loses her ability to use that hex until the token is used or she can recover the token. If a hex can be used in increments (like the disguise hex), the alley witch decides how many increments the token contains when making it. If a hex has no set duration, it lasts for 1 minute once activated. This ability replaces the witch&#146;s 6th-level hex.</p>
			<p><b>Major Hex: </b>Starting at 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<p><b>Grand Hex: </b>Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could select a new hex.</p>
			<h>Adding Spells to a Witch&#146;s Familiar</h>
			<p>Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those spells belong to the witch&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Spells Gained at a New Level: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar Teaching Familiar: </b>A witch&#146;s familiar can learn spells from another witch&#146;s familiar. To accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to another, subject to GM discretion.</p>
			<p><b>Learn from a Scroll: </b>A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is still consumed.</p>
