					<p>While he may adventure with evil or neutral allies, an antipaladin avoids working with good characters or with anyone who consistently attempts to do good deeds. Under exceptional circumstances, an antipaladin can ally with good associates, but only to defeat them from within and bring ruin to their ranks. An antipaladin does not need an atonement spell during such an unusual alliance as long as his nefarious goals are met in the end-evil cares only about results. An antipaladin may accept only henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are chaotic evil.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>An antipaladin must be of chaotic evil alignment and loses all class features except proficiencies if he willingly and altruistically commits good acts. This does not mean that an antipaladin cannot take actions someone else might qualify as good, only that such actions must always be in service of his own dark ends. An antipaladin's code requires that he place his own interests and desires above all else, as well as impose tyranny, take advantage whenever possible, and punish the good and just, provided such actions don't interfere with his goals.</p>

				<name type="string">Fiendish Servant</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>The second type of bond allows an antipaladin to gain the service of a fiendish servant. This functions as <i>summon monster III </i>, except the duration is permanent and the antipaladin can only gain the service of a single creature and that creature must either have the chaotic and evil subtypes or it must be a fiendish animal. Once selected, the choice is set, but it may be changed whenever the antipaladin gains a level. Upon reaching 7th level, and every two levels thereafter, the level of the <i>summon monster </i>spell increases by one, to a maximum of <i>summon monster IX </i>at 17th level. Once per day, as a full-round action, an antipaladin may magically call his servant to his side. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the antipaladin's level. The servant immediately appears adjacent to the antipaladin. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels thereafter, for a total of four times per day at 17th level. At 11th level, the servant gains the advanced template (see the <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary </i>). At 15th level, an antipaladin's servant gains spell resistance equal to the antipaladin's level + 11. Should the antipaladin's fiendish servant die or be banished, the antipaladin may not summon another servant for 30 days or until he gains an antipaladin level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>The first type of bond allows the antipaladin to enhance his weapon as a standard action by calling upon the aid of a fiendish spirit for 1 minute per antipaladin level. When called, the spirit causes the weapon to shed unholy light as a torch. At 5th level, this spirit grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: <i>anarchic </i>, <i>flaming </i>, <i>flaming burst </i>, <i>keen </i>, <i>speed </i>, <i>unholy </i>, <i>vicious </i>, <i>vorpal </i>, and <i>wounding </i>. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table 15-9 in the <i>Core Rulebook </i>). These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The fiendish spirit imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than the antipaladin but resumes giving bonuses if returned to the antipaladin. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level. If a weapon bonded with a fiendish spirit is destroyed, the antipaladin loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until he gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, an antipaladin can select one cruelty. Each cruelty adds an effect to the antipaladin's touch of corruption ability. Whenever the antipaladin uses touch of corruption to deal damage to one target, the target also receives the additional effect from one of the cruelties possessed by the antipaladin. This choice is made when the touch is used. The target receives a Fortitude save to avoid this cruelty. If the save is successful, the target takes the damage as normal, but not the effects of the cruelty. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the antipaladin's level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. At 3rd level, the antipaladin can select from the following initial cruelties.</p>

						<li><i>Shaken </i>: The target is shaken for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>

						<li><i>Dazed </i>: The target is dazed for 1 round.</li>
						<li><i>Diseased </i>: The target contracts a disease, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>contagion </i>, using his antipaladin level as his caster level.</li>

						<li><i>Exhausted </i>: The target is exhausted. The antipaladin must have the fatigue cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
						<li><i>Frightened </i>: The target is frightened for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the shaken cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>

					<p>At will, an antipaladin can use <i>detect good </i>, as the spell. An antipaladin can, as a move action, concentrate on a single item or individual within 60 feet and determine if it is good, learning the strength of its aura as if having studied it for 3 rounds. While focusing on one individual or object, the antipaladin does not detect good in any other object or individual within range.</p>

					<p>Once per day, an antipaladin can call out to the dark powers to crush the forces of good. As a swift action, the antipaladin chooses one target within sight to smite.

					<p>Beginning at 4th level, an antipaladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells which are drawn from the antipaladin spell list presented in Chapter 5. An antipaladin must choose and prepare his spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, an antipaladin must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an antipaladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, an antipaladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is the same as that of a paladin and is given on Table 2-13. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-3 in the Core Rulebook). When Table 2-13 indicates that the antipaladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level. An antipaladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. An antipaladin may prepare and cast any spell on the antipaladin spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation. Through 3rd level, an antipaladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his antipaladin level -3.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>-</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although it is a rare occurrence, paladins do sometimes stray from the path of righteousness. Most of these wayward holy warriors seek out redemption and forgiveness for their misdeeds, regaining their powers through piety, charity, and powerful magic. Yet there are others, the dark and disturbed few, who turn actively to evil, courting the dark powers they once railed against in order to take vengeance on their former brothers. It's said that those who climb the farthest have the farthest to fall, and antipaladins are living proof of this fact, their pride and hatred blinding them to the glory of their forsaken patrons.</p>
			<p>Antipaladins become the antithesis of their former selves. They make pacts with fiends, take the lives of the innocent, and put nothing ahead of their personal power and wealth. Champions of evil, they often lead armies of evil creatures and work with other villains to bring ruin to the holy and tyranny to the weak. Not surprisingly, paladins stop at nothing to put an end to such nefarious antiheroes.</p>
			<p>The antipaladin is an alternate class. Making use of and altering numerous facets of the paladin core class, this villainous warrior can't truly be considered a new character class by its own right. By the changes made here, though, the details and tones of the paladin class are shifted in a completely opposite direction and captures an entirely different fantasy theme, without needlessly designing an entire new class. While a redesign of sorts, this alternate class can be used just as any of the other base classes found in the first part of this chapter.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: Antipaladins are villains at their most dangerous. They care nothing for the lives of others and actively seek to bring death and destruction to ordered society. They rarely travel with those that they do not subjugate, unless as part of a ruse to bring ruin from within.</p>
			<p>As an alternate paladin class, the antipaladin uses Table: Antipaladin to determine its base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, and spells per day. These details, along with the class's new special abilities, can be found on Table 2-13.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Chaotic evil.</p>
			<h>Ex-Antipaladins</h>
			<p>A antipaladin who ceases to be chaotic evil, who willfully commits an good act, or who violates the code of conduct loses all antipaladin spells and class features (including the fiendish boon, but not weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). He may not progress any further in levels as an antipaladin. He regains his abilities and advancement potential if he atones for his violations (see the <i>atonement </i>spell), as appropriate.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Antipaladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Evil (Ex) </b>: The power of an antipaladin's aura of evil (see the <i>detect evil </i>spell) is equal to his antipaladin level. A paladin who uses smite evil on an antipaladin deals 2 points of damage per paladin level on his first successful attack.</p>
			<p><b>Detect Good (Sp) </b>: At will, an antipaladin can use <i>detect good </i>, as the spell. An antipaladin can, as a move action, concentrate on a single item or individual within 60 feet and determine if it is good, learning the strength of its aura as if having studied it for 3 rounds. While focusing on one individual or object, the antipaladin does not detect good in any other object or individual within range.</p>
			<p><b>Smite Good (Su) </b>: Once per day, an antipaladin can call out to the dark powers to crush the forces of good. As a swift action, the antipaladin chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is good, the antipaladin adds his Charisma bonus (if any) on his attack rolls and adds his antipaladin level on all damage rolls made against the target of his smite. If the target of smite good is an outsider with the good subtype, a good-aligned dragon, or a good creature with levels of cleric or paladin, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per level the antipaladin possesses. Regardless of the target, smite good attacks automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess.</p>
			<p>In addition, while smite good is in effect, the antipaladin gains a deflection bonus equal to his Charisma modifier (if any) to his AC against attacks made by the target of the smite. If the antipaladin targets a creature that is not good, the smite is wasted with no effect.</p>
			<p>The smite good effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time the antipaladin rests and regains his uses of this ability. At 4th level, and at every three levels thereafter, the antipaladin may smite good one additional time per day, as indicated on Table 2-13, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Unholy Resilience (Su) </b>: At 2nd level, an antipaladin gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Touch of Corruption (Su) </b>: Beginning at 2nd level, an antipaladin surrounds his hand with a fiendish flame, causing terrible wounds to open on those he touches. Each day he can use this ability a number of times equal to 1/2 his antipaladin level + his Charisma modifier. As a touch attack, an antipaladin can cause 1d6 points of damage for every two antipaladin levels he possesses. Using this ability is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
			<p>Alternatively, an antipaladin can use this power to heal undead creatures, restoring 1d6 hit points for every two levels the antipaladin possesses. This ability is modified by any feat, spell, or effect that specifically works with the lay on hands paladin class feature. For example, the Extra Lay On Hands feat grants an antipaladin 2 additional uses of the touch of corruption class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Cowardice (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, an antipaladin radiates a palpably daunting aura that causes all enemies within 10 feet to take a -4 penalty on saving throws against fear effects. Creatures that are normally immune to fear lose that immunity while within 10 feet of an antipaladin with this ability. This ability functions only while the antipaladin remains conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Plague Bringer (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, the powers of darkness make an antipaladin a beacon of corruption and disease. An antipaladin does not take any damage or take any penalty from diseases. He can still contract diseases and spread them to others, but he is otherwise immune to their effects.</p>
			<p><b>Cruelty (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, an antipaladin can select one cruelty. Each cruelty adds an effect to the antipaladin's touch of corruption ability. Whenever the antipaladin uses touch of corruption to deal damage to one target, the target also receives the additional effect from one of the cruelties possessed by the antipaladin. This choice is made when the touch is used. The target receives a Fortitude save to avoid this cruelty. If the save is successful, the target takes the damage as normal, but not the effects of the cruelty. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the antipaladin's level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. At 3rd level, the antipaladin can select from the following initial cruelties.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Fatigued </i>: The target is fatigued.</li>
				<li><i>Shaken </i>: The target is shaken for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Sickened </i>: The target is sickened for 1 round per level of the antipaladin. At 6th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Dazed </i>: The target is dazed for 1 round.</li>
				<li><i>Diseased </i>: The target contracts a disease, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>contagion </i>, using his antipaladin level as his caster level.</li>
				<li><i>Staggered </i>: The target is staggered for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin. At 9th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Cursed </i>: The target is cursed, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>bestow curse </i>, using his antipaladin level as his caster level.</li>
				<li><i>Exhausted </i>: The target is exhausted. The antipaladin must have the fatigue cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Frightened </i>: The target is frightened for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the shaken cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Nauseated </i>: The target is nauseated for 1 round per three levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the sickened cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Poisoned </i>: The target is poisoned, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>poison </i>, using the antipaladin's level as the caster level. At 12th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Blinded </i>: The target is blinded for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Deafened </i>: The target is deafened for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Paralyzed </i>: The target is paralyzed for 1 round.</li>
				<li><i>Stunned </i>: The target is stunned for 1 round per four levels of the antipaladin. These abilities are not cumulative. For example, a 12th-level antipaladin's touch of corruption ability deals 6d6 points of damage and might also cause the target to become fatigued, dazed, poisoned, or diseased. Once a cruelty is chosen, it can't be changed.</li>
			</list>
			<p><b>Channel Negative Energy (Su) </b>: When an antipaladin reaches 4th level, he gains the supernatural ability to channel negative energy like a cleric. Using this ability consumes two uses of his touch of corruption ability. An antipaladin uses his level as his effective cleric level when channeling negative energy. This is a Charisma-based ability.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: Beginning at 4th level, an antipaladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells which are drawn from the antipaladin spell list presented in Chapter 5. An antipaladin must choose and prepare his spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, an antipaladin must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an antipaladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, an antipaladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is the same as that of a paladin and is given on Table 2-13. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-3 in the Core Rulebook). When Table 2-13 indicates that the antipaladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>An antipaladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. An antipaladin may prepare and cast any spell on the antipaladin spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, an antipaladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his antipaladin level -3.</p>
			<p><b>Fiendish Boon (Sp) </b>: Upon reaching 5th level, an antipaladin receives a boon from his dark patrons. This boon can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Bond </b>: The first type of bond allows the antipaladin to enhance his weapon as a standard action by calling upon the aid of a fiendish spirit for 1 minute per antipaladin level. When called, the spirit causes the weapon to shed unholy light as a torch. At 5th level, this spirit grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: <i>anarchic </i>, <i>flaming </i>, <i>flaming burst </i>, <i>keen </i>, <i>speed </i>, <i>unholy </i>, <i>vicious </i>, <i>vorpal </i>, and <i>wounding </i>. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table 15-9 in the <i>Core Rulebook </i>). These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The fiendish spirit imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than the antipaladin but resumes giving bonuses if returned to the antipaladin. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level.</p>
			<p>If a weapon bonded with a fiendish spirit is destroyed, the antipaladin loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until he gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>
			<p><b>Fiendish Servant </b>: The second type of bond allows an antipaladin to gain the service of a fiendish servant. This functions as <i>summon monster III </i>, except the duration is permanent and the antipaladin can only gain the service of a single creature and that creature must either have the chaotic and evil subtypes or it must be a fiendish animal. Once selected, the choice is set, but it may be changed whenever the antipaladin gains a level. Upon reaching 7th level, and every two levels thereafter, the level of the <i>summon monster </i>spell increases by one, to a maximum of <i>summon monster IX </i>at 17th level.</p>
			<p>Once per day, as a full-round action, an antipaladin may magically call his servant to his side. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the antipaladin's level. The servant immediately appears adjacent to the antipaladin. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels thereafter, for a total of four times per day at 17th level.</p>
			<p>At 11th level, the servant gains the advanced template (see the <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary </i>). At 15th level, an antipaladin's servant gains spell resistance equal to the antipaladin's level + 11.</p>
			<p>Should the antipaladin's fiendish servant die or be banished, the antipaladin may not summon another servant for 30 days or until he gains an antipaladin level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Despair (Su) </b>: At 8th level, enemies within 10 feet of an antipaladin take a -2 penalty on all saving throws. This penalty does not stack with the penalty from aura of cowardice.</p>
			<p>This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Vengeance (Su) </b>: At 11th level, an antipaladin can expend two uses of his smite good ability to grant the ability to smite good to all allies within 10 feet, using his bonuses. Allies must use this smite good ability by the start of the antipaladin's next turn and the bonuses last for 1 minute. Using this ability is a free action. Good creatures gain no benefit from this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Sin (Su) </b>: At 14th level, an antipaladin's weapons are treated as evil-aligned for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. Any attack made against an enemy within 10 feet of him is treated as evil-aligned for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Depravity (Su) </b>: At 17th level, an antipaladin gains DR 5/good. Each enemy within 10 feet takes a -4 penalty on saving throws against compulsion effects. This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Unholy Champion (Su) </b>: At 20th level, an antipaladin becomes a conduit for the might of the dark powers. His DR increases to 10/good. Whenever he uses smite good and successfully strikes an good outsider, the outsider is also subject to a <i>banishment </i>, using his antipaladin level as the caster level (his weapon and unholy symbol automatically count as objects that the subject hates). After the <i>banishment </i>effect and the damage from the attack is resolved, the smite immediately ends. In addition, whenever he channels negative energy or uses touch of corruption to damage a creature, he deals the maximum possible amount.</p>
			<p><b>Code of Conduct </b>: An antipaladin must be of chaotic evil alignment and loses all class features except proficiencies if he willingly and altruistically commits good acts. This does not mean that an antipaladin cannot take actions someone else might qualify as good, only that such actions must always be in service of his own dark ends. An antipaladin's code requires that he place his own interests and desires above all else, as well as impose tyranny, take advantage whenever possible, and punish the good and just, provided such actions don't interfere with his goals.</p>
			<p><b>Associates </b>: While he may adventure with evil or neutral allies, an antipaladin avoids working with good characters or with anyone who consistently attempts to do good deeds. Under exceptional circumstances, an antipaladin can ally with good associates, but only to defeat them from within and bring ruin to their ranks. An antipaladin does not need an atonement spell during such an unusual alliance as long as his nefarious goals are met in the end-evil cares only about results. An antipaladin may accept only henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are chaotic evil.</p>

					<p>Beginning at 4th level, an antipaladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells which are drawn from the antipaladin spell list presented in Chapter 5. An antipaladin must choose and prepare his spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, an antipaladin must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an antipaladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, an antipaladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is the same as that of a paladin and is given on Table 2-13. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-3 in the Core Rulebook). When Table 2-13 indicates that the antipaladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level. An antipaladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. An antipaladin may prepare and cast any spell on the antipaladin spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation. Through 3rd level, an antipaladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his antipaladin level -3.</p>

As a touch attack, an antipaladin can cause 1d6 points of damage for every two antipaladin levels he possesses. Using this ability is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Alternatively, an antipaladin can use this power to heal undead creatures, restoring 1d6 hit points for every two levels the antipaladin possesses. This ability is modified by any feat, spell, or effect that specifically works with the lay on hands paladin class feature. For example, the Extra Lay On Hands feat grants an antipaladin 2 additional uses of the touch of corruption class feature.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Evil arises in every form imaginable, not just in hearts full of destruction and chaos. Tyrants are manipulative and lawful antipaladins, chess masters who arrange things behind the scenes to ensure that whatever happens, evil always wins, and the tyrant along with it. Unlike other antipaladins, tyrants are all too happy to associate with good creatures, the better to manipulate them into performing evil acts.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although it is a rare occurrence, paladins do sometimes stray from the path of righteousness. Most of these wayward holy warriors seek out redemption and forgiveness for their misdeeds, regaining their powers through piety, charity, and powerful magic. Yet there are others, the dark and disturbed few, who turn actively to evil, courting the dark powers they once railed against in order to take vengeance on their former brothers. It's said that those who climb the farthest have the farthest to fall, and antipaladins are living proof of this fact, their pride and hatred blinding them to the glory of their forsaken patrons.</p>
			<p>Antipaladins become the antithesis of their former selves. They make pacts with fiends, take the lives of the innocent, and put nothing ahead of their personal power and wealth. Champions of evil, they often lead armies of evil creatures and work with other villains to bring ruin to the holy and tyranny to the weak. Not surprisingly, paladins stop at nothing to put an end to such nefarious antiheroes.</p>
			<p>The antipaladin is an alternate class. Making use of and altering numerous facets of the paladin core class, this villainous warrior can't truly be considered a new character class by its own right. By the changes made here, though, the details and tones of the paladin class are shifted in a completely opposite direction and captures an entirely different fantasy theme, without needlessly designing an entire new class. While a redesign of sorts, this alternate class can be used just as any of the other base classes found in the first part of this chapter.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: Antipaladins are villains at their most dangerous. They care nothing for the lives of others and actively seek to bring death and destruction to ordered society. They rarely travel with those that they do not subjugate, unless as part of a ruse to bring ruin from within.</p>
			<p>As an alternate paladin class, the antipaladin uses Table: Antipaladin to determine its base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, and spells per day. These details, along with the class's new special abilities, can be found on Table 2-13.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Chaotic evil.</p>
			<h>Ex-Antipaladins</h>
			<p>A antipaladin who ceases to be chaotic evil, who willfully commits an good act, or who violates the code of conduct loses all antipaladin spells and class features (including the fiendish boon, but not weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). He may not progress any further in levels as an antipaladin. He regains his abilities and advancement potential if he atones for his violations (see the <i>atonement </i>spell), as appropriate.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Tyrant&#146;s Code: </b>A tyrant must be of lawful evil alignment and loses all class features except proficiencies if he willingly and altruistically commits good acts. This does not mean the tyrant can&#146;t take actions someone else might qualify as good, only that such actions must always be in service of his own dark ambitions. A tyrant&#146;s code requires that he place his own sinister goals above all else, respect rightful authority even as he twists its loopholes to his own ends, impose tyranny, and punish all those who dare dissent. A tyrant can accept underlings of any alignment; he cares not who serves him, only that they are truly loyal to him. He can even work alongside good-aligned individuals, as long as he is secretly manipulating them.</p>
			<p>This alters the antipaladin&#146;s code of conduct and associated abilities, as well as the section on ex-antipaladins.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Antipaladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Evil (Ex) </b>: The power of an antipaladin's aura of evil (see the <i>detect evil </i>spell) is equal to his antipaladin level. A paladin who uses smite evil on an antipaladin deals 2 points of damage per paladin level on his first successful attack.</p>
			<p><b>Detect Good (Sp) </b>: At will, an antipaladin can use <i>detect good </i>, as the spell. An antipaladin can, as a move action, concentrate on a single item or individual within 60 feet and determine if it is good, learning the strength of its aura as if having studied it for 3 rounds. While focusing on one individual or object, the antipaladin does not detect good in any other object or individual within range.</p>
			<p><b>Smite Good (Su) </b>: Once per day, an antipaladin can call out to the dark powers to crush the forces of good. As a swift action, the antipaladin chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is good, the antipaladin adds his Charisma bonus (if any) on his attack rolls and adds his antipaladin level on all damage rolls made against the target of his smite. If the target of smite good is an outsider with the good subtype, a good-aligned dragon, or a good creature with levels of cleric or paladin, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per level the antipaladin possesses. Regardless of the target, smite good attacks automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess.</p>
			<p>In addition, while smite good is in effect, the antipaladin gains a deflection bonus equal to his Charisma modifier (if any) to his AC against attacks made by the target of the smite. If the antipaladin targets a creature that is not good, the smite is wasted with no effect.</p>
			<p>The smite good effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time the antipaladin rests and regains his uses of this ability. At 4th level, and at every three levels thereafter, the antipaladin may smite good one additional time per day, as indicated on Table 2-13, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Unholy Resilience (Su) </b>: At 2nd level, an antipaladin gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Touch of Corruption (Su) </b>: Beginning at 2nd level, an antipaladin surrounds his hand with a fiendish flame, causing terrible wounds to open on those he touches. Each day he can use this ability a number of times equal to 1/2 his antipaladin level + his Charisma modifier. As a touch attack, an antipaladin can cause 1d6 points of damage for every two antipaladin levels he possesses. Using this ability is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
			<p>Alternatively, an antipaladin can use this power to heal undead creatures, restoring 1d6 hit points for every two levels the antipaladin possesses. This ability is modified by any feat, spell, or effect that specifically works with the lay on hands paladin class feature. For example, the Extra Lay On Hands feat grants an antipaladin 2 additional uses of the touch of corruption class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Cowardice (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, an antipaladin radiates a palpably daunting aura that causes all enemies within 10 feet to take a -4 penalty on saving throws against fear effects. Creatures that are normally immune to fear lose that immunity while within 10 feet of an antipaladin with this ability. This ability functions only while the antipaladin remains conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Plague Bringer (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, the powers of darkness make an antipaladin a beacon of corruption and disease. An antipaladin does not take any damage or take any penalty from diseases. He can still contract diseases and spread them to others, but he is otherwise immune to their effects.</p>
			<p><b>Cruelty (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, an antipaladin can select one cruelty. Each cruelty adds an effect to the antipaladin's touch of corruption ability. Whenever the antipaladin uses touch of corruption to deal damage to one target, the target also receives the additional effect from one of the cruelties possessed by the antipaladin. This choice is made when the touch is used. The target receives a Fortitude save to avoid this cruelty. If the save is successful, the target takes the damage as normal, but not the effects of the cruelty. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the antipaladin's level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. At 3rd level, the antipaladin can select from the following initial cruelties.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Fatigued </i>: The target is fatigued.</li>
				<li><i>Shaken </i>: The target is shaken for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Sickened </i>: The target is sickened for 1 round per level of the antipaladin. At 6th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Dazed </i>: The target is dazed for 1 round.</li>
				<li><i>Diseased </i>: The target contracts a disease, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>contagion </i>, using his antipaladin level as his caster level.</li>
				<li><i>Staggered </i>: The target is staggered for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin. At 9th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Cursed </i>: The target is cursed, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>bestow curse </i>, using his antipaladin level as his caster level.</li>
				<li><i>Exhausted </i>: The target is exhausted. The antipaladin must have the fatigue cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Frightened </i>: The target is frightened for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the shaken cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Nauseated </i>: The target is nauseated for 1 round per three levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the sickened cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Poisoned </i>: The target is poisoned, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>poison </i>, using the antipaladin's level as the caster level. At 12th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Blinded </i>: The target is blinded for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Deafened </i>: The target is deafened for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Paralyzed </i>: The target is paralyzed for 1 round.</li>
				<li><i>Stunned </i>: The target is stunned for 1 round per four levels of the antipaladin. These abilities are not cumulative. For example, a 12th-level antipaladin's touch of corruption ability deals 6d6 points of damage and might also cause the target to become fatigued, dazed, poisoned, or diseased. Once a cruelty is chosen, it can't be changed.</li>
			</list>
			<p><b>Channel Negative Energy (Su) </b>: When an antipaladin reaches 4th level, he gains the supernatural ability to channel negative energy like a cleric. Using this ability consumes two uses of his touch of corruption ability. An antipaladin uses his level as his effective cleric level when channeling negative energy. This is a Charisma-based ability.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: Beginning at 4th level, an antipaladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells which are drawn from the antipaladin spell list presented in Chapter 5. An antipaladin must choose and prepare his spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, an antipaladin must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an antipaladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, an antipaladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is the same as that of a paladin and is given on Table 2-13. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-3 in the Core Rulebook). When Table 2-13 indicates that the antipaladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>An antipaladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. An antipaladin may prepare and cast any spell on the antipaladin spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, an antipaladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his antipaladin level -3.</p>
			<p><b>Diabolic Boon (Sp): </b>At 5th level, if a tyrant chooses to gain the services of a fiendish servant with his fiendish boon ability, he must choose a fiendish animal or a creature with the lawful and evil subtypes.</p>
			<p>This ability alters fiendish boon..</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Bond </b>: The first type of bond allows the antipaladin to enhance his weapon as a standard action by calling upon the aid of a fiendish spirit for 1 minute per antipaladin level. When called, the spirit causes the weapon to shed unholy light as a torch. At 5th level, this spirit grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: <i>anarchic </i>, <i>flaming </i>, <i>flaming burst </i>, <i>keen </i>, <i>speed </i>, <i>unholy </i>, <i>vicious </i>, <i>vorpal </i>, and <i>wounding </i>. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table 15-9 in the <i>Core Rulebook </i>). These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The fiendish spirit imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than the antipaladin but resumes giving bonuses if returned to the antipaladin. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level.</p>
			<p>If a weapon bonded with a fiendish spirit is destroyed, the antipaladin loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until he gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>
			<p><b>Fiendish Servant </b>: The second type of bond allows an antipaladin to gain the service of a fiendish servant. This functions as <i>summon monster III </i>, except the duration is permanent and the antipaladin can only gain the service of a single creature and that creature must either have the chaotic and evil subtypes or it must be a fiendish animal. Once selected, the choice is set, but it may be changed whenever the antipaladin gains a level. Upon reaching 7th level, and every two levels thereafter, the level of the <i>summon monster </i>spell increases by one, to a maximum of <i>summon monster IX </i>at 17th level.</p>
			<p>Once per day, as a full-round action, an antipaladin may magically call his servant to his side. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the antipaladin's level. The servant immediately appears adjacent to the antipaladin. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels thereafter, for a total of four times per day at 17th level.</p>
			<p>At 11th level, the servant gains the advanced template (see the <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary </i>). At 15th level, an antipaladin's servant gains spell resistance equal to the antipaladin's level + 11.</p>
			<p>Should the antipaladin's fiendish servant die or be banished, the antipaladin may not summon another servant for 30 days or until he gains an antipaladin level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Despair (Su) </b>: At 8th level, enemies within 10 feet of an antipaladin take a -2 penalty on all saving throws. This penalty does not stack with the penalty from aura of cowardice.</p>
			<p>This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Vengeance (Su) </b>: At 11th level, an antipaladin can expend two uses of his smite good ability to grant the ability to smite good to all allies within 10 feet, using his bonuses. Allies must use this smite good ability by the start of the antipaladin's next turn and the bonuses last for 1 minute. Using this ability is a free action. Good creatures gain no benefit from this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Sin (Su) </b>: At 14th level, an antipaladin's weapons are treated as evil-aligned for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. Any attack made against an enemy within 10 feet of him is treated as evil-aligned for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Depravity (Su) </b>: At 17th level, an antipaladin gains DR 5/good. Each enemy within 10 feet takes a -4 penalty on saving throws against compulsion effects. This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Unholy Champion (Su) </b>: At 20th level, an antipaladin becomes a conduit for the might of the dark powers. His DR increases to 10/good. Whenever he uses smite good and successfully strikes an good outsider, the outsider is also subject to a <i>banishment </i>, using his antipaladin level as the caster level (his weapon and unholy symbol automatically count as objects that the subject hates). After the <i>banishment </i>effect and the damage from the attack is resolved, the smite immediately ends. In addition, whenever he channels negative energy or uses touch of corruption to damage a creature, he deals the maximum possible amount.</p>
			<p><b>Code of Conduct </b>: An antipaladin must be of chaotic evil alignment and loses all class features except proficiencies if he willingly and altruistically commits good acts. This does not mean that an antipaladin cannot take actions someone else might qualify as good, only that such actions must always be in service of his own dark ends. An antipaladin's code requires that he place his own interests and desires above all else, as well as impose tyranny, take advantage whenever possible, and punish the good and just, provided such actions don't interfere with his goals.</p>
			<p><b>Associates </b>: While he may adventure with evil or neutral allies, an antipaladin avoids working with good characters or with anyone who consistently attempts to do good deeds. Under exceptional circumstances, an antipaladin can ally with good associates, but only to defeat them from within and bring ruin to their ranks. An antipaladin does not need an atonement spell during such an unusual alliance as long as his nefarious goals are met in the end-evil cares only about results. An antipaladin may accept only henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are chaotic evil.</p>

For every three levels beyond 5th, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: <i>anarchic </i>, <i>flaming </i>, <i>flaming burst </i>, <i>keen </i>, <i>speed </i>, <i>unholy </i>, <i>vicious </i>, <i>vorpal </i>, and <i>wounding </i>. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table 15-9 in the <i>Core Rulebook </i>). These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The fiendish spirit imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than the antipaladin but resumes giving bonuses if returned to the antipaladin. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level. If a weapon bonded with a fiendish spirit is destroyed, the antipaladin loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until he gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>

					<p>Beginning at 4th level, an antipaladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells which are drawn from the antipaladin spell list presented in Chapter 5. An antipaladin must choose and prepare his spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, an antipaladin must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an antipaladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, an antipaladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is the same as that of a paladin and is given on Table 2-13. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-3 in the Core Rulebook). When Table 2-13 indicates that the antipaladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level. An antipaladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. An antipaladin may prepare and cast any spell on the antipaladin spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation. Through 3rd level, an antipaladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his antipaladin level -3.</p>

					<p>Beginning at 2nd level, an antipaladin surrounds his hand with a fiendish flame, causing terrible wounds to open on those he touches. Each day he can use this ability a number of times equal to 1/2 his antipaladin level + his Charisma modifier. As a touch attack, an antipaladin can cause 1d6 points of damage for every two antipaladin levels he possesses. Using this ability is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Alternatively, an antipaladin can use this power to heal undead creatures, restoring 1d6 hit points for every two levels the antipaladin possesses. This ability is modified by any feat, spell, or effect that specifically works with the lay on hands paladin class feature. For example, the Extra Lay On Hands feat grants an antipaladin 2 additional uses of the touch of corruption class feature.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Seal-breakers are dedicated to the Whispering Tyrant and have tasked themselves with finding and destroying the seals that bind him within Gallowspire. Their ties to the Whispering Tyrant give them power over undead creatures and other dark forces.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although it is a rare occurrence, paladins do sometimes stray from the path of righteousness. Most of these wayward holy warriors seek out redemption and forgiveness for their misdeeds, regaining their powers through piety, charity, and powerful magic. Yet there are others, the dark and disturbed few, who turn actively to evil, courting the dark powers they once railed against in order to take vengeance on their former brothers. It's said that those who climb the farthest have the farthest to fall, and antipaladins are living proof of this fact, their pride and hatred blinding them to the glory of their forsaken patrons.</p>
			<p>Antipaladins become the antithesis of their former selves. They make pacts with fiends, take the lives of the innocent, and put nothing ahead of their personal power and wealth. Champions of evil, they often lead armies of evil creatures and work with other villains to bring ruin to the holy and tyranny to the weak. Not surprisingly, paladins stop at nothing to put an end to such nefarious antiheroes.</p>
			<p>The antipaladin is an alternate class. Making use of and altering numerous facets of the paladin core class, this villainous warrior can't truly be considered a new character class by its own right. By the changes made here, though, the details and tones of the paladin class are shifted in a completely opposite direction and captures an entirely different fantasy theme, without needlessly designing an entire new class. While a redesign of sorts, this alternate class can be used just as any of the other base classes found in the first part of this chapter.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: Antipaladins are villains at their most dangerous. They care nothing for the lives of others and actively seek to bring death and destruction to ordered society. They rarely travel with those that they do not subjugate, unless as part of a ruse to bring ruin from within.</p>
			<p>As an alternate paladin class, the antipaladin uses Table: Antipaladin to determine its base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, and spells per day. These details, along with the class's new special abilities, can be found on Table 2-13.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Chaotic evil.</p>
			<h>Ex-Antipaladins</h>
			<p>A antipaladin who ceases to be chaotic evil, who willfully commits an good act, or who violates the code of conduct loses all antipaladin spells and class features (including the fiendish boon, but not weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). He may not progress any further in levels as an antipaladin. He regains his abilities and advancement potential if he atones for his violations (see the <i>atonement </i>spell), as appropriate.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Antipaladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Evil (Ex) </b>: The power of an antipaladin's aura of evil (see the <i>detect evil </i>spell) is equal to his antipaladin level. A paladin who uses smite evil on an antipaladin deals 2 points of damage per paladin level on his first successful attack.</p>
			<p><b>Detect Good (Sp) </b>: At will, an antipaladin can use <i>detect good </i>, as the spell. An antipaladin can, as a move action, concentrate on a single item or individual within 60 feet and determine if it is good, learning the strength of its aura as if having studied it for 3 rounds. While focusing on one individual or object, the antipaladin does not detect good in any other object or individual within range.</p>
			<p><b>Smite Good (Su) </b>: Once per day, an antipaladin can call out to the dark powers to crush the forces of good. As a swift action, the antipaladin chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is good, the antipaladin adds his Charisma bonus (if any) on his attack rolls and adds his antipaladin level on all damage rolls made against the target of his smite. If the target of smite good is an outsider with the good subtype, a good-aligned dragon, or a good creature with levels of cleric or paladin, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per level the antipaladin possesses. Regardless of the target, smite good attacks automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess.</p>
			<p>In addition, while smite good is in effect, the antipaladin gains a deflection bonus equal to his Charisma modifier (if any) to his AC against attacks made by the target of the smite. If the antipaladin targets a creature that is not good, the smite is wasted with no effect.</p>
			<p>The smite good effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time the antipaladin rests and regains his uses of this ability. At 4th level, and at every three levels thereafter, the antipaladin may smite good one additional time per day, as indicated on Table 2-13, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Unholy Resilience (Su) </b>: At 2nd level, an antipaladin gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Touch of Corruption (Su) </b>: Beginning at 2nd level, an antipaladin surrounds his hand with a fiendish flame, causing terrible wounds to open on those he touches. Each day he can use this ability a number of times equal to 1/2 his antipaladin level + his Charisma modifier. As a touch attack, an antipaladin can cause 1d6 points of damage for every two antipaladin levels he possesses. Using this ability is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
			<p>Alternatively, an antipaladin can use this power to heal undead creatures, restoring 1d6 hit points for every two levels the antipaladin possesses. This ability is modified by any feat, spell, or effect that specifically works with the lay on hands paladin class feature. For example, the Extra Lay On Hands feat grants an antipaladin 2 additional uses of the touch of corruption class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of the Grave (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a seal-breaker is constantly surrounded by the chill of death. Mindless undead within 10 feet of the seal-breaker will not attack him unless directly ordered to, and even then only after succeeding at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the seal-breaker&#146;s level + his Charisma modifier). This ability replaces aura of cowardice.</p>
			<p><b>Plague Bringer (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, the powers of darkness make an antipaladin a beacon of corruption and disease. An antipaladin does not take any damage or take any penalty from diseases. He can still contract diseases and spread them to others, but he is otherwise immune to their effects.</p>
			<p><b>Cruelty (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, an antipaladin can select one cruelty. Each cruelty adds an effect to the antipaladin's touch of corruption ability. Whenever the antipaladin uses touch of corruption to deal damage to one target, the target also receives the additional effect from one of the cruelties possessed by the antipaladin. This choice is made when the touch is used. The target receives a Fortitude save to avoid this cruelty. If the save is successful, the target takes the damage as normal, but not the effects of the cruelty. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the antipaladin's level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. At 3rd level, the antipaladin can select from the following initial cruelties.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Fatigued </i>: The target is fatigued.</li>
				<li><i>Shaken </i>: The target is shaken for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Sickened </i>: The target is sickened for 1 round per level of the antipaladin. At 6th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Dazed </i>: The target is dazed for 1 round.</li>
				<li><i>Diseased </i>: The target contracts a disease, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>contagion </i>, using his antipaladin level as his caster level.</li>
				<li><i>Staggered </i>: The target is staggered for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin. At 9th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Cursed </i>: The target is cursed, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>bestow curse </i>, using his antipaladin level as his caster level.</li>
				<li><i>Exhausted </i>: The target is exhausted. The antipaladin must have the fatigue cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Frightened </i>: The target is frightened for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the shaken cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Nauseated </i>: The target is nauseated for 1 round per three levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the sickened cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Poisoned </i>: The target is poisoned, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>poison </i>, using the antipaladin's level as the caster level. At 12th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Blinded </i>: The target is blinded for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Deafened </i>: The target is deafened for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Paralyzed </i>: The target is paralyzed for 1 round.</li>
				<li><i>Stunned </i>: The target is stunned for 1 round per four levels of the antipaladin. These abilities are not cumulative. For example, a 12th-level antipaladin's touch of corruption ability deals 6d6 points of damage and might also cause the target to become fatigued, dazed, poisoned, or diseased. Once a cruelty is chosen, it can't be changed.</li>
			</list>
			<p><b>Channel Negative Energy (Su) </b>: When an antipaladin reaches 4th level, he gains the supernatural ability to channel negative energy like a cleric. Using this ability consumes two uses of his touch of corruption ability. An antipaladin uses his level as his effective cleric level when channeling negative energy. This is a Charisma-based ability.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: Beginning at 4th level, an antipaladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells which are drawn from the antipaladin spell list presented in Chapter 5. An antipaladin must choose and prepare his spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, an antipaladin must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an antipaladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, an antipaladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is the same as that of a paladin and is given on Table 2-13. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-3 in the Core Rulebook). When Table 2-13 indicates that the antipaladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>An antipaladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. An antipaladin may prepare and cast any spell on the antipaladin spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, an antipaladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his antipaladin level -3.</p>
			<p><b>Corpse Rider (Su): </b>Upon reaching 5th level, a sealbreaker receives a boon from beyond the grave. This boon can take one of two forms: the seal-breaker can choose to form a bond with his weapon, or he can choose to animate an undead mount to ride.</p>
			<p>If a bonded weapon is selected, this ability works exactly like the antipaladin&#146;s fiendish boon ability.</p>
			<p>If the undead mount ability is selected, the sealbreaker gains the ability to reanimate any Large corpse (or a Medium corpse for Small seal-breakers) as his corpse mount. If no such corpse is present, the seal-breaker cannot summon his mount. The corpse animates as a quadruped of the same size that the seal-breaker can ride, regardless of the corpse&#146;s living form. This corpse mount functions as a druid&#146;s animal companion using the seal-breaker&#146;s level as his effective druid level. The mount has the same base statistics as a heavy horse, pony, boar, camel, or dog (based on its size) with the following changes: its type changes to undead, it has a good Will save and bad Fortitude and Reflex saves, it uses the base creature&#146;s Constitution score as its Charisma score (and likewise applies all level-based advancements to Charisma instead of Constitution), and it has an Intelligence score of at least 6. This ability otherwise functions as and replaces fiendish boon.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Death (Su): </b>At 8th level, a seal-breaker radiates an aura that causes undead creatures within 10 feet to gain a +2 profane bonus on all saving throws. This ability replaces aura of despair.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Rebirth (Su): </b>At 11th level, if a living creature is slain within 10 feet of the seal-breaker, the seal-breaker can spend two uses of his smite good ability at the start of his next turn as a standard action to summon the spirit of a dead murderer to reanimate the corpse as a mohrg. The mohrg immediately rises and attacks the seal breaker&#146;s foes, acting under the antipaladin&#146;s command. After 1 minute, the murderer&#146;s soul leaves the body, which collapses, again lifeless. At 15th level, the seal-breaker can activate this ability as a move action. At 19th level, he can activate this ability as a swift action. This ability replaces aura of vengeance.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Sin (Su) </b>: At 14th level, an antipaladin's weapons are treated as evil-aligned for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. Any attack made against an enemy within 10 feet of him is treated as evil-aligned for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Depravity (Su) </b>: At 17th level, an antipaladin gains DR 5/good. Each enemy within 10 feet takes a -4 penalty on saving throws against compulsion effects. This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Unholy Champion (Su) </b>: At 20th level, an antipaladin becomes a conduit for the might of the dark powers. His DR increases to 10/good. Whenever he uses smite good and successfully strikes an good outsider, the outsider is also subject to a <i>banishment </i>, using his antipaladin level as the caster level (his weapon and unholy symbol automatically count as objects that the subject hates). After the <i>banishment </i>effect and the damage from the attack is resolved, the smite immediately ends. In addition, whenever he channels negative energy or uses touch of corruption to damage a creature, he deals the maximum possible amount.</p>
			<p><b>Code of Conduct </b>: An antipaladin must be of chaotic evil alignment and loses all class features except proficiencies if he willingly and altruistically commits good acts. This does not mean that an antipaladin cannot take actions someone else might qualify as good, only that such actions must always be in service of his own dark ends. An antipaladin's code requires that he place his own interests and desires above all else, as well as impose tyranny, take advantage whenever possible, and punish the good and just, provided such actions don't interfere with his goals.</p>
			<p><b>Associates </b>: While he may adventure with evil or neutral allies, an antipaladin avoids working with good characters or with anyone who consistently attempts to do good deeds. Under exceptional circumstances, an antipaladin can ally with good associates, but only to defeat them from within and bring ruin to their ranks. An antipaladin does not need an atonement spell during such an unusual alliance as long as his nefarious goals are met in the end-evil cares only about results. An antipaladin may accept only henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are chaotic evil.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>The second type of bond allows an antipaladin to gain the service of a fiendish servant. This functions as <i>summon monster III </i>, except the duration is permanent and the antipaladin can only gain the service of a single creature and that creature must either have the chaotic and evil subtypes or it must be a fiendish animal. Once selected, the choice is set, but it may be changed whenever the antipaladin gains a level. Upon reaching 7th level, and every two levels thereafter, the level of the <i>summon monster </i>spell increases by one, to a maximum of <i>summon monster IX </i>at 17th level. Once per day, as a full-round action, an antipaladin may magically call his servant to his side. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the antipaladin's level. The servant immediately appears adjacent to the antipaladin. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels thereafter, for a total of four times per day at 17th level. At 11th level, the servant gains the advanced template (see the <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary </i>). At 15th level, an antipaladin's servant gains spell resistance equal to the antipaladin's level + 11. Should the antipaladin's fiendish servant die or be banished, the antipaladin may not summon another servant for 30 days or until he gains an antipaladin level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>

				<name type="string">Weapon Bond</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>The first type of bond allows the antipaladin to enhance his weapon as a standard action by calling upon the aid of a fiendish spirit for 1 minute per antipaladin level. When called, the spirit causes the weapon to shed unholy light as a torch. At 5th level, this spirit grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: <i>anarchic </i>, <i>flaming </i>, <i>flaming burst </i>, <i>keen </i>, <i>speed </i>, <i>unholy </i>, <i>vicious </i>, <i>vorpal </i>, and <i>wounding </i>. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table 15-9 in the <i>Core Rulebook </i>). These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The fiendish spirit imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than the antipaladin but resumes giving bonuses if returned to the antipaladin. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level. If a weapon bonded with a fiendish spirit is destroyed, the antipaladin loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until he gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>

					<p>Beginning at 4th level, an antipaladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells which are drawn from the antipaladin spell list presented in Chapter 5. An antipaladin must choose and prepare his spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, an antipaladin must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an antipaladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, an antipaladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is the same as that of a paladin and is given on Table 2-13. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-3 in the Core Rulebook). When Table 2-13 indicates that the antipaladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level. An antipaladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. An antipaladin may prepare and cast any spell on the antipaladin spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation. Through 3rd level, an antipaladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his antipaladin level -3.</p>

As a touch attack, an antipaladin can cause 1d6 points of damage for every two antipaladin levels he possesses. Using this ability is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Alternatively, an antipaladin can use this power to heal undead creatures, restoring 1d6 hit points for every two levels the antipaladin possesses. This ability is modified by any feat, spell, or effect that specifically works with the lay on hands paladin class feature.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Rough rampagers venerate Rovagug, reveling in the destruction the dark god represents. Where others seek power, wealth, or revenge, the rough rampager merely focuses on slaughter and mayhem. Because of their sheer destructive nature, most rough rampagers live short, brutal lives swathed in blood and carnage before someone puts them to the blade. Legends speak of dozens of rough rampagers wreaking havoc when Rovagug&#146;s spawn escape, acting as heralds and harbingers of the greater destruction created by the Rough Beast&#146;s terrifying children.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although it is a rare occurrence, paladins do sometimes stray from the path of righteousness. Most of these wayward holy warriors seek out redemption and forgiveness for their misdeeds, regaining their powers through piety, charity, and powerful magic. Yet there are others, the dark and disturbed few, who turn actively to evil, courting the dark powers they once railed against in order to take vengeance on their former brothers. It's said that those who climb the farthest have the farthest to fall, and antipaladins are living proof of this fact, their pride and hatred blinding them to the glory of their forsaken patrons.</p>
			<p>Antipaladins become the antithesis of their former selves. They make pacts with fiends, take the lives of the innocent, and put nothing ahead of their personal power and wealth. Champions of evil, they often lead armies of evil creatures and work with other villains to bring ruin to the holy and tyranny to the weak. Not surprisingly, paladins stop at nothing to put an end to such nefarious antiheroes.</p>
			<p>The antipaladin is an alternate class. Making use of and altering numerous facets of the paladin core class, this villainous warrior can't truly be considered a new character class by its own right. By the changes made here, though, the details and tones of the paladin class are shifted in a completely opposite direction and captures an entirely different fantasy theme, without needlessly designing an entire new class. While a redesign of sorts, this alternate class can be used just as any of the other base classes found in the first part of this chapter.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: Antipaladins are villains at their most dangerous. They care nothing for the lives of others and actively seek to bring death and destruction to ordered society. They rarely travel with those that they do not subjugate, unless as part of a ruse to bring ruin from within.</p>
			<p>As an alternate paladin class, the antipaladin uses Table: Antipaladin to determine its base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, and spells per day. These details, along with the class's new special abilities, can be found on Table 2-13.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Chaotic evil.</p>
			<h>Ex-Antipaladins</h>
			<p>A antipaladin who ceases to be chaotic evil, who willfully commits an good act, or who violates the code of conduct loses all antipaladin spells and class features (including the fiendish boon, but not weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). He may not progress any further in levels as an antipaladin. He regains his abilities and advancement potential if he atones for his violations (see the <i>atonement </i>spell), as appropriate.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Antipaladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Evil (Ex) </b>: The power of an antipaladin's aura of evil (see the <i>detect evil </i>spell) is equal to his antipaladin level. A paladin who uses smite evil on an antipaladin deals 2 points of damage per paladin level on his first successful attack.</p>
			<p><b>Detect Good (Sp) </b>: At will, an antipaladin can use <i>detect good </i>, as the spell. An antipaladin can, as a move action, concentrate on a single item or individual within 60 feet and determine if it is good, learning the strength of its aura as if having studied it for 3 rounds. While focusing on one individual or object, the antipaladin does not detect good in any other object or individual within range.</p>
			<p><b>Smite Good (Su) </b>: Once per day, an antipaladin can call out to the dark powers to crush the forces of good. As a swift action, the antipaladin chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is good, the antipaladin adds his Charisma bonus (if any) on his attack rolls and adds his antipaladin level on all damage rolls made against the target of his smite. If the target of smite good is an outsider with the good subtype, a good-aligned dragon, or a good creature with levels of cleric or paladin, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per level the antipaladin possesses. Regardless of the target, smite good attacks automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess.</p>
			<p>In addition, while smite good is in effect, the antipaladin gains a deflection bonus equal to his Charisma modifier (if any) to his AC against attacks made by the target of the smite. If the antipaladin targets a creature that is not good, the smite is wasted with no effect.</p>
			<p>The smite good effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time the antipaladin rests and regains his uses of this ability. At 4th level, and at every three levels thereafter, the antipaladin may smite good one additional time per day, as indicated on Table 2-13, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Unholy Resilience (Su) </b>: At 2nd level, an antipaladin gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Touch of Corruption (Su) </b>: Beginning at 2nd level, an antipaladin surrounds his hand with a fiendish flame, causing terrible wounds to open on those he touches. Each day he can use this ability a number of times equal to 1/2 his antipaladin level + his Charisma modifier. As a touch attack, an antipaladin can cause 1d6 points of damage for every two antipaladin levels he possesses. Using this ability is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
			<p>Alternatively, an antipaladin can use this power to heal undead creatures, restoring 1d6 hit points for every two levels the antipaladin possesses. This ability is modified by any feat, spell, or effect that specifically works with the lay on hands paladin class feature. For example, the Extra Lay On Hands feat grants an antipaladin 2 additional uses of the touch of corruption class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Blood (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a rough rampager radiates a palpably daunting aura that causes all enemies within 10 feet to take a &#150;4 penalty on Constitution or Heal checks to stop bleed damage and checks to stabilize while dying. This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious. This ability replaces aura of cowardice.</p>
			<p><b>Plague Bringer (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, the powers of darkness make an antipaladin a beacon of corruption and disease. An antipaladin does not take any damage or take any penalty from diseases. He can still contract diseases and spread them to others, but he is otherwise immune to their effects.</p>
			<p><b>Cruelty (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, an antipaladin can select one cruelty. Each cruelty adds an effect to the antipaladin's touch of corruption ability. Whenever the antipaladin uses touch of corruption to deal damage to one target, the target also receives the additional effect from one of the cruelties possessed by the antipaladin. This choice is made when the touch is used. The target receives a Fortitude save to avoid this cruelty. If the save is successful, the target takes the damage as normal, but not the effects of the cruelty. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the antipaladin's level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. At 3rd level, the antipaladin can select from the following initial cruelties.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Fatigued </i>: The target is fatigued.</li>
				<li><i>Shaken </i>: The target is shaken for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Sickened </i>: The target is sickened for 1 round per level of the antipaladin. At 6th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Dazed </i>: The target is dazed for 1 round.</li>
				<li><i>Diseased </i>: The target contracts a disease, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>contagion </i>, using his antipaladin level as his caster level.</li>
				<li><i>Staggered </i>: The target is staggered for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin. At 9th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Cursed </i>: The target is cursed, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>bestow curse </i>, using his antipaladin level as his caster level.</li>
				<li><i>Exhausted </i>: The target is exhausted. The antipaladin must have the fatigue cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Frightened </i>: The target is frightened for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the shaken cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Nauseated </i>: The target is nauseated for 1 round per three levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the sickened cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Poisoned </i>: The target is poisoned, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>poison </i>, using the antipaladin's level as the caster level. At 12th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Blinded </i>: The target is blinded for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Deafened </i>: The target is deafened for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Paralyzed </i>: The target is paralyzed for 1 round.</li>
				<li><i>Stunned </i>: The target is stunned for 1 round per four levels of the antipaladin. These abilities are not cumulative. For example, a 12th-level antipaladin's touch of corruption ability deals 6d6 points of damage and might also cause the target to become fatigued, dazed, poisoned, or diseased. Once a cruelty is chosen, it can't be changed.</li>
			</list>
			<p><b>Channel Negative Energy (Su) </b>: When an antipaladin reaches 4th level, he gains the supernatural ability to channel negative energy like a cleric. Using this ability consumes two uses of his touch of corruption ability. An antipaladin uses his level as his effective cleric level when channeling negative energy. This is a Charisma-based ability.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: Beginning at 4th level, an antipaladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells which are drawn from the antipaladin spell list presented in Chapter 5. An antipaladin must choose and prepare his spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, an antipaladin must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an antipaladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, an antipaladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is the same as that of a paladin and is given on Table 2-13. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-3 in the Core Rulebook). When Table 2-13 indicates that the antipaladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>An antipaladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. An antipaladin may prepare and cast any spell on the antipaladin spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, an antipaladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his antipaladin level -3.</p>
			<p><b>Fiendish Boon (Sp) </b>: Upon reaching 5th level, an antipaladin receives a boon from his dark patrons. This boon can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Bond </b>: The first type of bond allows the antipaladin to enhance his weapon as a standard action by calling upon the aid of a fiendish spirit for 1 minute per antipaladin level. When called, the spirit causes the weapon to shed unholy light as a torch. At 5th level, this spirit grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: <i>anarchic </i>, <i>flaming </i>, <i>flaming burst </i>, <i>keen </i>, <i>speed </i>, <i>unholy </i>, <i>vicious </i>, <i>vorpal </i>, and <i>wounding </i>. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table 15-9 in the <i>Core Rulebook </i>). These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The fiendish spirit imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than the antipaladin but resumes giving bonuses if returned to the antipaladin. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level.</p>
			<p>If a weapon bonded with a fiendish spirit is destroyed, the antipaladin loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until he gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>
			<p><b>Fiendish Servant </b>: The second type of bond allows an antipaladin to gain the service of a fiendish servant. This functions as <i>summon monster III </i>, except the duration is permanent and the antipaladin can only gain the service of a single creature and that creature must either have the chaotic and evil subtypes or it must be a fiendish animal. Once selected, the choice is set, but it may be changed whenever the antipaladin gains a level. Upon reaching 7th level, and every two levels thereafter, the level of the <i>summon monster </i>spell increases by one, to a maximum of <i>summon monster IX </i>at 17th level.</p>
			<p>Once per day, as a full-round action, an antipaladin may magically call his servant to his side. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the antipaladin's level. The servant immediately appears adjacent to the antipaladin. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels thereafter, for a total of four times per day at 17th level.</p>
			<p>At 11th level, the servant gains the advanced template (see the <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary </i>). At 15th level, an antipaladin's servant gains spell resistance equal to the antipaladin's level + 11.</p>
			<p>Should the antipaladin's fiendish servant die or be banished, the antipaladin may not summon another servant for 30 days or until he gains an antipaladin level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Putrefaction (Su): </b>At 8th level, a rough rampager radiates an aura that causes the wounds of enemies within 10 feet to weep blood. Injured enemies in the area take 1 point of bleed damage per round. This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious. This ability replaces aura of despair.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Vengeance (Su) </b>: At 11th level, an antipaladin can expend two uses of his smite good ability to grant the ability to smite good to all allies within 10 feet, using his bonuses. Allies must use this smite good ability by the start of the antipaladin's next turn and the bonuses last for 1 minute. Using this ability is a free action. Good creatures gain no benefit from this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Quietus (Su): </b>At 14th level, a rough rampager radiates an aura that causes the failure of healing spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities used to restore enemies within 10 feet of him. This is not an antimagic field, however, and ongoing or passive effects are not affected. Casters can overcome this ability with a successful caster level check versus the rough rampager&#146;s class level + 11. This ability replaces aura of sin.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Depravity (Su) </b>: At 17th level, an antipaladin gains DR 5/good. Each enemy within 10 feet takes a -4 penalty on saving throws against compulsion effects. This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Unholy Champion (Su) </b>: At 20th level, an antipaladin becomes a conduit for the might of the dark powers. His DR increases to 10/good. Whenever he uses smite good and successfully strikes an good outsider, the outsider is also subject to a <i>banishment </i>, using his antipaladin level as the caster level (his weapon and unholy symbol automatically count as objects that the subject hates). After the <i>banishment </i>effect and the damage from the attack is resolved, the smite immediately ends. In addition, whenever he channels negative energy or uses touch of corruption to damage a creature, he deals the maximum possible amount.</p>
			<p><b>Code of Conduct </b>: An antipaladin must be of chaotic evil alignment and loses all class features except proficiencies if he willingly and altruistically commits good acts. This does not mean that an antipaladin cannot take actions someone else might qualify as good, only that such actions must always be in service of his own dark ends. An antipaladin's code requires that he place his own interests and desires above all else, as well as impose tyranny, take advantage whenever possible, and punish the good and just, provided such actions don't interfere with his goals.</p>
			<p><b>Associates </b>: While he may adventure with evil or neutral allies, an antipaladin avoids working with good characters or with anyone who consistently attempts to do good deeds. Under exceptional circumstances, an antipaladin can ally with good associates, but only to defeat them from within and bring ruin to their ranks. An antipaladin does not need an atonement spell during such an unusual alliance as long as his nefarious goals are met in the end-evil cares only about results. An antipaladin may accept only henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are chaotic evil.</p>

An antipaladin must choose and prepare his spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, an antipaladin must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an antipaladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, an antipaladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is the same as that of a paladin and is given on Table 2-13. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-3 in the Core Rulebook). When Table 2-13 indicates that the antipaladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level. An antipaladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. An antipaladin may prepare and cast any spell on the antipaladin spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation. Through 3rd level, an antipaladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his antipaladin level -3.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Not content with the antipaladin&#146;s mere corruption of the soul, the knight of the sepulcher sacrifices mortality along with morality.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although it is a rare occurrence, paladins do sometimes stray from the path of righteousness. Most of these wayward holy warriors seek out redemption and forgiveness for their misdeeds, regaining their powers through piety, charity, and powerful magic. Yet there are others, the dark and disturbed few, who turn actively to evil, courting the dark powers they once railed against in order to take vengeance on their former brothers. It's said that those who climb the farthest have the farthest to fall, and antipaladins are living proof of this fact, their pride and hatred blinding them to the glory of their forsaken patrons.</p>
			<p>Antipaladins become the antithesis of their former selves. They make pacts with fiends, take the lives of the innocent, and put nothing ahead of their personal power and wealth. Champions of evil, they often lead armies of evil creatures and work with other villains to bring ruin to the holy and tyranny to the weak. Not surprisingly, paladins stop at nothing to put an end to such nefarious antiheroes.</p>
			<p>The antipaladin is an alternate class. Making use of and altering numerous facets of the paladin core class, this villainous warrior can't truly be considered a new character class by its own right. By the changes made here, though, the details and tones of the paladin class are shifted in a completely opposite direction and captures an entirely different fantasy theme, without needlessly designing an entire new class. While a redesign of sorts, this alternate class can be used just as any of the other base classes found in the first part of this chapter.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: Antipaladins are villains at their most dangerous. They care nothing for the lives of others and actively seek to bring death and destruction to ordered society. They rarely travel with those that they do not subjugate, unless as part of a ruse to bring ruin from within.</p>
			<p>As an alternate paladin class, the antipaladin uses Table: Antipaladin to determine its base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, and spells per day. These details, along with the class's new special abilities, can be found on Table 2-13.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Chaotic evil.</p>
			<h>Ex-Antipaladins</h>
			<p>A antipaladin who ceases to be chaotic evil, who willfully commits an good act, or who violates the code of conduct loses all antipaladin spells and class features (including the fiendish boon, but not weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). He may not progress any further in levels as an antipaladin. He regains his abilities and advancement potential if he atones for his violations (see the <i>atonement </i>spell), as appropriate.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Antipaladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Evil (Ex) </b>: The power of an antipaladin's aura of evil (see the <i>detect evil </i>spell) is equal to his antipaladin level. A paladin who uses smite evil on an antipaladin deals 2 points of damage per paladin level on his first successful attack.</p>
			<p><b>Detect Good (Sp) </b>: At will, an antipaladin can use <i>detect good </i>, as the spell. An antipaladin can, as a move action, concentrate on a single item or individual within 60 feet and determine if it is good, learning the strength of its aura as if having studied it for 3 rounds. While focusing on one individual or object, the antipaladin does not detect good in any other object or individual within range.</p>
			<p><b>Smite Good (Su) </b>: Once per day, an antipaladin can call out to the dark powers to crush the forces of good. As a swift action, the antipaladin chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is good, the antipaladin adds his Charisma bonus (if any) on his attack rolls and adds his antipaladin level on all damage rolls made against the target of his smite. If the target of smite good is an outsider with the good subtype, a good-aligned dragon, or a good creature with levels of cleric or paladin, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per level the antipaladin possesses. Regardless of the target, smite good attacks automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess.</p>
			<p>In addition, while smite good is in effect, the antipaladin gains a deflection bonus equal to his Charisma modifier (if any) to his AC against attacks made by the target of the smite. If the antipaladin targets a creature that is not good, the smite is wasted with no effect.</p>
			<p>The smite good effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time the antipaladin rests and regains his uses of this ability. At 4th level, and at every three levels thereafter, the antipaladin may smite good one additional time per day, as indicated on Table 2-13, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Unholy Resilience (Su) </b>: At 2nd level, an antipaladin gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Touch of Corruption (Su) </b>: Beginning at 2nd level, an antipaladin surrounds his hand with a fiendish flame, causing terrible wounds to open on those he touches. Each day he can use this ability a number of times equal to 1/2 his antipaladin level + his Charisma modifier. As a touch attack, an antipaladin can cause 1d6 points of damage for every two antipaladin levels he possesses. Using this ability is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
			<p>Alternatively, an antipaladin can use this power to heal undead creatures, restoring 1d6 hit points for every two levels the antipaladin possesses. This ability is modified by any feat, spell, or effect that specifically works with the lay on hands paladin class feature. For example, the Extra Lay On Hands feat grants an antipaladin 2 additional uses of the touch of corruption class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Cowardice (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, an antipaladin radiates a palpably daunting aura that causes all enemies within 10 feet to take a -4 penalty on saving throws against fear effects. Creatures that are normally immune to fear lose that immunity while within 10 feet of an antipaladin with this ability. This ability functions only while the antipaladin remains conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Plague Bringer (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, the powers of darkness make an antipaladin a beacon of corruption and disease. An antipaladin does not take any damage or take any penalty from diseases. He can still contract diseases and spread them to others, but he is otherwise immune to their effects.</p>
			<p><b>Cruelty (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, an antipaladin can select one cruelty. Each cruelty adds an effect to the antipaladin's touch of corruption ability. Whenever the antipaladin uses touch of corruption to deal damage to one target, the target also receives the additional effect from one of the cruelties possessed by the antipaladin. This choice is made when the touch is used. The target receives a Fortitude save to avoid this cruelty. If the save is successful, the target takes the damage as normal, but not the effects of the cruelty. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the antipaladin's level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. At 3rd level, the antipaladin can select from the following initial cruelties.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Fatigued </i>: The target is fatigued.</li>
				<li><i>Shaken </i>: The target is shaken for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Sickened </i>: The target is sickened for 1 round per level of the antipaladin. At 6th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Dazed </i>: The target is dazed for 1 round.</li>
				<li><i>Diseased </i>: The target contracts a disease, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>contagion </i>, using his antipaladin level as his caster level.</li>
				<li><i>Staggered </i>: The target is staggered for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin. At 9th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Cursed </i>: The target is cursed, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>bestow curse </i>, using his antipaladin level as his caster level.</li>
				<li><i>Exhausted </i>: The target is exhausted. The antipaladin must have the fatigue cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Frightened </i>: The target is frightened for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the shaken cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Nauseated </i>: The target is nauseated for 1 round per three levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the sickened cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Poisoned </i>: The target is poisoned, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>poison </i>, using the antipaladin's level as the caster level. At 12th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Blinded </i>: The target is blinded for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Deafened </i>: The target is deafened for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Paralyzed </i>: The target is paralyzed for 1 round.</li>
				<li><i>Stunned </i>: The target is stunned for 1 round per four levels of the antipaladin. These abilities are not cumulative. For example, a 12th-level antipaladin's touch of corruption ability deals 6d6 points of damage and might also cause the target to become fatigued, dazed, poisoned, or diseased. Once a cruelty is chosen, it can't be changed.</li>
			</list>
			<p><b>Channel Negative Energy (Su) </b>: When an antipaladin reaches 4th level, he gains the supernatural ability to channel negative energy like a cleric. Using this ability consumes two uses of his touch of corruption ability. An antipaladin uses his level as his effective cleric level when channeling negative energy. This is a Charisma-based ability.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: Beginning at 4th level, an antipaladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells which are drawn from the antipaladin spell list presented in Chapter 5. An antipaladin must choose and prepare his spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, an antipaladin must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an antipaladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, an antipaladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is the same as that of a paladin and is given on Table 2-13. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-3 in the Core Rulebook). When Table 2-13 indicates that the antipaladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>An antipaladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. An antipaladin may prepare and cast any spell on the antipaladin spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, an antipaladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his antipaladin level -3.</p>
			<p><b>Touch of the Crypt (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a knight of the sepulcher gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects, death effects, and poison. He is harmed by positive energy effects and healed by negative energy effects as though he were undead, although negative energy effects that don&#146;t heal undead (such as enervation) affect him normally. The knight of the sepulcher has a 25% chance of ignoring critical hits and the bonus damage from sneak attacks as though he were wearing armor of light fortification. This ability replaces the fiendish boon ability.</p>
			<p><b>Fortitude of the Crypt (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a knight of the sepulcher gains immunity to poison. He also gains darkvision 60 feet if he does not already possess it. This ability replaces the aura of despair ability.</p>
			<p><b>Cloak of the Crypt (Ex): </b>At 10th level, the knight of the sepulcher gains immunity to energy drain and harmful negative energy effects. His chance of ignoring critical hits and sneak attacks increases to 50%, as though he were wearing armor of moderate fortification. This ability replaces the smite good use gained at 10th level.</p>
			<p><b>Will of the Crypt (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a knight of the sepulcher&#146;s bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects and death effects increases to +4. This ability replaces the aura of vengeance ability.</p>
			<p><b>Weapons of Sin (Su): </b>At 14th level, a knight of the sepulcher&#146;s weapons are treated as evil-aligned for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. This ability replaces aura of sin.</p>
			<p><b>Crypt Lord (Ex): </b>At 15th level, a knight of the sepulcher&#146;s chance of ignoring critical hits and sneak attacks increases to 75%, as though he were wearing armor of heavy fortification. He gains immunity to death effects, paralysis, sleep effects, and stunning. He no longer sleeps. The knight of the sepulcher also gains immunity to effects that cause fatigue, and effects that would cause him to become exhausted instead cause him to become fatigued. This ability replaces cruelty.</p>
			<p><b>Soul of the Crypt (Su): </b>At 17th level, a knight of the sepulcher gains DR 5/bludgeoning and good. This ability replaces aura of depravity.</p>
			<p><b>Undying Champion (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a knight of the sepulcher joins the ranks of the undead. His DR increases to 10/bludgeoning and good. His type changes to undead, and he acquires all undead traits. Although immune to disease, he can still carry and spread diseases with the antipaladin&#146;s plague bringer ability. The undying champion no longer has a Constitution score. He uses his Charisma score for calculating hit points, Fortitude saves, and any special abilities that rely on Constitution. This ability replaces unholy champion.</p>
			<p><b>Code of Conduct </b>: An antipaladin must be of chaotic evil alignment and loses all class features except proficiencies if he willingly and altruistically commits good acts. This does not mean that an antipaladin cannot take actions someone else might qualify as good, only that such actions must always be in service of his own dark ends. An antipaladin's code requires that he place his own interests and desires above all else, as well as impose tyranny, take advantage whenever possible, and punish the good and just, provided such actions don't interfere with his goals.</p>
			<p><b>Associates </b>: While he may adventure with evil or neutral allies, an antipaladin avoids working with good characters or with anyone who consistently attempts to do good deeds. Under exceptional circumstances, an antipaladin can ally with good associates, but only to defeat them from within and bring ruin to their ranks. An antipaladin does not need an atonement spell during such an unusual alliance as long as his nefarious goals are met in the end-evil cares only about results. An antipaladin may accept only henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are chaotic evil.</p>

					<p>The second type of bond allows an antipaladin to gain the service of a fiendish servant. This functions as <i>summon monster III </i>, except the duration is permanent and the antipaladin can only gain the service of a single creature and that creature must either have the chaotic and evil subtypes or it must be a fiendish animal. Once selected, the choice is set, but it may be changed whenever the antipaladin gains a level. Upon reaching 7th level, and every two levels thereafter, the level of the <i>summon monster </i>spell increases by one, to a maximum of <i>summon monster IX </i>at 17th level. Once per day, as a full-round action, an antipaladin may magically call his servant to his side. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the antipaladin's level. The servant immediately appears adjacent to the antipaladin. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels thereafter, for a total of four times per day at 17th level. At 11th level, the servant gains the advanced template (see the <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary </i>). At 15th level, an antipaladin's servant gains spell resistance equal to the antipaladin's level + 11. Should the antipaladin's fiendish servant die or be banished, the antipaladin may not summon another servant for 30 days or until he gains an antipaladin level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>

				<name type="string">Weapon Bond</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>The first type of bond allows the antipaladin to enhance his weapon as a standard action by calling upon the aid of a fiendish spirit for 1 minute per antipaladin level. When called, the spirit causes the weapon to shed unholy light as a torch. At 5th level, this spirit grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: <i>anarchic </i>, <i>flaming </i>, <i>flaming burst </i>, <i>keen </i>, <i>speed </i>, <i>unholy </i>, <i>vicious </i>, <i>vorpal </i>, and <i>wounding </i>. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table 15-9 in the <i>Core Rulebook </i>). These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The fiendish spirit imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than the antipaladin but resumes giving bonuses if returned to the antipaladin. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level. If a weapon bonded with a fiendish spirit is destroyed, the antipaladin loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until he gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>

If the target of smite good is an outsider with the good subtype, a good-aligned dragon, or a good creature with levels of cleric or paladin, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per level the antipaladin possesses. Regardless of the target, smite good attacks automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess. In addition, while smite good is in effect, the antipaladin gains a deflection bonus equal to his Charisma modifier (if any) to his AC against attacks made by the target of the smite. If the antipaladin targets a creature that is not good, the smite is wasted with no effect. The smite good effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time the antipaladin rests and regains his uses of this ability. At 4th level, and at every three levels thereafter, the antipaladin may smite good one additional time per day, as indicated on Table 2-13, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.</p>

					<p>Beginning at 4th level, an antipaladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells which are drawn from the antipaladin spell list presented in Chapter 5. An antipaladin must choose and prepare his spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, an antipaladin must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an antipaladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, an antipaladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is the same as that of a paladin and is given on Table 2-13. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-3 in the Core Rulebook). When Table 2-13 indicates that the antipaladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level. An antipaladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. An antipaladin may prepare and cast any spell on the antipaladin spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation. Through 3rd level, an antipaladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his antipaladin level -3.</p>

					<p>Beginning at 2nd level, an antipaladin surrounds his hand with a fiendish flame, causing terrible wounds to open on those he touches. Each day he can use this ability a number of times equal to 1/2 his antipaladin level + his Charisma modifier. As a touch attack, an antipaladin can cause 1d6 points of damage for every two antipaladin levels he possesses. Using this ability is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Alternatively, an antipaladin can use this power to heal undead creatures, restoring 1d6 hit points for every two levels the antipaladin possesses. This ability is modified by any feat, spell, or effect that specifically works with the lay on hands paladin class feature. For example, the Extra Lay On Hands feat grants an antipaladin 2 additional uses of the touch of corruption class feature.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Covered from head to toe in blackened armor decorated with grotesque shapes and bristling with spikes, iron tyrants make an unmistakable impression on the battlefield. These antipaladins&#146; armor is an outward symbol of their inner power, and they are rarely seen without it. Iron tyrants seek the strength to rule over domains as unfettered despots, and depend on their armor as protection against those they have not yet cowed.</i></p>
			<p><i>Most iron tyrants are orcs or half-orcs who worship the orc deities Lanishra (god of slavery, subjugation, and tyranny) or Varg (god of iron, siege weapons, and warfare). Though rarer, some iron tyrants belong to other races and worship Urazra (giant god of battle, brutality, and strength) or demon lords such as Aldinach (She of the Six Venoms), Angazhan (the Ravenous King), or Izyagna (She of the Sevenfold Swarm).</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although it is a rare occurrence, paladins do sometimes stray from the path of righteousness. Most of these wayward holy warriors seek out redemption and forgiveness for their misdeeds, regaining their powers through piety, charity, and powerful magic. Yet there are others, the dark and disturbed few, who turn actively to evil, courting the dark powers they once railed against in order to take vengeance on their former brothers. It's said that those who climb the farthest have the farthest to fall, and antipaladins are living proof of this fact, their pride and hatred blinding them to the glory of their forsaken patrons.</p>
			<p>Antipaladins become the antithesis of their former selves. They make pacts with fiends, take the lives of the innocent, and put nothing ahead of their personal power and wealth. Champions of evil, they often lead armies of evil creatures and work with other villains to bring ruin to the holy and tyranny to the weak. Not surprisingly, paladins stop at nothing to put an end to such nefarious antiheroes.</p>
			<p>The antipaladin is an alternate class. Making use of and altering numerous facets of the paladin core class, this villainous warrior can't truly be considered a new character class by its own right. By the changes made here, though, the details and tones of the paladin class are shifted in a completely opposite direction and captures an entirely different fantasy theme, without needlessly designing an entire new class. While a redesign of sorts, this alternate class can be used just as any of the other base classes found in the first part of this chapter.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: Antipaladins are villains at their most dangerous. They care nothing for the lives of others and actively seek to bring death and destruction to ordered society. They rarely travel with those that they do not subjugate, unless as part of a ruse to bring ruin from within.</p>
			<p>As an alternate paladin class, the antipaladin uses Table: Antipaladin to determine its base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, and spells per day. These details, along with the class's new special abilities, can be found on Table 2-13.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Chaotic evil.</p>
			<h>Ex-Antipaladins</h>
			<p>A antipaladin who ceases to be chaotic evil, who willfully commits an good act, or who violates the code of conduct loses all antipaladin spells and class features (including the fiendish boon, but not weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). He may not progress any further in levels as an antipaladin. He regains his abilities and advancement potential if he atones for his violations (see the <i>atonement </i>spell), as appropriate.</p>

			</table>
			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Antipaladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Evil (Ex) </b>: The power of an antipaladin's aura of evil (see the <i>detect evil </i>spell) is equal to his antipaladin level. A paladin who uses smite evil on an antipaladin deals 2 points of damage per paladin level on his first successful attack.</p>
			<p><b>Detect Good (Sp) </b>: At will, an antipaladin can use <i>detect good </i>, as the spell. An antipaladin can, as a move action, concentrate on a single item or individual within 60 feet and determine if it is good, learning the strength of its aura as if having studied it for 3 rounds. While focusing on one individual or object, the antipaladin does not detect good in any other object or individual within range.</p>
			<p><b>Smite Good (Su) </b>: Once per day, an antipaladin can call out to the dark powers to crush the forces of good. As a swift action, the antipaladin chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is good, the antipaladin adds his Charisma bonus (if any) on his attack rolls and adds his antipaladin level on all damage rolls made against the target of his smite. If the target of smite good is an outsider with the good subtype, a good-aligned dragon, or a good creature with levels of cleric or paladin, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per level the antipaladin possesses. Regardless of the target, smite good attacks automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess.</p>
			<p>In addition, while smite good is in effect, the antipaladin gains a deflection bonus equal to his Charisma modifier (if any) to his AC against attacks made by the target of the smite. If the antipaladin targets a creature that is not good, the smite is wasted with no effect.</p>
			<p>The smite good effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time the antipaladin rests and regains his uses of this ability. At 4th level, and at every three levels thereafter, the antipaladin may smite good one additional time per day, as indicated on Table 2-13, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Unholy Resilience (Su) </b>: At 2nd level, an antipaladin gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Iron Fist (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, an iron tyrant gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. In addition, whenever the iron tyrant makes a successful attack with a gauntlet, spiked gauntlet, or armor spikes, the weapon damage is based on his level and not the weapon type, as per the warpriest&#146;s sacred weapon ability.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces touch of corruption.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Cowardice (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, an antipaladin radiates a palpably daunting aura that causes all enemies within 10 feet to take a -4 penalty on saving throws against fear effects. Creatures that are normally immune to fear lose that immunity while within 10 feet of an antipaladin with this ability. This ability functions only while the antipaladin remains conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Plague Bringer (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, the powers of darkness make an antipaladin a beacon of corruption and disease. An antipaladin does not take any damage or take any penalty from diseases. He can still contract diseases and spread them to others, but he is otherwise immune to their effects.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feats: </b>At 3rd level and every 3 antipaladin levels thereafter, an iron tyrant gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. This feat must be a combat feat that relates to the iron tyrant&#146;s armor or shield, such as Shield Focus, or one of the armor mastery feats.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces cruelty.</p>
			<p><b>Unstoppable (Ex): </b>At 4th level, when wearing heavy armor, an iron tyrant is not slowed by terrain that halves movement (such as dense rubble, light undergrowth, and shallow bogs). Terrain that has been magically manipulated to impede motion or terrain that reduces movement by more than half still affects him.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces channel negative energy.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: Beginning at 4th level, an antipaladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells which are drawn from the antipaladin spell list presented in Chapter 5. An antipaladin must choose and prepare his spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, an antipaladin must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an antipaladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, an antipaladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is the same as that of a paladin and is given on Table 2-13. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-3 in the Core Rulebook). When Table 2-13 indicates that the antipaladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>An antipaladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. An antipaladin may prepare and cast any spell on the antipaladin spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, an antipaladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his antipaladin level -3.</p>
			<p><b>Fiendish Bond (Su): </b>At 5th level, instead of forming a fiendish bond with his weapon or a servant, an iron tyrant can form a bond with his armor. As a standard action, an iron tyrant can enhance his armor by calling upon a fiendish spirit&#146;s aid. This bond lasts for 1 minute per antipaladin level. When called, the spirit causes the armor to shed unholy light like a torch. At 5th level, the spirit grants the armor a +1 enhancement bonus. For every 3 antipaladin levels beyond 5th, the armor gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses stack with existing armor enhancement bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following armor special abilities: dastard, ghost touch, fortification (heavy, light, or medium), invulnerability, spell resistance (13, 15, 17, or 19). Adding these special abilities consumes an amount of bonus equal to the special ability&#146;s base price modifier. In addition, the iron tyrant can grant his armor the unrighteous special ability at the cost of a +4 bonus. These special abilities are added to any special abilities the armor already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the armor is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other special abilities can be added. The bonus and special abilities granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The fiendish spirit imparts no bonuses if the armor is worn by anyone other than the iron tyrant, but it resumes giving bonuses if the iron tyrant dons the armor again. An iron tyrant can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every 4 levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level.</p>
			<p>If a suit of bonded armor with a fiendish spirit is destroyed, the iron tyrant loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until he gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the iron tyrant takes a &#150;1 penalty on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces fiendish boon.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Despair (Su) </b>: At 8th level, enemies within 10 feet of an antipaladin take a -2 penalty on all saving throws. This penalty does not stack with the penalty from aura of cowardice.</p>
			<p>This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Vengeance (Su) </b>: At 11th level, an antipaladin can expend two uses of his smite good ability to grant the ability to smite good to all allies within 10 feet, using his bonuses. Allies must use this smite good ability by the start of the antipaladin's next turn and the bonuses last for 1 minute. Using this ability is a free action. Good creatures gain no benefit from this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Sin (Su) </b>: At 14th level, an antipaladin's weapons are treated as evil-aligned for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. Any attack made against an enemy within 10 feet of him is treated as evil-aligned for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Depravity (Su) </b>: At 17th level, an antipaladin gains DR 5/good. Each enemy within 10 feet takes a -4 penalty on saving throws against compulsion effects. This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Unholy Champion (Su) </b>: At 20th level, an antipaladin becomes a conduit for the might of the dark powers. His DR increases to 10/good. Whenever he uses smite good and successfully strikes an good outsider, the outsider is also subject to a <i>banishment </i>, using his antipaladin level as the caster level (his weapon and unholy symbol automatically count as objects that the subject hates). After the <i>banishment </i>effect and the damage from the attack is resolved, the smite immediately ends. In addition, whenever he channels negative energy or uses touch of corruption to damage a creature, he deals the maximum possible amount.</p>
			<p><b>Code of Conduct </b>: An antipaladin must be of chaotic evil alignment and loses all class features except proficiencies if he willingly and altruistically commits good acts. This does not mean that an antipaladin cannot take actions someone else might qualify as good, only that such actions must always be in service of his own dark ends. An antipaladin's code requires that he place his own interests and desires above all else, as well as impose tyranny, take advantage whenever possible, and punish the good and just, provided such actions don't interfere with his goals.</p>
			<p><b>Associates </b>: While he may adventure with evil or neutral allies, an antipaladin avoids working with good characters or with anyone who consistently attempts to do good deeds. Under exceptional circumstances, an antipaladin can ally with good associates, but only to defeat them from within and bring ruin to their ranks. An antipaladin does not need an atonement spell during such an unusual alliance as long as his nefarious goals are met in the end-evil cares only about results. An antipaladin may accept only henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are chaotic evil.</p>

					<p>An insinuator must always work toward his own self-interest, enrichment, or glory, and must also abide by the moral strictures of whatever outsider they have chosen to invoke that day (see invocation below).

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>The second type of bond allows an antipaladin to gain the service of a fiendish servant. This functions as <i>summon monster III </i>, except the duration is permanent and the antipaladin can only gain the service of a single creature and that creature must either have the chaotic and evil subtypes or it must be a fiendish animal. Once selected, the choice is set, but it may be changed whenever the antipaladin gains a level. Upon reaching 7th level, and every two levels thereafter, the level of the <i>summon monster </i>spell increases by one, to a maximum of <i>summon monster IX </i>at 17th level. Once per day, as a full-round action, an antipaladin may magically call his servant to his side. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the antipaladin's level. The servant immediately appears adjacent to the antipaladin. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels thereafter, for a total of four times per day at 17th level. At 11th level, the servant gains the advanced template (see the <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary </i>). At 15th level, an antipaladin's servant gains spell resistance equal to the antipaladin's level + 11. Should the antipaladin's fiendish servant die or be banished, the antipaladin may not summon another servant for 30 days or until he gains an antipaladin level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>

					<p>The first type of bond allows the antipaladin to enhance his weapon as a standard action by calling upon the aid of a fiendish spirit for 1 minute per antipaladin level. When called, the spirit causes the weapon to shed unholy light as a torch. At 5th level, this spirit grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: <i>anarchic </i>, <i>flaming </i>, <i>flaming burst </i>, <i>keen </i>, <i>speed </i>, <i>unholy </i>, <i>vicious </i>, <i>vorpal </i>, and <i>wounding </i>. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table 15-9 in the <i>Core Rulebook </i>). These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The fiendish spirit imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than the antipaladin but resumes giving bonuses if returned to the antipaladin. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level. If a weapon bonded with a fiendish spirit is destroyed, the antipaladin loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until he gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>

An insinuator cannot use smite against a target that shares an alignment with the outsider he has invoked for the day. The insinuator adds his Charisma bonus on his attack rolls and half his insinuator level on all damage rolls made against the target of his smite. If the target is an outsider, dragon, or divine spellcaster with an alignment opposed to that of the outsider he has invoked for the day, the bonus damage on the first successful attack increases to 1 point of damage per antipaladin level the insinuator has.

					<p>Beginning at 4th level, an antipaladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells which are drawn from the antipaladin spell list presented in Chapter 5. An antipaladin must choose and prepare his spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, an antipaladin must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an antipaladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, an antipaladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is the same as that of a paladin and is given on Table 2-13. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-3 in the Core Rulebook). When Table 2-13 indicates that the antipaladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level. An antipaladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. An antipaladin may prepare and cast any spell on the antipaladin spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation. Through 3rd level, an antipaladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his antipaladin level -3.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Between the selfless nobility of paladins and the chaotic menace of antipaladins, there exists a path of dedicated self-interest. Shunning the ties that bind them to a single deity, insinuators embrace whatever forces help them achieve their own agenda and glory, borrowing power to emulate divine warriors.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although it is a rare occurrence, paladins do sometimes stray from the path of righteousness. Most of these wayward holy warriors seek out redemption and forgiveness for their misdeeds, regaining their powers through piety, charity, and powerful magic. Yet there are others, the dark and disturbed few, who turn actively to evil, courting the dark powers they once railed against in order to take vengeance on their former brothers. It's said that those who climb the farthest have the farthest to fall, and antipaladins are living proof of this fact, their pride and hatred blinding them to the glory of their forsaken patrons.</p>
			<p>Antipaladins become the antithesis of their former selves. They make pacts with fiends, take the lives of the innocent, and put nothing ahead of their personal power and wealth. Champions of evil, they often lead armies of evil creatures and work with other villains to bring ruin to the holy and tyranny to the weak. Not surprisingly, paladins stop at nothing to put an end to such nefarious antiheroes.</p>
			<p>The antipaladin is an alternate class. Making use of and altering numerous facets of the paladin core class, this villainous warrior can't truly be considered a new character class by its own right. By the changes made here, though, the details and tones of the paladin class are shifted in a completely opposite direction and captures an entirely different fantasy theme, without needlessly designing an entire new class. While a redesign of sorts, this alternate class can be used just as any of the other base classes found in the first part of this chapter.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: Antipaladins are villains at their most dangerous. They care nothing for the lives of others and actively seek to bring death and destruction to ordered society. They rarely travel with those that they do not subjugate, unless as part of a ruse to bring ruin from within.</p>
			<p>As an alternate paladin class, the antipaladin uses Table: Antipaladin to determine its base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, and spells per day. These details, along with the class's new special abilities, can be found on Table 2-13.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any evil.</p>
			<h>Ex-Insinuators</h>
			<p>An insinuator who willfully commits self less acts or engages in violence that doesn&#146;t further his own ends loses all class features (including his outsider servant, but not bonus feats or weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). He can&#146;t progress any further in levels as an insinuator. He regains his abilities and advancement potential if he atones for his faltering ambition (see the atonement spell). If he violates the code of conduct of his invoked outsider patron, he must similarly seek atonement from outsiders of that alignment again.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Antipaladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Invocation (Ex): </b>At the start of each day, an insinuator can meditate for 10 minutes to contact and barter with an outsider to empower him for a day. An insinuator can freely invoke an outsider of his own alignment. He can instead invoke an outsider within one step of his own alignment by succeeding at a Diplomacy or Knowledge (religion) skill check (DC = 15 + the insinuator&#146;s antipaladin level). While invoking the power of an outsider, the insinuator radiates an alignment aura that matches that of the outsider&#146;s, and becomes vulnerable to alignment-based effects that target that outsider&#146;s alignment (such as smite evil or chaos hammer). None of an insinuator&#146;s supernatural or spell-like class abilities function unless he has invoked the power of an outsider, and the alignment of the being invoked may affect how some abilities function.</p>
			<p><b>Detect Balance (Sp): </b>At will, an insinuator can detect strong moral leanings. This functions as detect evil or detect good, but does not actually reveal the target&#146;s alignment, only whether the target is neutral (rather than good or evil) and the relative strength of that aura. This ability alters detect good.</p>
			<p><b>Smite Impudence (Su): </b>Once per day, an insinuator can beseech the forces empowering him to punish their shared enemies. As a swift action, the insinuator chooses one target within sight to smite. An insinuator cannot use smite against a target that shares an alignment with the outsider he has invoked for the day. The insinuator adds his Charisma bonus on his attack rolls and half his insinuator level on all damage rolls made against the target of his smite. If the target is an outsider, dragon, or divine spellcaster with an alignment opposed to that of the outsider he has invoked for the day, the bonus damage on the first successful attack increases to 1 point of damage per antipaladin level the insinuator has. Regardless of the target, the smite attack automatically bypasses any damage reduction the creature might possess. In addition, each time the insinuator declares a smite, he gains a number of temporary hit points equal to his antipaladin level.</p>
			<p>The smite effect remains until the target is defeated or the next time the insinuator rests and regains his uses of this ability. At 4th level and at every 3 levels thereafter, the insinuator can use smite one additional time per day, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level. This ability replaces smite good.</p>
			<p><b>Unholy Resilience (Su) </b>: At 2nd level, an antipaladin gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Selfish Healing (Su): </b>Beginning at 2nd level, an insinuator can heal his wounds by touch. This is treated exactly like the paladin&#146;s lay on hands class feature, except it can be used only to heal the insinuator and cannot be used on other creatures. This ability replaces touch of corruption.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Ego (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, an insinuator radiates an aura that bolsters allies and deters enemies. Each ally within 10 feet gains a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. Enemies within 10 feet take a &#150;2 penalty on saving throws against fear effects. This ability functions only while the insinuator is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead. This ability replaces aura of cowardice.</p>
			<p><b>Stubborn Health (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, an insinuator takes only half damage from diseases and poisons, and none of his ability scores can be reduced below 1 by these effects. This ability replaces plague bringer.</p>
			<p><b>Greeds (Su) </b>: Beginning at 3rd level, an insinuator can heal himself of certain conditions. This functions as the mercy paladin class ability, but these mercies can only be applied to the insinuator himself. This ability replaces cruelty.</p>
			<p><b>Channel Energy (Su) </b>: At 4th level, an insinuator can channel negative energy, treating his antipaladin level as his effective cleric level. If he invokes a neutral outsider for the day, he may instead chose during the invocation to channel positive energy, but treats his effective cleric level as half his antipaladin level. Using this ability consumes two uses of his selfish healing ability. This is a Charisma-based ability. This ability alters channel negative energy.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feats: </b>At 4th level, an insinuator gains one bonus feat, which must be selected from the list of combat feats or Skill Focus. At 7th level and every 3 antipaladin levels thereafter, the insinuator gains one additional combat or Skill Focus feat. This ability replaces antipaladin spells.</p>
			<p><b>Ambitious Bond (Sp) </b>: At 5th level, an insinuator gains a divine bond with either a bonded weapon or an outsider servant. This functions as the antipaladin&#146;s fiendish boon with the following modifications.</p>
			<p><b>Bonded Weapon: </b>This functions as the antipaladin ability, except the first special ability added to a weapon must correspond to the alignment of the outsider the insinuator has invoked for that day: anarchic (chaos), axiomatic (law), or unholy (evil). Additional special abilities may be applied if any equivalent bonus remains.</p>
			<p><b>Outsider Servant: </b>This functions as the antipaladin ability, except the insinuator gains a new outsider servant each day, whose alignment must match the alignment of the outsider invoked for the day. The outsider servant functions as much as an agent for the patron invoked by the insinuator as an ally of the insinuator himself, and may turn against him if he violates his patron&#146;s alignment or interests.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Ambition (Su): </b>At 8th level, enemies within 10 feet of an insinuator take a &#150;1 penalty on all saving throws. All allies within 10 feet gain a +1 bonus on all saving throws. This penalty does not stack with the penalty from aura of the crusader. This ability functions only while the insinuator is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead. This ability replaces aura of despair.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Glory (Su): </b>At 11th level, an insinuator can expend two uses of his smite impudence ability to grant the ability to smite impudence to all allies within 10 feet, using his bonuses. Allies must use this smite impudence ability before the start of the insinuator&#146;s next turn, and the bonuses last for 1 minute. Using this ability is a free action. This ability replaces aura of vengeance.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Belief (Su): </b>At 14th level, an insinuator&#146;s weapons are treated as chaos-aligned while he invokes a chaotic outsider, law-aligned when he invokes a lawful outsider, or evil-aligned while he invokes an evil outsider. If he invokes an outsider with more than one alignment aura, the insinuator must choose during the initial invocation which alignment his weapon radiates. This ability replaces aura of sin.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Indomitability (Su): </b>At 17th level, an insinuator gains DR 10 that is bypassed by the alignment opposite of the outsider he has invoked for the day, or DR 5/&#151; while invoking a neutral outsider. This ability replaces aura of depravity.</p>
			<p><b>Personal Champion (Su): </b>At 20th level, an insinuator becomes a living embodiment of his selfish desires. His damage resistance from aura of indomitability increases to 15 (or 10 while invoking a neutral outsider). Whenever he uses smite impudence, he adds twice his full Charisma bonus to the attack roll and doubles his effective bonus damage gained from the smite. In addition, he can invoke a new outsider patron by meditating for 10 minutes. This ability replaces unholy champion.</p>
			<p><b>Code of Conduct </b>: An insinuator must always work toward his own self-interest, enrichment, or glory, and must also abide by the moral strictures of whatever outsider they have chosen to invoke that day (see invocation below). If the insinuator breaks an invoked outsider&#146;s code, he cannot invoke outsiders of that same alignment until he seeks atonement, although outsiders of other alignments may still heed his call.</p>
			<p><b>Associates </b>: While he may adventure with evil or neutral allies, an antipaladin avoids working with good characters or with anyone who consistently attempts to do good deeds. Under exceptional circumstances, an antipaladin can ally with good associates, but only to defeat them from within and bring ruin to their ranks. An antipaladin does not need an atonement spell during such an unusual alliance as long as his nefarious goals are met in the end-evil cares only about results. An antipaladin may accept only henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are chaotic evil.</p>

					<p>An antipaladin must be of chaotic evil alignment and loses all class features except proficiencies if he willingly and altruistically commits good acts. This does not mean that an antipaladin cannot take actions someone else might qualify as good, only that such actions must always be in service of his own dark ends. An antipaladin's code requires that he place his own interests and desires above all else, as well as impose tyranny, take advantage whenever possible, and punish the good and just, provided such actions don't interfere with his goals.</p>

					<p>The second type of bond allows an antipaladin to gain the service of a fiendish servant. This functions as <i>summon monster III </i>, except the duration is permanent and the antipaladin can only gain the service of a single creature and that creature must either have the chaotic and evil subtypes or it must be a fiendish animal. Once selected, the choice is set, but it may be changed whenever the antipaladin gains a level. Upon reaching 7th level, and every two levels thereafter, the level of the <i>summon monster </i>spell increases by one, to a maximum of <i>summon monster IX </i>at 17th level. Once per day, as a full-round action, an antipaladin may magically call his servant to his side. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the antipaladin's level. The servant immediately appears adjacent to the antipaladin. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels thereafter, for a total of four times per day at 17th level. At 11th level, the servant gains the advanced template (see the <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary </i>). At 15th level, an antipaladin's servant gains spell resistance equal to the antipaladin's level + 11. Should the antipaladin's fiendish servant die or be banished, the antipaladin may not summon another servant for 30 days or until he gains an antipaladin level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>

				<name type="string">Weapon Bond</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>The first type of bond allows the antipaladin to enhance his weapon as a standard action by calling upon the aid of a fiendish spirit for 1 minute per antipaladin level. When called, the spirit causes the weapon to shed unholy light as a torch. At 5th level, this spirit grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: <i>anarchic </i>, <i>flaming </i>, <i>flaming burst </i>, <i>keen </i>, <i>speed </i>, <i>unholy </i>, <i>vicious </i>, <i>vorpal </i>, and <i>wounding </i>. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table 15-9 in the <i>Core Rulebook </i>). These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The fiendish spirit imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than the antipaladin but resumes giving bonuses if returned to the antipaladin. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level. If a weapon bonded with a fiendish spirit is destroyed, the antipaladin loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until he gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>

If the target of smite good is an outsider with the good subtype, a good-aligned dragon, or a good creature with levels of cleric or paladin, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per level the antipaladin possesses. Regardless of the target, smite good attacks automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess. In addition, while smite good is in effect, the antipaladin gains a deflection bonus equal to his Charisma modifier (if any) to his AC against attacks made by the target of the smite. If the antipaladin targets a creature that is not good, the smite is wasted with no effect. The smite good effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time the antipaladin rests and regains his uses of this ability. At 4th level, and at every three levels thereafter, the antipaladin may smite good one additional time per day, as indicated on Table 2-13, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.</p>

					<p>Beginning at 4th level, an antipaladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells which are drawn from the antipaladin spell list presented in Chapter 5. An antipaladin must choose and prepare his spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, an antipaladin must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an antipaladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, an antipaladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is the same as that of a paladin and is given on Table 2-13. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-3 in the Core Rulebook). When Table 2-13 indicates that the antipaladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level. An antipaladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. An antipaladin may prepare and cast any spell on the antipaladin spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation. Through 3rd level, an antipaladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his antipaladin level -3.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The fearmonger wants to do more than cause pain, misery, and confusion. He wishes to spread fear among his foes and infect entire populations with it. The fearmonger archetype is available only to the antipaladin alternate class.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although it is a rare occurrence, paladins do sometimes stray from the path of righteousness. Most of these wayward holy warriors seek out redemption and forgiveness for their misdeeds, regaining their powers through piety, charity, and powerful magic. Yet there are others, the dark and disturbed few, who turn actively to evil, courting the dark powers they once railed against in order to take vengeance on their former brothers. It's said that those who climb the farthest have the farthest to fall, and antipaladins are living proof of this fact, their pride and hatred blinding them to the glory of their forsaken patrons.</p>
			<p>Antipaladins become the antithesis of their former selves. They make pacts with fiends, take the lives of the innocent, and put nothing ahead of their personal power and wealth. Champions of evil, they often lead armies of evil creatures and work with other villains to bring ruin to the holy and tyranny to the weak. Not surprisingly, paladins stop at nothing to put an end to such nefarious antiheroes.</p>
			<p>The antipaladin is an alternate class. Making use of and altering numerous facets of the paladin core class, this villainous warrior can't truly be considered a new character class by its own right. By the changes made here, though, the details and tones of the paladin class are shifted in a completely opposite direction and captures an entirely different fantasy theme, without needlessly designing an entire new class. While a redesign of sorts, this alternate class can be used just as any of the other base classes found in the first part of this chapter.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: Antipaladins are villains at their most dangerous. They care nothing for the lives of others and actively seek to bring death and destruction to ordered society. They rarely travel with those that they do not subjugate, unless as part of a ruse to bring ruin from within.</p>
			<p>As an alternate paladin class, the antipaladin uses Table: Antipaladin to determine its base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, and spells per day. These details, along with the class's new special abilities, can be found on Table 2-13.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Chaotic evil.</p>
			<h>Ex-Antipaladins</h>
			<p>A antipaladin who ceases to be chaotic evil, who willfully commits an good act, or who violates the code of conduct loses all antipaladin spells and class features (including the fiendish boon, but not weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). He may not progress any further in levels as an antipaladin. He regains his abilities and advancement potential if he atones for his violations (see the <i>atonement </i>spell), as appropriate.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Antipaladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Evil (Ex) </b>: The power of an antipaladin's aura of evil (see the <i>detect evil </i>spell) is equal to his antipaladin level. A paladin who uses smite evil on an antipaladin deals 2 points of damage per paladin level on his first successful attack.</p>
			<p><b>Detect Good (Sp) </b>: At will, an antipaladin can use <i>detect good </i>, as the spell. An antipaladin can, as a move action, concentrate on a single item or individual within 60 feet and determine if it is good, learning the strength of its aura as if having studied it for 3 rounds. While focusing on one individual or object, the antipaladin does not detect good in any other object or individual within range.</p>
			<p><b>Smite Good (Su) </b>: Once per day, an antipaladin can call out to the dark powers to crush the forces of good. As a swift action, the antipaladin chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is good, the antipaladin adds his Charisma bonus (if any) on his attack rolls and adds his antipaladin level on all damage rolls made against the target of his smite. If the target of smite good is an outsider with the good subtype, a good-aligned dragon, or a good creature with levels of cleric or paladin, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per level the antipaladin possesses. Regardless of the target, smite good attacks automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess.</p>
			<p>In addition, while smite good is in effect, the antipaladin gains a deflection bonus equal to his Charisma modifier (if any) to his AC against attacks made by the target of the smite. If the antipaladin targets a creature that is not good, the smite is wasted with no effect.</p>
			<p>The smite good effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time the antipaladin rests and regains his uses of this ability. At 4th level, and at every three levels thereafter, the antipaladin may smite good one additional time per day, as indicated on Table 2-13, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Unholy Resilience (Su) </b>: At 2nd level, an antipaladin gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Feed on Fear (Su): </b>At 2nd level, the first time in a round a creature fails a saving throw against a fear effect created by a fearmonger&#146;s spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability (including any ability that causes a creature to be shaken, frightened, or panicked), the fearmonger is healed of 1 point of damage per 2 antipaladin levels. If the fearmonger is at full hit points when this ability is activated, he instead gains an equal number of temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute. Temporary hit points gained through multiple successful uses of this ability do not stack; the duration increases instead.</p>
			<p>The antipaladin can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 his antipaladin level plus his Charisma bonus. This ability replaces touch of corruption.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Cowardice (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, an antipaladin radiates a palpably daunting aura that causes all enemies within 10 feet to take a -4 penalty on saving throws against fear effects. Creatures that are normally immune to fear lose that immunity while within 10 feet of an antipaladin with this ability. This ability functions only while the antipaladin remains conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Plague Bringer (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, the powers of darkness make an antipaladin a beacon of corruption and disease. An antipaladin does not take any damage or take any penalty from diseases. He can still contract diseases and spread them to others, but he is otherwise immune to their effects.</p>
			<p><b>Cruelty (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, an antipaladin can select one cruelty. Each cruelty adds an effect to the antipaladin's touch of corruption ability. Whenever the antipaladin uses touch of corruption to deal damage to one target, the target also receives the additional effect from one of the cruelties possessed by the antipaladin. This choice is made when the touch is used. The target receives a Fortitude save to avoid this cruelty. If the save is successful, the target takes the damage as normal, but not the effects of the cruelty. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the antipaladin's level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. At 3rd level, the antipaladin can select from the following initial cruelties.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Fatigued </i>: The target is fatigued.</li>
				<li><i>Shaken </i>: The target is shaken for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Sickened </i>: The target is sickened for 1 round per level of the antipaladin. At 6th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Dazed </i>: The target is dazed for 1 round.</li>
				<li><i>Diseased </i>: The target contracts a disease, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>contagion </i>, using his antipaladin level as his caster level.</li>
				<li><i>Staggered </i>: The target is staggered for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin. At 9th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Cursed </i>: The target is cursed, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>bestow curse </i>, using his antipaladin level as his caster level.</li>
				<li><i>Exhausted </i>: The target is exhausted. The antipaladin must have the fatigue cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Frightened </i>: The target is frightened for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the shaken cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Nauseated </i>: The target is nauseated for 1 round per three levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the sickened cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Poisoned </i>: The target is poisoned, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>poison </i>, using the antipaladin's level as the caster level. At 12th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Blinded </i>: The target is blinded for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Deafened </i>: The target is deafened for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Paralyzed </i>: The target is paralyzed for 1 round.</li>
				<li><i>Stunned </i>: The target is stunned for 1 round per four levels of the antipaladin. These abilities are not cumulative. For example, a 12th-level antipaladin's touch of corruption ability deals 6d6 points of damage and might also cause the target to become fatigued, dazed, poisoned, or diseased. Once a cruelty is chosen, it can't be changed.</li>
			</list>
			<p><b>Frightening Cruelty (Su): </b>The fearmonger must select shaken as his 3rd-level cruelty, dazed as his 6th-level cruelty, and frightened as his 9th-level cruelty. At 12th level, the fearmonger gains the panicked cruelty.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Panicked: </i>The target is panicked for 1 round per 4 class levels the antipaladin possesses. The antipaladin must have the shaken and frightened cruelties before selecting this cruelty.</li>
			</list>
			<p>This class feature alters cruelty.</p>
			<p><b>Channel Negative Energy (Su) </b>: When an antipaladin reaches 4th level, he gains the supernatural ability to channel negative energy like a cleric. Using this ability consumes two uses of his touch of corruption ability. An antipaladin uses his level as his effective cleric level when channeling negative energy. This is a Charisma-based ability.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: Beginning at 4th level, an antipaladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells which are drawn from the antipaladin spell list presented in Chapter 5. An antipaladin must choose and prepare his spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, an antipaladin must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an antipaladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, an antipaladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is the same as that of a paladin and is given on Table 2-13. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-3 in the Core Rulebook). When Table 2-13 indicates that the antipaladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>An antipaladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. An antipaladin may prepare and cast any spell on the antipaladin spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, an antipaladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his antipaladin level -3.</p>
			<p><b>Fiendish Boon (Sp) </b>: Upon reaching 5th level, an antipaladin receives a boon from his dark patrons. This boon can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Bond </b>: The first type of bond allows the antipaladin to enhance his weapon as a standard action by calling upon the aid of a fiendish spirit for 1 minute per antipaladin level. When called, the spirit causes the weapon to shed unholy light as a torch. At 5th level, this spirit grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: <i>anarchic </i>, <i>flaming </i>, <i>flaming burst </i>, <i>keen </i>, <i>speed </i>, <i>unholy </i>, <i>vicious </i>, <i>vorpal </i>, and <i>wounding </i>. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table 15-9 in the <i>Core Rulebook </i>). These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The fiendish spirit imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than the antipaladin but resumes giving bonuses if returned to the antipaladin. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level.</p>
			<p>If a weapon bonded with a fiendish spirit is destroyed, the antipaladin loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until he gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>
			<p><b>Fiendish Servant </b>: The second type of bond allows an antipaladin to gain the service of a fiendish servant. This functions as <i>summon monster III </i>, except the duration is permanent and the antipaladin can only gain the service of a single creature and that creature must either have the chaotic and evil subtypes or it must be a fiendish animal. Once selected, the choice is set, but it may be changed whenever the antipaladin gains a level. Upon reaching 7th level, and every two levels thereafter, the level of the <i>summon monster </i>spell increases by one, to a maximum of <i>summon monster IX </i>at 17th level.</p>
			<p>Once per day, as a full-round action, an antipaladin may magically call his servant to his side. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the antipaladin's level. The servant immediately appears adjacent to the antipaladin. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels thereafter, for a total of four times per day at 17th level.</p>
			<p>At 11th level, the servant gains the advanced template (see the <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary </i>). At 15th level, an antipaladin's servant gains spell resistance equal to the antipaladin's level + 11.</p>
			<p>Should the antipaladin's fiendish servant die or be banished, the antipaladin may not summon another servant for 30 days or until he gains an antipaladin level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Despair (Su) </b>: At 8th level, enemies within 10 feet of an antipaladin take a -2 penalty on all saving throws. This penalty does not stack with the penalty from aura of cowardice.</p>
			<p>This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Vengeance (Su) </b>: At 11th level, an antipaladin can expend two uses of his smite good ability to grant the ability to smite good to all allies within 10 feet, using his bonuses. Allies must use this smite good ability by the start of the antipaladin's next turn and the bonuses last for 1 minute. Using this ability is a free action. Good creatures gain no benefit from this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Sin (Su) </b>: At 14th level, an antipaladin's weapons are treated as evil-aligned for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. Any attack made against an enemy within 10 feet of him is treated as evil-aligned for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Depravity (Su) </b>: At 17th level, an antipaladin gains DR 5/good. Each enemy within 10 feet takes a -4 penalty on saving throws against compulsion effects. This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Unholy Champion (Su) </b>: At 20th level, an antipaladin becomes a conduit for the might of the dark powers. His DR increases to 10/good. Whenever he uses smite good and successfully strikes an good outsider, the outsider is also subject to a <i>banishment </i>, using his antipaladin level as the caster level (his weapon and unholy symbol automatically count as objects that the subject hates). After the <i>banishment </i>effect and the damage from the attack is resolved, the smite immediately ends. In addition, whenever he channels negative energy or uses touch of corruption to damage a creature, he deals the maximum possible amount.</p>
			<p><b>Code of Conduct </b>: An antipaladin must be of chaotic evil alignment and loses all class features except proficiencies if he willingly and altruistically commits good acts. This does not mean that an antipaladin cannot take actions someone else might qualify as good, only that such actions must always be in service of his own dark ends. An antipaladin's code requires that he place his own interests and desires above all else, as well as impose tyranny, take advantage whenever possible, and punish the good and just, provided such actions don't interfere with his goals.</p>
			<p><b>Associates </b>: While he may adventure with evil or neutral allies, an antipaladin avoids working with good characters or with anyone who consistently attempts to do good deeds. Under exceptional circumstances, an antipaladin can ally with good associates, but only to defeat them from within and bring ruin to their ranks. An antipaladin does not need an atonement spell during such an unusual alliance as long as his nefarious goals are met in the end-evil cares only about results. An antipaladin may accept only henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are chaotic evil.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level, an antipaladin radiates a palpably daunting aura that causes all enemies within 10 feet to take a -4 penalty on saving throws against fear effects. Creatures that are normally immune to fear lose that immunity while within 10 feet of an antipaladin with this ability.

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 14th level, a dread vanguard becomes a true messenger of the forces of darkness he serves. Once per day, the dread vanguard can expend two uses of his touch of corruption ability to mark one location within 60 feet with the stain of evil. This location can be any point in space, but the ability works best if placed on an altar, shrine, or other site important to a community. The location is affected as if by a desecrate spell. Creatures approaching within 30 feet of the site must succeed at a Will save or suffer the effects of crushing despair.</p>
					<p>At 17th level, the dread vanguard can also mark the site with a symbol of pain, and at 20th level, he adds a symbol of weakness. If available, all three of these effects overlap. Creatures must save against each effect individually, and the effects stack. The caster level for all effects is equal to the dread vanguard&#146;s class level. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the antipaladin&#146;s level + his Charisma modifier. A location remains marked in this way for up to 1 day per antipaladin level. During this time, the crushing despair and symbols are triggered when the first target enters each spell&#146;s area. They remain active for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again if targets are within range. If the effects are disabled, they become inactive for 10 minutes, but then can be triggered again as normal. Dispel magic and similar spells suppress the effects, and all effects of dark emissary can be removed by a consecrate spell cast on the location by a cleric of a level equal to or higher than the dread vanguard.</p>
					<p>Allies or evil creatures who serve the same power or organization as the dread vanguard are immune to the crushing despair and symbol effects, and automatically know that the location has been marked for their masters. They can treat this location as very familiar for the purpose of teleport and similar spells and can use scrying and related spells as though they were familiar with any subject within 20 feet of it. At 14th level, a dread vanguard can have one marked site active at a time. At 17th and 20th levels, he can add one additional site that is simultaneously active. Marking a new site beyond this limit ends all effects on the oldest active site. This ability replaces aura of sin.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, an antipaladin can select one cruelty. Each cruelty adds an effect to the antipaladin's touch of corruption ability.

						<li><i>Shaken </i>: The target is shaken for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>

						<li><i>Dazed </i>: The target is dazed for 1 round.</li>
						<li><i>Diseased </i>: The target contracts a disease, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>contagion </i>, using his antipaladin level as his caster level.</li>

						<li><i>Cursed </i>: The target is cursed, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>bestow curse </i>, using his antipaladin level as his caster level.</li>
						<li><i>Exhausted </i>: The target is exhausted. The antipaladin must have the fatigue cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
						<li><i>Frightened </i>: The target is frightened for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the shaken cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
						<li><i>Nauseated </i>: The target is nauseated for 1 round per three levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the sickened cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
						<li><i>Poisoned </i>: The target is poisoned, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>poison </i>, using the antipaladin's level as the caster level. At 12th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
						<li><i>Blinded </i>: The target is blinded for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>

						<li><i>Stunned </i>: The target is stunned for 1 round per four levels of the antipaladin. These abilities are not cumulative. For example, a 12th-level antipaladin's touch of corruption ability deals 6d6 points of damage and might also cause the target to become fatigued, dazed, poisoned, or diseased.

As a standard action, he can spend a use of his touch of corruption ability to manifest the darkness in his soul as an area of flickering shadows with a 30-foot radius centered on him. These shadows don&#146;t affect visibility. The antipaladin and all allies in the area gain a +1 morale bonus to AC and on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against fear, and also ignore the first 5 points of hardness when attacking unattended inanimate objects. This lasts for 1 minute, as long as the dread vanguard is conscious.</p>
					<p>At 8th level, the aura grants fast healing 3 to the dread vanguard as well as to his allies while they remain within it. Additionally, while this aura is active, the antipaladin can use his touch of corruption ability against any targets within its radius by making a ranged touch attack.</p>
					<p>At 12th level, when he activates this ability, a dread vanguard can choose to increase the radius of one antipaladin aura he possesses to 30 feet. Also, the morale bonus granted to AC and on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against fear increases to +2.</p>
					<p>At 16th level, the fast healing granted by this ability increases to 5. Additionally, the antipaladin&#146;s weapons and those of his allies within the aura&#146;s radius are considered evil for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
					<p>At 20th level, the beacon of evil&#146;s radius increases to 60 feet, and the morale bonus granted to AC and on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against fear increases to +4. Lastly, attacks made by the dread vanguard and his allies within the aura&#146;s radius are infused with pure unholy power, and deal an additional 1d6 points of damage.</p>

Alternatively, an antipaladin can use this power to heal undead creatures, restoring 1d6 hit points for every two levels the antipaladin possesses.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some antipaladins serve or ally themselves with villains who are bent on earthly conquest. They care nothing for the intricacies of divine spellcasting, but malevolent energy still surrounds them. Whether alone or at the head of a marauding host, these cruel warriors bring suffering and death&#151;but their presence also heralds the coming of a greater evil.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although it is a rare occurrence, paladins do sometimes stray from the path of righteousness. Most of these wayward holy warriors seek out redemption and forgiveness for their misdeeds, regaining their powers through piety, charity, and powerful magic. Yet there are others, the dark and disturbed few, who turn actively to evil, courting the dark powers they once railed against in order to take vengeance on their former brothers. It's said that those who climb the farthest have the farthest to fall, and antipaladins are living proof of this fact, their pride and hatred blinding them to the glory of their forsaken patrons.</p>
			<p>Antipaladins become the antithesis of their former selves. They make pacts with fiends, take the lives of the innocent, and put nothing ahead of their personal power and wealth. Champions of evil, they often lead armies of evil creatures and work with other villains to bring ruin to the holy and tyranny to the weak. Not surprisingly, paladins stop at nothing to put an end to such nefarious antiheroes.</p>
			<p>The antipaladin is an alternate class. Making use of and altering numerous facets of the paladin core class, this villainous warrior can't truly be considered a new character class by its own right. By the changes made here, though, the details and tones of the paladin class are shifted in a completely opposite direction and captures an entirely different fantasy theme, without needlessly designing an entire new class. While a redesign of sorts, this alternate class can be used just as any of the other base classes found in the first part of this chapter.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: Antipaladins are villains at their most dangerous. They care nothing for the lives of others and actively seek to bring death and destruction to ordered society. They rarely travel with those that they do not subjugate, unless as part of a ruse to bring ruin from within.</p>
			<p>As an alternate paladin class, the antipaladin uses Table: Antipaladin to determine its base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, and spells per day. These details, along with the class's new special abilities, can be found on Table 2-13.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Chaotic evil.</p>
			<h>Ex-Antipaladins</h>
			<p>A antipaladin who ceases to be chaotic evil, who willfully commits an good act, or who violates the code of conduct loses all antipaladin spells and class features (including the fiendish boon, but not weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). He may not progress any further in levels as an antipaladin. He regains his abilities and advancement potential if he atones for his violations (see the <i>atonement </i>spell), as appropriate.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Antipaladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Evil (Ex) </b>: The power of an antipaladin's aura of evil (see the <i>detect evil </i>spell) is equal to his antipaladin level. A paladin who uses smite evil on an antipaladin deals 2 points of damage per paladin level on his first successful attack.</p>
			<p><b>Detect Good (Sp) </b>: At will, an antipaladin can use <i>detect good </i>, as the spell. An antipaladin can, as a move action, concentrate on a single item or individual within 60 feet and determine if it is good, learning the strength of its aura as if having studied it for 3 rounds. While focusing on one individual or object, the antipaladin does not detect good in any other object or individual within range.</p>
			<p><b>Smite Good (Su) </b>: Once per day, an antipaladin can call out to the dark powers to crush the forces of good. As a swift action, the antipaladin chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is good, the antipaladin adds his Charisma bonus (if any) on his attack rolls and adds his antipaladin level on all damage rolls made against the target of his smite. If the target of smite good is an outsider with the good subtype, a good-aligned dragon, or a good creature with levels of cleric or paladin, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per level the antipaladin possesses. Regardless of the target, smite good attacks automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess.</p>
			<p>In addition, while smite good is in effect, the antipaladin gains a deflection bonus equal to his Charisma modifier (if any) to his AC against attacks made by the target of the smite. If the antipaladin targets a creature that is not good, the smite is wasted with no effect.</p>
			<p>The smite good effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time the antipaladin rests and regains his uses of this ability. At 4th level, and at every three levels thereafter, the antipaladin may smite good one additional time per day, as indicated on Table 2-13, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Unholy Resilience (Su) </b>: At 2nd level, an antipaladin gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Touch of Corruption (Su) </b>: Beginning at 2nd level, an antipaladin surrounds his hand with a fiendish flame, causing terrible wounds to open on those he touches. Each day he can use this ability a number of times equal to 1/2 his antipaladin level + his Charisma modifier. As a touch attack, an antipaladin can cause 1d6 points of damage for every two antipaladin levels he possesses. Using this ability is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
			<p>Alternatively, an antipaladin can use this power to heal undead creatures, restoring 1d6 hit points for every two levels the antipaladin possesses. This ability is modified by any feat, spell, or effect that specifically works with the lay on hands paladin class feature. For example, the Extra Lay On Hands feat grants an antipaladin 2 additional uses of the touch of corruption class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Cowardice (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, an antipaladin radiates a palpably daunting aura that causes all enemies within 10 feet to take a -4 penalty on saving throws against fear effects. Creatures that are normally immune to fear lose that immunity while within 10 feet of an antipaladin with this ability. This ability functions only while the antipaladin remains conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Plague Bringer (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, the powers of darkness make an antipaladin a beacon of corruption and disease. An antipaladin does not take any damage or take any penalty from diseases. He can still contract diseases and spread them to others, but he is otherwise immune to their effects.</p>
			<p><b>Cruelty (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, an antipaladin can select one cruelty. Each cruelty adds an effect to the antipaladin's touch of corruption ability. Whenever the antipaladin uses touch of corruption to deal damage to one target, the target also receives the additional effect from one of the cruelties possessed by the antipaladin. This choice is made when the touch is used. The target receives a Fortitude save to avoid this cruelty. If the save is successful, the target takes the damage as normal, but not the effects of the cruelty. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the antipaladin's level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. At 3rd level, the antipaladin can select from the following initial cruelties.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Fatigued </i>: The target is fatigued.</li>
				<li><i>Shaken </i>: The target is shaken for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Sickened </i>: The target is sickened for 1 round per level of the antipaladin. At 6th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Dazed </i>: The target is dazed for 1 round.</li>
				<li><i>Diseased </i>: The target contracts a disease, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>contagion </i>, using his antipaladin level as his caster level.</li>
				<li><i>Staggered </i>: The target is staggered for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin. At 9th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Cursed </i>: The target is cursed, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>bestow curse </i>, using his antipaladin level as his caster level.</li>
				<li><i>Exhausted </i>: The target is exhausted. The antipaladin must have the fatigue cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Frightened </i>: The target is frightened for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the shaken cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Nauseated </i>: The target is nauseated for 1 round per three levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the sickened cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Poisoned </i>: The target is poisoned, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>poison </i>, using the antipaladin's level as the caster level. At 12th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Blinded </i>: The target is blinded for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Deafened </i>: The target is deafened for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Paralyzed </i>: The target is paralyzed for 1 round.</li>
				<li><i>Stunned </i>: The target is stunned for 1 round per four levels of the antipaladin. These abilities are not cumulative. For example, a 12th-level antipaladin's touch of corruption ability deals 6d6 points of damage and might also cause the target to become fatigued, dazed, poisoned, or diseased. Once a cruelty is chosen, it can't be changed.</li>
			</list>
			<p><b>Channel Negative Energy (Su) </b>: When an antipaladin reaches 4th level, he gains the supernatural ability to channel negative energy like a cleric. Using this ability consumes two uses of his touch of corruption ability. An antipaladin uses his level as his effective cleric level when channeling negative energy. This is a Charisma-based ability.</p>
			<p><b>Beacon of Evil (Su): </b>A dread vanguard unleashes the powers of his vile masters to strengthen both himself and his allies.</p>
			<p>At 4th level and every 4 level thereafter, a dread vanguard gains one additional use of his touch of corruption ability per day. As a standard action, he can spend a use of his touch of corruption ability to manifest the darkness in his soul as an area of flickering shadows with a 30-foot radius centered on him. These shadows don&#146;t affect visibility. The antipaladin and all allies in the area gain a +1 morale bonus to AC and on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against fear, and also ignore the first 5 points of hardness when attacking unattended inanimate objects. This lasts for 1 minute, as long as the dread vanguard is conscious.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the aura grants fast healing 3 to the dread vanguard as well as to his allies while they remain within it. Additionally, while this aura is active, the antipaladin can use his touch of corruption ability against any targets within its radius by making a ranged touch attack.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, when he activates this ability, a dread vanguard can choose to increase the radius of one antipaladin aura he possesses to 30 feet. Also, the morale bonus granted to AC and on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against fear increases to +2.</p>
			<p>At 16th level, the fast healing granted by this ability increases to 5. Additionally, the antipaladin&#146;s weapons and those of his allies within the aura&#146;s radius are considered evil for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
			<p>At 20th level, the beacon of evil&#146;s radius increases to 60 feet, and the morale bonus granted to AC and on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against fear increases to +4. Lastly, attacks made by the dread vanguard and his allies within the aura&#146;s radius are infused with pure unholy power, and deal an additional 1d6 points of damage.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the spells class feature. A dread vanguard does not gain any spells or spellcasting abilities, cannot use spell trigger or spell completion magic items, and does not have a caster level from this class.</p>
			<p><b>Fiendish Boon (Sp) </b>: Upon reaching 5th level, an antipaladin receives a boon from his dark patrons. This boon can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Bond </b>: The first type of bond allows the antipaladin to enhance his weapon as a standard action by calling upon the aid of a fiendish spirit for 1 minute per antipaladin level. When called, the spirit causes the weapon to shed unholy light as a torch. At 5th level, this spirit grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: <i>anarchic </i>, <i>flaming </i>, <i>flaming burst </i>, <i>keen </i>, <i>speed </i>, <i>unholy </i>, <i>vicious </i>, <i>vorpal </i>, and <i>wounding </i>. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table 15-9 in the <i>Core Rulebook </i>). These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The fiendish spirit imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than the antipaladin but resumes giving bonuses if returned to the antipaladin. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level.</p>
			<p>If a weapon bonded with a fiendish spirit is destroyed, the antipaladin loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until he gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>
			<p><b>Fiendish Servant </b>: The second type of bond allows an antipaladin to gain the service of a fiendish servant. This functions as <i>summon monster III </i>, except the duration is permanent and the antipaladin can only gain the service of a single creature and that creature must either have the chaotic and evil subtypes or it must be a fiendish animal. Once selected, the choice is set, but it may be changed whenever the antipaladin gains a level. Upon reaching 7th level, and every two levels thereafter, the level of the <i>summon monster </i>spell increases by one, to a maximum of <i>summon monster IX </i>at 17th level.</p>
			<p>Once per day, as a full-round action, an antipaladin may magically call his servant to his side. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the antipaladin's level. The servant immediately appears adjacent to the antipaladin. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels thereafter, for a total of four times per day at 17th level.</p>
			<p>At 11th level, the servant gains the advanced template (see the <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary </i>). At 15th level, an antipaladin's servant gains spell resistance equal to the antipaladin's level + 11.</p>
			<p>Should the antipaladin's fiendish servant die or be banished, the antipaladin may not summon another servant for 30 days or until he gains an antipaladin level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Despair (Su) </b>: At 8th level, enemies within 10 feet of an antipaladin take a -2 penalty on all saving throws. This penalty does not stack with the penalty from aura of cowardice.</p>
			<p>This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Vengeance (Su) </b>: At 11th level, an antipaladin can expend two uses of his smite good ability to grant the ability to smite good to all allies within 10 feet, using his bonuses. Allies must use this smite good ability by the start of the antipaladin's next turn and the bonuses last for 1 minute. Using this ability is a free action. Good creatures gain no benefit from this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Dark Emissary (Sp): </b>At 14th level, a dread vanguard becomes a true messenger of the forces of darkness he serves. Once per day, the dread vanguard can expend two uses of his touch of corruption ability to mark one location within 60 feet with the stain of evil. This location can be any point in space, but the ability works best if placed on an altar, shrine, or other site important to a community. The location is affected as if by a desecrate spell. Creatures approaching within 30 feet of the site must succeed at a Will save or suffer the effects of crushing despair.</p>
			<p>At 17th level, the dread vanguard can also mark the site with a symbol of pain, and at 20th level, he adds a symbol of weakness. If available, all three of these effects overlap. Creatures must save against each effect individually, and the effects stack. The caster level for all effects is equal to the dread vanguard&#146;s class level. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the antipaladin&#146;s level + his Charisma modifier. A location remains marked in this way for up to 1 day per antipaladin level. During this time, the crushing despair and symbols are triggered when the first target enters each spell&#146;s area. They remain active for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again if targets are within range. If the effects are disabled, they become inactive for 10 minutes, but then can be triggered again as normal. Dispel magic and similar spells suppress the effects, and all effects of dark emissary can be removed by a consecrate spell cast on the location by a cleric of a level equal to or higher than the dread vanguard.</p>
			<p>Allies or evil creatures who serve the same power or organization as the dread vanguard are immune to the crushing despair and symbol effects, and automatically know that the location has been marked for their masters. They can treat this location as very familiar for the purpose of teleport and similar spells and can use scrying and related spells as though they were familiar with any subject within 20 feet of it. At 14th level, a dread vanguard can have one marked site active at a time. At 17th and 20th levels, he can add one additional site that is simultaneously active. Marking a new site beyond this limit ends all effects on the oldest active site. This ability replaces aura of sin.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Depravity (Su) </b>: At 17th level, an antipaladin gains DR 5/good. Each enemy within 10 feet takes a -4 penalty on saving throws against compulsion effects. This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Unholy Champion (Su) </b>: At 20th level, an antipaladin becomes a conduit for the might of the dark powers. His DR increases to 10/good. Whenever he uses smite good and successfully strikes an good outsider, the outsider is also subject to a <i>banishment </i>, using his antipaladin level as the caster level (his weapon and unholy symbol automatically count as objects that the subject hates). After the <i>banishment </i>effect and the damage from the attack is resolved, the smite immediately ends. In addition, whenever he channels negative energy or uses touch of corruption to damage a creature, he deals the maximum possible amount.</p>
			<p><b>Code of Conduct </b>: An antipaladin must be of chaotic evil alignment and loses all class features except proficiencies if he willingly and altruistically commits good acts. This does not mean that an antipaladin cannot take actions someone else might qualify as good, only that such actions must always be in service of his own dark ends. An antipaladin's code requires that he place his own interests and desires above all else, as well as impose tyranny, take advantage whenever possible, and punish the good and just, provided such actions don't interfere with his goals.</p>
			<p><b>Associates </b>: While he may adventure with evil or neutral allies, an antipaladin avoids working with good characters or with anyone who consistently attempts to do good deeds. Under exceptional circumstances, an antipaladin can ally with good associates, but only to defeat them from within and bring ruin to their ranks. An antipaladin does not need an atonement spell during such an unusual alliance as long as his nefarious goals are met in the end-evil cares only about results. An antipaladin may accept only henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are chaotic evil.</p>

Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table 15-9 in the <i>Core Rulebook </i>). These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The fiendish spirit imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than the antipaladin but resumes giving bonuses if returned to the antipaladin. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level. If a weapon bonded with a fiendish spirit is destroyed, the antipaladin loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until he gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>

In addition, while smite good is in effect, the antipaladin gains a deflection bonus equal to his Charisma modifier (if any) to his AC against attacks made by the target of the smite. If the antipaladin targets a creature that is not good, the smite is wasted with no effect. The smite good effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time the antipaladin rests and regains his uses of this ability. At 4th level, and at every three levels thereafter, the antipaladin may smite good one additional time per day, as indicated on Table 2-13, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.</p>

					<p>Beginning at 4th level, an antipaladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells which are drawn from the antipaladin spell list presented in Chapter 5. An antipaladin must choose and prepare his spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, an antipaladin must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an antipaladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, an antipaladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is the same as that of a paladin and is given on Table 2-13. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-3 in the Core Rulebook). When Table 2-13 indicates that the antipaladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level. An antipaladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. An antipaladin may prepare and cast any spell on the antipaladin spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation. Through 3rd level, an antipaladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his antipaladin level -3.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Blighted myrmidons carry the seed of rot in their black hearts and sap life from the natural world.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although it is a rare occurrence, paladins do sometimes stray from the path of righteousness. Most of these wayward holy warriors seek out redemption and forgiveness for their misdeeds, regaining their powers through piety, charity, and powerful magic. Yet there are others, the dark and disturbed few, who turn actively to evil, courting the dark powers they once railed against in order to take vengeance on their former brothers. It's said that those who climb the farthest have the farthest to fall, and antipaladins are living proof of this fact, their pride and hatred blinding them to the glory of their forsaken patrons.</p>
			<p>Antipaladins become the antithesis of their former selves. They make pacts with fiends, take the lives of the innocent, and put nothing ahead of their personal power and wealth. Champions of evil, they often lead armies of evil creatures and work with other villains to bring ruin to the holy and tyranny to the weak. Not surprisingly, paladins stop at nothing to put an end to such nefarious antiheroes.</p>
			<p>The antipaladin is an alternate class. Making use of and altering numerous facets of the paladin core class, this villainous warrior can't truly be considered a new character class by its own right. By the changes made here, though, the details and tones of the paladin class are shifted in a completely opposite direction and captures an entirely different fantasy theme, without needlessly designing an entire new class. While a redesign of sorts, this alternate class can be used just as any of the other base classes found in the first part of this chapter.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: Antipaladins are villains at their most dangerous. They care nothing for the lives of others and actively seek to bring death and destruction to ordered society. They rarely travel with those that they do not subjugate, unless as part of a ruse to bring ruin from within.</p>
			<p>As an alternate paladin class, the antipaladin uses Table: Antipaladin to determine its base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, and spells per day. These details, along with the class's new special abilities, can be found on Table 2-13.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Chaotic evil.</p>
			<h>Ex-Antipaladins</h>
			<p>A antipaladin who ceases to be chaotic evil, who willfully commits an good act, or who violates the code of conduct loses all antipaladin spells and class features (including the fiendish boon, but not weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). He may not progress any further in levels as an antipaladin. He regains his abilities and advancement potential if he atones for his violations (see the <i>atonement </i>spell), as appropriate.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Antipaladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Evil (Ex) </b>: The power of an antipaladin's aura of evil (see the <i>detect evil </i>spell) is equal to his antipaladin level. A paladin who uses smite evil on an antipaladin deals 2 points of damage per paladin level on his first successful attack.</p>
			<p><b>Detect Good (Sp) </b>: At will, an antipaladin can use <i>detect good </i>, as the spell. An antipaladin can, as a move action, concentrate on a single item or individual within 60 feet and determine if it is good, learning the strength of its aura as if having studied it for 3 rounds. While focusing on one individual or object, the antipaladin does not detect good in any other object or individual within range.</p>
			<p><b>Smite Good (Su) </b>: Once per day, an antipaladin can call out to the dark powers to crush the forces of good. As a swift action, the antipaladin chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is good, the antipaladin adds his Charisma bonus (if any) on his attack rolls and adds his antipaladin level on all damage rolls made against the target of his smite. If the target of smite good is an outsider with the good subtype, a good-aligned dragon, or a good creature with levels of cleric or paladin, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per level the antipaladin possesses. Regardless of the target, smite good attacks automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess.</p>
			<p>In addition, while smite good is in effect, the antipaladin gains a deflection bonus equal to his Charisma modifier (if any) to his AC against attacks made by the target of the smite. If the antipaladin targets a creature that is not good, the smite is wasted with no effect.</p>
			<p>The smite good effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time the antipaladin rests and regains his uses of this ability. At 4th level, and at every three levels thereafter, the antipaladin may smite good one additional time per day, as indicated on Table 2-13, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Smite Nature (Su): </b>A blighted myrmidon can drain the life from a creature tied to nature. As a swift action, the blighted myrmidon chooses one target within sight to smite. Regardless of its alignment, if the target is an animal, plant, or vermin, the blighted myrmidon adds her Charisma bonus (if any) on her attack rolls and adds her blighted myrmidon level on damage rolls against the target of her smite. If the target of smite nature is an elemental, a fey, or a creature with levels of druid, hunter, ranger, or shifter, the bonus on damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per class level the blighted myrmidon has. This ability otherwise functions as smite good.</p>
			<p>This alters smite good.</p>
			<p><b>Unholy Resilience (Su) </b>: At 2nd level, an antipaladin gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Touch of Corruption (Su) </b>: Beginning at 2nd level, an antipaladin surrounds his hand with a fiendish flame, causing terrible wounds to open on those he touches. Each day he can use this ability a number of times equal to 1/2 his antipaladin level + his Charisma modifier. As a touch attack, an antipaladin can cause 1d6 points of damage for every two antipaladin levels he possesses. Using this ability is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
			<p>Alternatively, an antipaladin can use this power to heal undead creatures, restoring 1d6 hit points for every two levels the antipaladin possesses. This ability is modified by any feat, spell, or effect that specifically works with the lay on hands paladin class feature. For example, the Extra Lay On Hands feat grants an antipaladin 2 additional uses of the touch of corruption class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Cowardice (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, an antipaladin radiates a palpably daunting aura that causes all enemies within 10 feet to take a -4 penalty on saving throws against fear effects. Creatures that are normally immune to fear lose that immunity while within 10 feet of an antipaladin with this ability. This ability functions only while the antipaladin remains conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Plague Bringer (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, the powers of darkness make an antipaladin a beacon of corruption and disease. An antipaladin does not take any damage or take any penalty from diseases. He can still contract diseases and spread them to others, but he is otherwise immune to their effects.</p>
			<p><b>Cruelty (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, an antipaladin can select one cruelty. Each cruelty adds an effect to the antipaladin's touch of corruption ability. Whenever the antipaladin uses touch of corruption to deal damage to one target, the target also receives the additional effect from one of the cruelties possessed by the antipaladin. This choice is made when the touch is used. The target receives a Fortitude save to avoid this cruelty. If the save is successful, the target takes the damage as normal, but not the effects of the cruelty. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the antipaladin's level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. At 3rd level, the antipaladin can select from the following initial cruelties.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Fatigued </i>: The target is fatigued.</li>
				<li><i>Shaken </i>: The target is shaken for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Sickened </i>: The target is sickened for 1 round per level of the antipaladin. At 6th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Dazed </i>: The target is dazed for 1 round.</li>
				<li><i>Diseased </i>: The target contracts a disease, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>contagion </i>, using his antipaladin level as his caster level.</li>
				<li><i>Staggered </i>: The target is staggered for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin. At 9th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Cursed </i>: The target is cursed, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>bestow curse </i>, using his antipaladin level as his caster level.</li>
				<li><i>Exhausted </i>: The target is exhausted. The antipaladin must have the fatigue cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Frightened </i>: The target is frightened for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the shaken cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Nauseated </i>: The target is nauseated for 1 round per three levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the sickened cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Poisoned </i>: The target is poisoned, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>poison </i>, using the antipaladin's level as the caster level. At 12th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Blinded </i>: The target is blinded for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Deafened </i>: The target is deafened for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Paralyzed </i>: The target is paralyzed for 1 round.</li>
				<li><i>Stunned </i>: The target is stunned for 1 round per four levels of the antipaladin. These abilities are not cumulative. For example, a 12th-level antipaladin's touch of corruption ability deals 6d6 points of damage and might also cause the target to become fatigued, dazed, poisoned, or diseased. Once a cruelty is chosen, it can't be changed.</li>
			</list>
			<p><b>Channel Negative Energy (Su) </b>: When an antipaladin reaches 4th level, he gains the supernatural ability to channel negative energy like a cleric. Using this ability consumes two uses of his touch of corruption ability. An antipaladin uses his level as his effective cleric level when channeling negative energy. This is a Charisma-based ability.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: Beginning at 4th level, an antipaladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells which are drawn from the antipaladin spell list presented in Chapter 5. An antipaladin must choose and prepare his spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, an antipaladin must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an antipaladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, an antipaladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is the same as that of a paladin and is given on Table 2-13. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-3 in the Core Rulebook). When Table 2-13 indicates that the antipaladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>An antipaladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. An antipaladin may prepare and cast any spell on the antipaladin spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, an antipaladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his antipaladin level -3.</p>
			<p><b>Corrupted Companion (Sp): </b>At 5th level, a blighted myrmidon can call upon a corrupted servant of nature. When the blighted myrmidon chooses the second fiendish boon option, it functions as a summon nature&#146;s ally spell of the appropriate level. This ability otherwise functions as the standard fiendish boon antipaladin class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Despair (Su) </b>: At 8th level, enemies within 10 feet of an antipaladin take a -2 penalty on all saving throws. This penalty does not stack with the penalty from aura of cowardice.</p>
			<p>This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Feed on Decay (Ex): </b>At 10th level, a blighted myrmidon draws strength from corrupting the natural world. When the blighted myrmidon damages a creature with her smite nature ability, she gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws for 1 round.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Decay (Su): </b>At 11th level, as a free action, a blighted myrmidon can expend two uses of her smite nature ability to generate an aura of decay with a range of 10 feet for 1 minute. Living foes of the blighted myrmidon within the aura take 3d6 points of damage unless they succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = half the blighted myrmidon&#146;s level + her Charisma modifier) for half damage. If an elemental, a fey, or a creature with levels in druid, hunter, ranger, or shifter takes damage from aura of decay, the blighted myrmidon regains a number of hit points equal to half the amount of damage the creature takes; this doesn&#146;t stack if multiple such creatures are in the aura.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Sin (Su) </b>: At 14th level, an antipaladin's weapons are treated as evil-aligned for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. Any attack made against an enemy within 10 feet of him is treated as evil-aligned for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Enervating Touch (Su): </b>At 15th level, when she damages a creature with her touch of corruption, a blighted myrmidon can suppress the vital force of her target for 1 round per level. While affected, when the target regains hit points, it regains only half the number of hit points it would otherwise receive, and it can&#146;t gain temporary hit points. The target can attempt a Fortitude save (DC = half the blighted myrmidon&#146;s level + her Charisma modifier) to negate this effect.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Depravity (Su) </b>: At 17th level, an antipaladin gains DR 5/good. Each enemy within 10 feet takes a -4 penalty on saving throws against compulsion effects. This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Unnatural Champion (Ex): </b>At 20th level, when a blighted myrmidon uses smite nature and strikes an elemental or fey creature with the extraplanar subtype, the target is also subject to the effects of a banishment spell, using her blighted myrmidon level as her caster level, and her weapon and unholy symbol automatically count as objects that the subject hates. This ability otherwise functions as unholy champion.</p>
			<p><b>Code of Conduct </b>: An antipaladin must be of chaotic evil alignment and loses all class features except proficiencies if he willingly and altruistically commits good acts. This does not mean that an antipaladin cannot take actions someone else might qualify as good, only that such actions must always be in service of his own dark ends. An antipaladin's code requires that he place his own interests and desires above all else, as well as impose tyranny, take advantage whenever possible, and punish the good and just, provided such actions don't interfere with his goals.</p>
			<p><b>Associates </b>: While he may adventure with evil or neutral allies, an antipaladin avoids working with good characters or with anyone who consistently attempts to do good deeds. Under exceptional circumstances, an antipaladin can ally with good associates, but only to defeat them from within and bring ruin to their ranks. An antipaladin does not need an atonement spell during such an unusual alliance as long as his nefarious goals are met in the end-evil cares only about results. An antipaladin may accept only henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are chaotic evil.</p>

				<name type="string">Fiendish Servant</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>The second type of bond allows an antipaladin to gain the service of a fiendish servant. This functions as <i>summon monster III </i>, except the duration is permanent and the antipaladin can only gain the service of a single creature and that creature must either have the chaotic and evil subtypes or it must be a fiendish animal. Once selected, the choice is set, but it may be changed whenever the antipaladin gains a level. Upon reaching 7th level, and every two levels thereafter, the level of the <i>summon monster </i>spell increases by one, to a maximum of <i>summon monster IX </i>at 17th level. Once per day, as a full-round action, an antipaladin may magically call his servant to his side. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the antipaladin's level. The servant immediately appears adjacent to the antipaladin. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels thereafter, for a total of four times per day at 17th level. At 11th level, the servant gains the advanced template (see the <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary </i>). At 15th level, an antipaladin's servant gains spell resistance equal to the antipaladin's level + 11. Should the antipaladin's fiendish servant die or be banished, the antipaladin may not summon another servant for 30 days or until he gains an antipaladin level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>

				<name type="string">Weapon Bond</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>The first type of bond allows the antipaladin to enhance his weapon as a standard action by calling upon the aid of a fiendish spirit for 1 minute per antipaladin level. When called, the spirit causes the weapon to shed unholy light as a torch. At 5th level, this spirit grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: <i>anarchic </i>, <i>flaming </i>, <i>flaming burst </i>, <i>keen </i>, <i>speed </i>, <i>unholy </i>, <i>vicious </i>, <i>vorpal </i>, and <i>wounding </i>. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table 15-9 in the <i>Core Rulebook </i>). These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The fiendish spirit imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than the antipaladin but resumes giving bonuses if returned to the antipaladin. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level. If a weapon bonded with a fiendish spirit is destroyed, the antipaladin loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until he gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, an antipaladin can select one cruelty. Each cruelty adds an effect to the antipaladin's touch of corruption ability.

					<p>Beginning at 4th level, an antipaladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells which are drawn from the antipaladin spell list presented in Chapter 5. An antipaladin must choose and prepare his spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, an antipaladin must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an antipaladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, an antipaladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is the same as that of a paladin and is given on Table 2-13. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-3 in the Core Rulebook). When Table 2-13 indicates that the antipaladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level. An antipaladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. An antipaladin may prepare and cast any spell on the antipaladin spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation. Through 3rd level, an antipaladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his antipaladin level -3.</p>

					<p>Beginning at 2nd level, an antipaladin surrounds his hand with a fiendish flame, causing terrible wounds to open on those he touches.

As a touch attack, an antipaladin can cause 1d6 points of damage for every two antipaladin levels he possesses. Using this ability is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Alternatively, an antipaladin can use this power to heal undead creatures, restoring 1d6 hit points for every two levels the antipaladin possesses. This ability is modified by any feat, spell, or effect that specifically works with the lay on hands paladin class feature.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>-</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although it is a rare occurrence, paladins do sometimes stray from the path of righteousness. Most of these wayward holy warriors seek out redemption and forgiveness for their misdeeds, regaining their powers through piety, charity, and powerful magic. Yet there are others, the dark and disturbed few, who turn actively to evil, courting the dark powers they once railed against in order to take vengeance on their former brothers. It's said that those who climb the farthest have the farthest to fall, and antipaladins are living proof of this fact, their pride and hatred blinding them to the glory of their forsaken patrons.</p>
			<p>Antipaladins become the antithesis of their former selves. They make pacts with fiends, take the lives of the innocent, and put nothing ahead of their personal power and wealth. Champions of evil, they often lead armies of evil creatures and work with other villains to bring ruin to the holy and tyranny to the weak. Not surprisingly, paladins stop at nothing to put an end to such nefarious antiheroes.</p>
			<p>The antipaladin is an alternate class. Making use of and altering numerous facets of the paladin core class, this villainous warrior can't truly be considered a new character class by its own right. By the changes made here, though, the details and tones of the paladin class are shifted in a completely opposite direction and captures an entirely different fantasy theme, without needlessly designing an entire new class. While a redesign of sorts, this alternate class can be used just as any of the other base classes found in the first part of this chapter.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: Antipaladins are villains at their most dangerous. They care nothing for the lives of others and actively seek to bring death and destruction to ordered society. They rarely travel with those that they do not subjugate, unless as part of a ruse to bring ruin from within.</p>
			<p>As an alternate paladin class, the antipaladin uses Table: Antipaladin to determine its base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, and spells per day. These details, along with the class's new special abilities, can be found on Table 2-13.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Chaotic evil.</p>
			<h>Ex-Antipaladins</h>
			<p>A antipaladin who ceases to be chaotic evil, who willfully commits an good act, or who violates the code of conduct loses all antipaladin spells and class features (including the fiendish boon, but not weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). He may not progress any further in levels as an antipaladin. He regains his abilities and advancement potential if he atones for his violations (see the <i>atonement </i>spell), as appropriate.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Antipaladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Evil (Ex) </b>: The power of an antipaladin's aura of evil (see the <i>detect evil </i>spell) is equal to his antipaladin level. A paladin who uses smite evil on an antipaladin deals 2 points of damage per paladin level on his first successful attack.</p>
			<p><b>Detect Good (Sp) </b>: At will, an antipaladin can use <i>detect good </i>, as the spell. An antipaladin can, as a move action, concentrate on a single item or individual within 60 feet and determine if it is good, learning the strength of its aura as if having studied it for 3 rounds. While focusing on one individual or object, the antipaladin does not detect good in any other object or individual within range.</p>
			<p><b>Smite Good (Su) </b>: Once per day, an antipaladin can call out to the dark powers to crush the forces of good. As a swift action, the antipaladin chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is good, the antipaladin adds his Charisma bonus (if any) on his attack rolls and adds his antipaladin level on all damage rolls made against the target of his smite. If the target of smite good is an outsider with the good subtype, a good-aligned dragon, or a good creature with levels of cleric or paladin, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per level the antipaladin possesses. Regardless of the target, smite good attacks automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess.</p>
			<p>In addition, while smite good is in effect, the antipaladin gains a deflection bonus equal to his Charisma modifier (if any) to his AC against attacks made by the target of the smite. If the antipaladin targets a creature that is not good, the smite is wasted with no effect.</p>
			<p>The smite good effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time the antipaladin rests and regains his uses of this ability. At 4th level, and at every three levels thereafter, the antipaladin may smite good one additional time per day, as indicated on Table 2-13, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Unholy Resilience (Su) </b>: At 2nd level, an antipaladin gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Touch of Corruption (Su) </b>: Beginning at 2nd level, an antipaladin surrounds his hand with a fiendish flame, causing terrible wounds to open on those he touches. Each day he can use this ability a number of times equal to 1/2 his antipaladin level + his Charisma modifier. As a touch attack, an antipaladin can cause 1d6 points of damage for every two antipaladin levels he possesses. Using this ability is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
			<p>Alternatively, an antipaladin can use this power to heal undead creatures, restoring 1d6 hit points for every two levels the antipaladin possesses. This ability is modified by any feat, spell, or effect that specifically works with the lay on hands paladin class feature. For example, the Extra Lay On Hands feat grants an antipaladin 2 additional uses of the touch of corruption class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Cowardice (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, an antipaladin radiates a palpably daunting aura that causes all enemies within 10 feet to take a -4 penalty on saving throws against fear effects. Creatures that are normally immune to fear lose that immunity while within 10 feet of an antipaladin with this ability. This ability functions only while the antipaladin remains conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Plague Bringer (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, the powers of darkness make an antipaladin a beacon of corruption and disease. An antipaladin does not take any damage or take any penalty from diseases. He can still contract diseases and spread them to others, but he is otherwise immune to their effects.</p>
			<p><b>Cruelty (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, an antipaladin can select one cruelty. Each cruelty adds an effect to the antipaladin's touch of corruption ability. Whenever the antipaladin uses touch of corruption to deal damage to one target, the target also receives the additional effect from one of the cruelties possessed by the antipaladin. This choice is made when the touch is used. The target receives a Fortitude save to avoid this cruelty. If the save is successful, the target takes the damage as normal, but not the effects of the cruelty. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the antipaladin's level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. At 3rd level, the antipaladin can select from the following initial cruelties.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Fatigued </i>: The target is fatigued.</li>
				<li><i>Shaken </i>: The target is shaken for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Sickened </i>: The target is sickened for 1 round per level of the antipaladin. At 6th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Dazed </i>: The target is dazed for 1 round.</li>
				<li><i>Diseased </i>: The target contracts a disease, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>contagion </i>, using his antipaladin level as his caster level.</li>
				<li><i>Staggered </i>: The target is staggered for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin. At 9th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Cursed </i>: The target is cursed, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>bestow curse </i>, using his antipaladin level as his caster level.</li>
				<li><i>Exhausted </i>: The target is exhausted. The antipaladin must have the fatigue cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Frightened </i>: The target is frightened for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the shaken cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Nauseated </i>: The target is nauseated for 1 round per three levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the sickened cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Poisoned </i>: The target is poisoned, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>poison </i>, using the antipaladin's level as the caster level. At 12th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Blinded </i>: The target is blinded for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Deafened </i>: The target is deafened for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Paralyzed </i>: The target is paralyzed for 1 round.</li>
				<li><i>Stunned </i>: The target is stunned for 1 round per four levels of the antipaladin. These abilities are not cumulative. For example, a 12th-level antipaladin's touch of corruption ability deals 6d6 points of damage and might also cause the target to become fatigued, dazed, poisoned, or diseased. Once a cruelty is chosen, it can't be changed.</li>
			</list>
			<p><b>Channel Negative Energy (Su) </b>: When an antipaladin reaches 4th level, he gains the supernatural ability to channel negative energy like a cleric. Using this ability consumes two uses of his touch of corruption ability. An antipaladin uses his level as his effective cleric level when channeling negative energy. This is a Charisma-based ability.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: Beginning at 4th level, an antipaladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells which are drawn from the antipaladin spell list presented in Chapter 5. An antipaladin must choose and prepare his spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, an antipaladin must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an antipaladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, an antipaladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is the same as that of a paladin and is given on Table 2-13. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-3 in the Core Rulebook). When Table 2-13 indicates that the antipaladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>An antipaladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. An antipaladin may prepare and cast any spell on the antipaladin spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, an antipaladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his antipaladin level -3.</p>
			<p><b>Fiendish Boon (Sp) </b>: Upon reaching 5th level, an antipaladin receives a boon from his dark patrons. This boon can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Bond </b>: The first type of bond allows the antipaladin to enhance his weapon as a standard action by calling upon the aid of a fiendish spirit for 1 minute per antipaladin level. When called, the spirit causes the weapon to shed unholy light as a torch. At 5th level, this spirit grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: <i>anarchic </i>, <i>flaming </i>, <i>flaming burst </i>, <i>keen </i>, <i>speed </i>, <i>unholy </i>, <i>vicious </i>, <i>vorpal </i>, and <i>wounding </i>. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table 15-9 in the <i>Core Rulebook </i>). These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The fiendish spirit imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than the antipaladin but resumes giving bonuses if returned to the antipaladin. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level.</p>
			<p>If a weapon bonded with a fiendish spirit is destroyed, the antipaladin loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until he gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>
			<p><b>Fiendish Servant </b>: The second type of bond allows an antipaladin to gain the service of a fiendish servant. This functions as <i>summon monster III </i>, except the duration is permanent and the antipaladin can only gain the service of a single creature and that creature must either have the chaotic and evil subtypes or it must be a fiendish animal. Once selected, the choice is set, but it may be changed whenever the antipaladin gains a level. Upon reaching 7th level, and every two levels thereafter, the level of the <i>summon monster </i>spell increases by one, to a maximum of <i>summon monster IX </i>at 17th level.</p>
			<p>Once per day, as a full-round action, an antipaladin may magically call his servant to his side. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the antipaladin's level. The servant immediately appears adjacent to the antipaladin. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels thereafter, for a total of four times per day at 17th level.</p>
			<p>At 11th level, the servant gains the advanced template (see the <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary </i>). At 15th level, an antipaladin's servant gains spell resistance equal to the antipaladin's level + 11.</p>
			<p>Should the antipaladin's fiendish servant die or be banished, the antipaladin may not summon another servant for 30 days or until he gains an antipaladin level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Despair (Su) </b>: At 8th level, enemies within 10 feet of an antipaladin take a -2 penalty on all saving throws. This penalty does not stack with the penalty from aura of cowardice.</p>
			<p>This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Vengeance (Su) </b>: At 11th level, an antipaladin can expend two uses of his smite good ability to grant the ability to smite good to all allies within 10 feet, using his bonuses. Allies must use this smite good ability by the start of the antipaladin's next turn and the bonuses last for 1 minute. Using this ability is a free action. Good creatures gain no benefit from this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Sin (Su) </b>: At 14th level, an antipaladin's weapons are treated as evil-aligned for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. Any attack made against an enemy within 10 feet of him is treated as evil-aligned for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Depravity (Su) </b>: At 17th level, an antipaladin gains DR 5/good. Each enemy within 10 feet takes a -4 penalty on saving throws against compulsion effects. This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Unholy Champion (Su) </b>: At 20th level, an antipaladin becomes a conduit for the might of the dark powers. His DR increases to 10/good. Whenever he uses smite good and successfully strikes an good outsider, the outsider is also subject to a <i>banishment </i>, using his antipaladin level as the caster level (his weapon and unholy symbol automatically count as objects that the subject hates). After the <i>banishment </i>effect and the damage from the attack is resolved, the smite immediately ends. In addition, whenever he channels negative energy or uses touch of corruption to damage a creature, he deals the maximum possible amount.</p>
			<p><b>Code of Conduct </b>: An antipaladin must be of chaotic evil alignment and loses all class features except proficiencies if he willingly and altruistically commits good acts. This does not mean that an antipaladin cannot take actions someone else might qualify as good, only that such actions must always be in service of his own dark ends. An antipaladin's code requires that he place his own interests and desires above all else, as well as impose tyranny, take advantage whenever possible, and punish the good and just, provided such actions don't interfere with his goals.</p>
			<p><b>Associates </b>: While he may adventure with evil or neutral allies, an antipaladin avoids working with good characters or with anyone who consistently attempts to do good deeds. Under exceptional circumstances, an antipaladin can ally with good associates, but only to defeat them from within and bring ruin to their ranks. An antipaladin does not need an atonement spell during such an unusual alliance as long as his nefarious goals are met in the end-evil cares only about results. An antipaladin may accept only henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are chaotic evil.</p>

					<p>Beginning at 4th level, an antipaladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells which are drawn from the antipaladin spell list presented in Chapter 5. An antipaladin must choose and prepare his spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, an antipaladin must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an antipaladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, an antipaladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is the same as that of a paladin and is given on Table 2-13. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-3 in the Core Rulebook). When Table 2-13 indicates that the antipaladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level. An antipaladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. An antipaladin may prepare and cast any spell on the antipaladin spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation. Through 3rd level, an antipaladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his antipaladin level -3.</p>

					<p>Beginning at 2nd level, an antipaladin surrounds his hand with a fiendish flame, causing terrible wounds to open on those he touches. Each day he can use this ability a number of times equal to 1/2 his antipaladin level + his Charisma modifier. As a touch attack, an antipaladin can cause 1d6 points of damage for every two antipaladin levels he possesses. Using this ability is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Alternatively, an antipaladin can use this power to heal undead creatures, restoring 1d6 hit points for every two levels the antipaladin possesses. This ability is modified by any feat, spell, or effect that specifically works with the lay on hands paladin class feature. For example, the Extra Lay On Hands feat grants an antipaladin 2 additional uses of the touch of corruption class feature.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Evil arises in every form imaginable, not just in hearts full of destruction and chaos. Tyrants are manipulative and lawful antipaladins, chess masters who arrange things behind the scenes to ensure that whatever happens, evil always wins, and the tyrant along with it. Unlike other antipaladins, tyrants are all too happy to associate with good creatures, the better to manipulate them into performing evil acts.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although it is a rare occurrence, paladins do sometimes stray from the path of righteousness. Most of these wayward holy warriors seek out redemption and forgiveness for their misdeeds, regaining their powers through piety, charity, and powerful magic. Yet there are others, the dark and disturbed few, who turn actively to evil, courting the dark powers they once railed against in order to take vengeance on their former brothers. It's said that those who climb the farthest have the farthest to fall, and antipaladins are living proof of this fact, their pride and hatred blinding them to the glory of their forsaken patrons.</p>
			<p>Antipaladins become the antithesis of their former selves. They make pacts with fiends, take the lives of the innocent, and put nothing ahead of their personal power and wealth. Champions of evil, they often lead armies of evil creatures and work with other villains to bring ruin to the holy and tyranny to the weak. Not surprisingly, paladins stop at nothing to put an end to such nefarious antiheroes.</p>
			<p>The antipaladin is an alternate class. Making use of and altering numerous facets of the paladin core class, this villainous warrior can't truly be considered a new character class by its own right. By the changes made here, though, the details and tones of the paladin class are shifted in a completely opposite direction and captures an entirely different fantasy theme, without needlessly designing an entire new class. While a redesign of sorts, this alternate class can be used just as any of the other base classes found in the first part of this chapter.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: Antipaladins are villains at their most dangerous. They care nothing for the lives of others and actively seek to bring death and destruction to ordered society. They rarely travel with those that they do not subjugate, unless as part of a ruse to bring ruin from within.</p>
			<p>As an alternate paladin class, the antipaladin uses Table: Antipaladin to determine its base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, and spells per day. These details, along with the class's new special abilities, can be found on Table 2-13.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Chaotic evil.</p>
			<h>Ex-Antipaladins</h>
			<p>A antipaladin who ceases to be chaotic evil, who willfully commits an good act, or who violates the code of conduct loses all antipaladin spells and class features (including the fiendish boon, but not weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). He may not progress any further in levels as an antipaladin. He regains his abilities and advancement potential if he atones for his violations (see the <i>atonement </i>spell), as appropriate.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Tyrant&#146;s Code: </b>A tyrant must be of lawful evil alignment and loses all class features except proficiencies if he willingly and altruistically commits good acts. This does not mean the tyrant can&#146;t take actions someone else might qualify as good, only that such actions must always be in service of his own dark ambitions. A tyrant&#146;s code requires that he place his own sinister goals above all else, respect rightful authority even as he twists its loopholes to his own ends, impose tyranny, and punish all those who dare dissent. A tyrant can accept underlings of any alignment; he cares not who serves him, only that they are truly loyal to him. He can even work alongside good-aligned individuals, as long as he is secretly manipulating them.</p>
			<p>This alters the antipaladin&#146;s code of conduct and associated abilities, as well as the section on ex-antipaladins.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Antipaladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Evil (Ex) </b>: The power of an antipaladin's aura of evil (see the <i>detect evil </i>spell) is equal to his antipaladin level. A paladin who uses smite evil on an antipaladin deals 2 points of damage per paladin level on his first successful attack.</p>
			<p><b>Detect Good (Sp) </b>: At will, an antipaladin can use <i>detect good </i>, as the spell. An antipaladin can, as a move action, concentrate on a single item or individual within 60 feet and determine if it is good, learning the strength of its aura as if having studied it for 3 rounds. While focusing on one individual or object, the antipaladin does not detect good in any other object or individual within range.</p>
			<p><b>Smite Good (Su) </b>: Once per day, an antipaladin can call out to the dark powers to crush the forces of good. As a swift action, the antipaladin chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is good, the antipaladin adds his Charisma bonus (if any) on his attack rolls and adds his antipaladin level on all damage rolls made against the target of his smite. If the target of smite good is an outsider with the good subtype, a good-aligned dragon, or a good creature with levels of cleric or paladin, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per level the antipaladin possesses. Regardless of the target, smite good attacks automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess.</p>
			<p>In addition, while smite good is in effect, the antipaladin gains a deflection bonus equal to his Charisma modifier (if any) to his AC against attacks made by the target of the smite. If the antipaladin targets a creature that is not good, the smite is wasted with no effect.</p>
			<p>The smite good effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time the antipaladin rests and regains his uses of this ability. At 4th level, and at every three levels thereafter, the antipaladin may smite good one additional time per day, as indicated on Table 2-13, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Unholy Resilience (Su) </b>: At 2nd level, an antipaladin gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Touch of Corruption (Su) </b>: Beginning at 2nd level, an antipaladin surrounds his hand with a fiendish flame, causing terrible wounds to open on those he touches. Each day he can use this ability a number of times equal to 1/2 his antipaladin level + his Charisma modifier. As a touch attack, an antipaladin can cause 1d6 points of damage for every two antipaladin levels he possesses. Using this ability is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
			<p>Alternatively, an antipaladin can use this power to heal undead creatures, restoring 1d6 hit points for every two levels the antipaladin possesses. This ability is modified by any feat, spell, or effect that specifically works with the lay on hands paladin class feature. For example, the Extra Lay On Hands feat grants an antipaladin 2 additional uses of the touch of corruption class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Cowardice (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, an antipaladin radiates a palpably daunting aura that causes all enemies within 10 feet to take a -4 penalty on saving throws against fear effects. Creatures that are normally immune to fear lose that immunity while within 10 feet of an antipaladin with this ability. This ability functions only while the antipaladin remains conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Plague Bringer (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, the powers of darkness make an antipaladin a beacon of corruption and disease. An antipaladin does not take any damage or take any penalty from diseases. He can still contract diseases and spread them to others, but he is otherwise immune to their effects.</p>
			<p><b>Cruelty (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, an antipaladin can select one cruelty. Each cruelty adds an effect to the antipaladin's touch of corruption ability. Whenever the antipaladin uses touch of corruption to deal damage to one target, the target also receives the additional effect from one of the cruelties possessed by the antipaladin. This choice is made when the touch is used. The target receives a Fortitude save to avoid this cruelty. If the save is successful, the target takes the damage as normal, but not the effects of the cruelty. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the antipaladin's level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. At 3rd level, the antipaladin can select from the following initial cruelties.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Fatigued </i>: The target is fatigued.</li>
				<li><i>Shaken </i>: The target is shaken for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Sickened </i>: The target is sickened for 1 round per level of the antipaladin. At 6th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Dazed </i>: The target is dazed for 1 round.</li>
				<li><i>Diseased </i>: The target contracts a disease, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>contagion </i>, using his antipaladin level as his caster level.</li>
				<li><i>Staggered </i>: The target is staggered for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin. At 9th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Cursed </i>: The target is cursed, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>bestow curse </i>, using his antipaladin level as his caster level.</li>
				<li><i>Exhausted </i>: The target is exhausted. The antipaladin must have the fatigue cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Frightened </i>: The target is frightened for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the shaken cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Nauseated </i>: The target is nauseated for 1 round per three levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the sickened cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Poisoned </i>: The target is poisoned, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>poison </i>, using the antipaladin's level as the caster level. At 12th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Blinded </i>: The target is blinded for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Deafened </i>: The target is deafened for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Paralyzed </i>: The target is paralyzed for 1 round.</li>
				<li><i>Stunned </i>: The target is stunned for 1 round per four levels of the antipaladin. These abilities are not cumulative. For example, a 12th-level antipaladin's touch of corruption ability deals 6d6 points of damage and might also cause the target to become fatigued, dazed, poisoned, or diseased. Once a cruelty is chosen, it can't be changed.</li>
			</list>
			<p><b>Channel Negative Energy (Su) </b>: When an antipaladin reaches 4th level, he gains the supernatural ability to channel negative energy like a cleric. Using this ability consumes two uses of his touch of corruption ability. An antipaladin uses his level as his effective cleric level when channeling negative energy. This is a Charisma-based ability.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: Beginning at 4th level, an antipaladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells which are drawn from the antipaladin spell list presented in Chapter 5. An antipaladin must choose and prepare his spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, an antipaladin must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an antipaladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, an antipaladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is the same as that of a paladin and is given on Table 2-13. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-3 in the Core Rulebook). When Table 2-13 indicates that the antipaladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>An antipaladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. An antipaladin may prepare and cast any spell on the antipaladin spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, an antipaladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his antipaladin level -3.</p>
			<p><b>Diabolic Boon (Sp): </b>At 5th level, if a tyrant chooses to gain the services of a fiendish servant with his fiendish boon ability, he must choose a fiendish animal or a creature with the lawful and evil subtypes.</p>
			<p>This ability alters fiendish boon..</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Bond </b>: The first type of bond allows the antipaladin to enhance his weapon as a standard action by calling upon the aid of a fiendish spirit for 1 minute per antipaladin level. When called, the spirit causes the weapon to shed unholy light as a torch. At 5th level, this spirit grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: <i>anarchic </i>, <i>flaming </i>, <i>flaming burst </i>, <i>keen </i>, <i>speed </i>, <i>unholy </i>, <i>vicious </i>, <i>vorpal </i>, and <i>wounding </i>. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table 15-9 in the <i>Core Rulebook </i>). These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The fiendish spirit imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than the antipaladin but resumes giving bonuses if returned to the antipaladin. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level.</p>
			<p>If a weapon bonded with a fiendish spirit is destroyed, the antipaladin loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until he gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>
			<p><b>Fiendish Servant </b>: The second type of bond allows an antipaladin to gain the service of a fiendish servant. This functions as <i>summon monster III </i>, except the duration is permanent and the antipaladin can only gain the service of a single creature and that creature must either have the chaotic and evil subtypes or it must be a fiendish animal. Once selected, the choice is set, but it may be changed whenever the antipaladin gains a level. Upon reaching 7th level, and every two levels thereafter, the level of the <i>summon monster </i>spell increases by one, to a maximum of <i>summon monster IX </i>at 17th level.</p>
			<p>Once per day, as a full-round action, an antipaladin may magically call his servant to his side. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the antipaladin's level. The servant immediately appears adjacent to the antipaladin. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels thereafter, for a total of four times per day at 17th level.</p>
			<p>At 11th level, the servant gains the advanced template (see the <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary </i>). At 15th level, an antipaladin's servant gains spell resistance equal to the antipaladin's level + 11.</p>
			<p>Should the antipaladin's fiendish servant die or be banished, the antipaladin may not summon another servant for 30 days or until he gains an antipaladin level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Despair (Su) </b>: At 8th level, enemies within 10 feet of an antipaladin take a -2 penalty on all saving throws. This penalty does not stack with the penalty from aura of cowardice.</p>
			<p>This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Vengeance (Su) </b>: At 11th level, an antipaladin can expend two uses of his smite good ability to grant the ability to smite good to all allies within 10 feet, using his bonuses. Allies must use this smite good ability by the start of the antipaladin's next turn and the bonuses last for 1 minute. Using this ability is a free action. Good creatures gain no benefit from this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Sin (Su) </b>: At 14th level, an antipaladin's weapons are treated as evil-aligned for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. Any attack made against an enemy within 10 feet of him is treated as evil-aligned for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Depravity (Su) </b>: At 17th level, an antipaladin gains DR 5/good. Each enemy within 10 feet takes a -4 penalty on saving throws against compulsion effects. This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Unholy Champion (Su) </b>: At 20th level, an antipaladin becomes a conduit for the might of the dark powers. His DR increases to 10/good. Whenever he uses smite good and successfully strikes an good outsider, the outsider is also subject to a <i>banishment </i>, using his antipaladin level as the caster level (his weapon and unholy symbol automatically count as objects that the subject hates). After the <i>banishment </i>effect and the damage from the attack is resolved, the smite immediately ends. In addition, whenever he channels negative energy or uses touch of corruption to damage a creature, he deals the maximum possible amount.</p>
			<p><b>Code of Conduct </b>: An antipaladin must be of chaotic evil alignment and loses all class features except proficiencies if he willingly and altruistically commits good acts. This does not mean that an antipaladin cannot take actions someone else might qualify as good, only that such actions must always be in service of his own dark ends. An antipaladin's code requires that he place his own interests and desires above all else, as well as impose tyranny, take advantage whenever possible, and punish the good and just, provided such actions don't interfere with his goals.</p>
			<p><b>Associates </b>: While he may adventure with evil or neutral allies, an antipaladin avoids working with good characters or with anyone who consistently attempts to do good deeds. Under exceptional circumstances, an antipaladin can ally with good associates, but only to defeat them from within and bring ruin to their ranks. An antipaladin does not need an atonement spell during such an unusual alliance as long as his nefarious goals are met in the end-evil cares only about results. An antipaladin may accept only henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are chaotic evil.</p>

					<p>Code of Conduct: The seal-breaker is dedicated to releasing the Whispering Tyrant from his prison. If a sealbreaker willingly and altruistically commits a good act, he loses all class features except proficiencies.

					<p>The second type of bond allows an antipaladin to gain the service of a fiendish servant. This functions as <i>summon monster III </i>, except the duration is permanent and the antipaladin can only gain the service of a single creature and that creature must either have the chaotic and evil subtypes or it must be a fiendish animal. Once selected, the choice is set, but it may be changed whenever the antipaladin gains a level. Upon reaching 7th level, and every two levels thereafter, the level of the <i>summon monster </i>spell increases by one, to a maximum of <i>summon monster IX </i>at 17th level. Once per day, as a full-round action, an antipaladin may magically call his servant to his side. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the antipaladin's level. The servant immediately appears adjacent to the antipaladin. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels thereafter, for a total of four times per day at 17th level. At 11th level, the servant gains the advanced template (see the <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary </i>). At 15th level, an antipaladin's servant gains spell resistance equal to the antipaladin's level + 11. Should the antipaladin's fiendish servant die or be banished, the antipaladin may not summon another servant for 30 days or until he gains an antipaladin level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>The first type of bond allows the antipaladin to enhance his weapon as a standard action by calling upon the aid of a fiendish spirit for 1 minute per antipaladin level. When called, the spirit causes the weapon to shed unholy light as a torch. At 5th level, this spirit grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: <i>anarchic </i>, <i>flaming </i>, <i>flaming burst </i>, <i>keen </i>, <i>speed </i>, <i>unholy </i>, <i>vicious </i>, <i>vorpal </i>, and <i>wounding </i>. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table 15-9 in the <i>Core Rulebook </i>). These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The fiendish spirit imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than the antipaladin but resumes giving bonuses if returned to the antipaladin. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level. If a weapon bonded with a fiendish spirit is destroyed, the antipaladin loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until he gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>

						<li><i>Diseased </i>: The target contracts a disease, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>contagion </i>, using his antipaladin level as his caster level.</li>

					<p>At will, an antipaladin can use <i>detect good </i>, as the spell. An antipaladin can, as a move action, concentrate on a single item or individual within 60 feet and determine if it is good, learning the strength of its aura as if having studied it for 3 rounds. While focusing on one individual or object, the antipaladin does not detect good in any other object or individual within range.</p>

					<p>Upon reaching 5th level, a sealbreaker receives a boon from beyond the grave. This boon can take one of two forms: the seal-breaker can choose to form a bond with his weapon, or he can choose to animate an undead mount to ride.</p>
					<p>If a bonded weapon is selected, this ability works exactly like the antipaladin&#146;s fiendish boon ability.</p>
					<p>If the undead mount ability is selected, the sealbreaker gains the ability to reanimate any Large corpse (or a Medium corpse for Small seal-breakers) as his corpse mount. If no such corpse is present, the seal-breaker cannot summon his mount. The corpse animates as a quadruped of the same size that the seal-breaker can ride, regardless of the corpse&#146;s living form. This corpse mount functions as a druid&#146;s animal companion using the seal-breaker&#146;s level as his effective druid level. The mount has the same base statistics as a heavy horse, pony, boar, camel, or dog (based on its size) with the following changes: its type changes to undead, it has a good Will save and bad Fortitude and Reflex saves, it uses the base creature&#146;s Constitution score as its Charisma score (and likewise applies all level-based advancements to Charisma instead of Constitution), and it has an Intelligence score of at least 6. This ability otherwise functions as and replaces fiendish boon.</p>

					<p>Beginning at 4th level, an antipaladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells which are drawn from the antipaladin spell list presented in Chapter 5. An antipaladin must choose and prepare his spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, an antipaladin must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an antipaladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, an antipaladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is the same as that of a paladin and is given on Table 2-13. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-3 in the Core Rulebook). When Table 2-13 indicates that the antipaladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level. An antipaladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. An antipaladin may prepare and cast any spell on the antipaladin spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation. Through 3rd level, an antipaladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his antipaladin level -3.</p>

					<p>Beginning at 2nd level, an antipaladin surrounds his hand with a fiendish flame, causing terrible wounds to open on those he touches. Each day he can use this ability a number of times equal to 1/2 his antipaladin level + his Charisma modifier. As a touch attack, an antipaladin can cause 1d6 points of damage for every two antipaladin levels he possesses. Using this ability is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Alternatively, an antipaladin can use this power to heal undead creatures, restoring 1d6 hit points for every two levels the antipaladin possesses. This ability is modified by any feat, spell, or effect that specifically works with the lay on hands paladin class feature. For example, the Extra Lay On Hands feat grants an antipaladin 2 additional uses of the touch of corruption class feature.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Seal-breakers are dedicated to the Whispering Tyrant and have tasked themselves with finding and destroying the seals that bind him within Gallowspire. Their ties to the Whispering Tyrant give them power over undead creatures and other dark forces.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although it is a rare occurrence, paladins do sometimes stray from the path of righteousness. Most of these wayward holy warriors seek out redemption and forgiveness for their misdeeds, regaining their powers through piety, charity, and powerful magic. Yet there are others, the dark and disturbed few, who turn actively to evil, courting the dark powers they once railed against in order to take vengeance on their former brothers. It's said that those who climb the farthest have the farthest to fall, and antipaladins are living proof of this fact, their pride and hatred blinding them to the glory of their forsaken patrons.</p>
			<p>Antipaladins become the antithesis of their former selves. They make pacts with fiends, take the lives of the innocent, and put nothing ahead of their personal power and wealth. Champions of evil, they often lead armies of evil creatures and work with other villains to bring ruin to the holy and tyranny to the weak. Not surprisingly, paladins stop at nothing to put an end to such nefarious antiheroes.</p>
			<p>The antipaladin is an alternate class. Making use of and altering numerous facets of the paladin core class, this villainous warrior can't truly be considered a new character class by its own right. By the changes made here, though, the details and tones of the paladin class are shifted in a completely opposite direction and captures an entirely different fantasy theme, without needlessly designing an entire new class. While a redesign of sorts, this alternate class can be used just as any of the other base classes found in the first part of this chapter.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: Antipaladins are villains at their most dangerous. They care nothing for the lives of others and actively seek to bring death and destruction to ordered society. They rarely travel with those that they do not subjugate, unless as part of a ruse to bring ruin from within.</p>
			<p>As an alternate paladin class, the antipaladin uses Table: Antipaladin to determine its base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, and spells per day. These details, along with the class's new special abilities, can be found on Table 2-13.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Chaotic evil.</p>
			<h>Ex-Antipaladins</h>
			<p>A antipaladin who ceases to be chaotic evil, who willfully commits an good act, or who violates the code of conduct loses all antipaladin spells and class features (including the fiendish boon, but not weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). He may not progress any further in levels as an antipaladin. He regains his abilities and advancement potential if he atones for his violations (see the <i>atonement </i>spell), as appropriate.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Antipaladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Evil (Ex) </b>: The power of an antipaladin's aura of evil (see the <i>detect evil </i>spell) is equal to his antipaladin level. A paladin who uses smite evil on an antipaladin deals 2 points of damage per paladin level on his first successful attack.</p>
			<p><b>Detect Good (Sp) </b>: At will, an antipaladin can use <i>detect good </i>, as the spell. An antipaladin can, as a move action, concentrate on a single item or individual within 60 feet and determine if it is good, learning the strength of its aura as if having studied it for 3 rounds. While focusing on one individual or object, the antipaladin does not detect good in any other object or individual within range.</p>
			<p><b>Smite Good (Su) </b>: Once per day, an antipaladin can call out to the dark powers to crush the forces of good. As a swift action, the antipaladin chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is good, the antipaladin adds his Charisma bonus (if any) on his attack rolls and adds his antipaladin level on all damage rolls made against the target of his smite. If the target of smite good is an outsider with the good subtype, a good-aligned dragon, or a good creature with levels of cleric or paladin, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per level the antipaladin possesses. Regardless of the target, smite good attacks automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess.</p>
			<p>In addition, while smite good is in effect, the antipaladin gains a deflection bonus equal to his Charisma modifier (if any) to his AC against attacks made by the target of the smite. If the antipaladin targets a creature that is not good, the smite is wasted with no effect.</p>
			<p>The smite good effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time the antipaladin rests and regains his uses of this ability. At 4th level, and at every three levels thereafter, the antipaladin may smite good one additional time per day, as indicated on Table 2-13, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Unholy Resilience (Su) </b>: At 2nd level, an antipaladin gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Touch of Corruption (Su) </b>: Beginning at 2nd level, an antipaladin surrounds his hand with a fiendish flame, causing terrible wounds to open on those he touches. Each day he can use this ability a number of times equal to 1/2 his antipaladin level + his Charisma modifier. As a touch attack, an antipaladin can cause 1d6 points of damage for every two antipaladin levels he possesses. Using this ability is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
			<p>Alternatively, an antipaladin can use this power to heal undead creatures, restoring 1d6 hit points for every two levels the antipaladin possesses. This ability is modified by any feat, spell, or effect that specifically works with the lay on hands paladin class feature. For example, the Extra Lay On Hands feat grants an antipaladin 2 additional uses of the touch of corruption class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of the Grave (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a seal-breaker is constantly surrounded by the chill of death. Mindless undead within 10 feet of the seal-breaker will not attack him unless directly ordered to, and even then only after succeeding at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the seal-breaker&#146;s level + his Charisma modifier). This ability replaces aura of cowardice.</p>
			<p><b>Plague Bringer (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, the powers of darkness make an antipaladin a beacon of corruption and disease. An antipaladin does not take any damage or take any penalty from diseases. He can still contract diseases and spread them to others, but he is otherwise immune to their effects.</p>
			<p><b>Cruelty (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, an antipaladin can select one cruelty. Each cruelty adds an effect to the antipaladin's touch of corruption ability. Whenever the antipaladin uses touch of corruption to deal damage to one target, the target also receives the additional effect from one of the cruelties possessed by the antipaladin. This choice is made when the touch is used. The target receives a Fortitude save to avoid this cruelty. If the save is successful, the target takes the damage as normal, but not the effects of the cruelty. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the antipaladin's level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. At 3rd level, the antipaladin can select from the following initial cruelties.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Fatigued </i>: The target is fatigued.</li>
				<li><i>Shaken </i>: The target is shaken for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Sickened </i>: The target is sickened for 1 round per level of the antipaladin. At 6th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Dazed </i>: The target is dazed for 1 round.</li>
				<li><i>Diseased </i>: The target contracts a disease, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>contagion </i>, using his antipaladin level as his caster level.</li>
				<li><i>Staggered </i>: The target is staggered for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin. At 9th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Cursed </i>: The target is cursed, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>bestow curse </i>, using his antipaladin level as his caster level.</li>
				<li><i>Exhausted </i>: The target is exhausted. The antipaladin must have the fatigue cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Frightened </i>: The target is frightened for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the shaken cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Nauseated </i>: The target is nauseated for 1 round per three levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the sickened cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Poisoned </i>: The target is poisoned, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>poison </i>, using the antipaladin's level as the caster level. At 12th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Blinded </i>: The target is blinded for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Deafened </i>: The target is deafened for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Paralyzed </i>: The target is paralyzed for 1 round.</li>
				<li><i>Stunned </i>: The target is stunned for 1 round per four levels of the antipaladin. These abilities are not cumulative. For example, a 12th-level antipaladin's touch of corruption ability deals 6d6 points of damage and might also cause the target to become fatigued, dazed, poisoned, or diseased. Once a cruelty is chosen, it can't be changed.</li>
			</list>
			<p><b>Channel Negative Energy (Su) </b>: When an antipaladin reaches 4th level, he gains the supernatural ability to channel negative energy like a cleric. Using this ability consumes two uses of his touch of corruption ability. An antipaladin uses his level as his effective cleric level when channeling negative energy. This is a Charisma-based ability.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: Beginning at 4th level, an antipaladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells which are drawn from the antipaladin spell list presented in Chapter 5. An antipaladin must choose and prepare his spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, an antipaladin must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an antipaladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, an antipaladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is the same as that of a paladin and is given on Table 2-13. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-3 in the Core Rulebook). When Table 2-13 indicates that the antipaladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>An antipaladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. An antipaladin may prepare and cast any spell on the antipaladin spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, an antipaladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his antipaladin level -3.</p>
			<p><b>Corpse Rider (Su): </b>Upon reaching 5th level, a sealbreaker receives a boon from beyond the grave. This boon can take one of two forms: the seal-breaker can choose to form a bond with his weapon, or he can choose to animate an undead mount to ride.</p>
			<p>If a bonded weapon is selected, this ability works exactly like the antipaladin&#146;s fiendish boon ability.</p>
			<p>If the undead mount ability is selected, the sealbreaker gains the ability to reanimate any Large corpse (or a Medium corpse for Small seal-breakers) as his corpse mount. If no such corpse is present, the seal-breaker cannot summon his mount. The corpse animates as a quadruped of the same size that the seal-breaker can ride, regardless of the corpse&#146;s living form. This corpse mount functions as a druid&#146;s animal companion using the seal-breaker&#146;s level as his effective druid level. The mount has the same base statistics as a heavy horse, pony, boar, camel, or dog (based on its size) with the following changes: its type changes to undead, it has a good Will save and bad Fortitude and Reflex saves, it uses the base creature&#146;s Constitution score as its Charisma score (and likewise applies all level-based advancements to Charisma instead of Constitution), and it has an Intelligence score of at least 6. This ability otherwise functions as and replaces fiendish boon.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Death (Su): </b>At 8th level, a seal-breaker radiates an aura that causes undead creatures within 10 feet to gain a +2 profane bonus on all saving throws. This ability replaces aura of despair.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Rebirth (Su): </b>At 11th level, if a living creature is slain within 10 feet of the seal-breaker, the seal-breaker can spend two uses of his smite good ability at the start of his next turn as a standard action to summon the spirit of a dead murderer to reanimate the corpse as a mohrg. The mohrg immediately rises and attacks the seal breaker&#146;s foes, acting under the antipaladin&#146;s command. After 1 minute, the murderer&#146;s soul leaves the body, which collapses, again lifeless. At 15th level, the seal-breaker can activate this ability as a move action. At 19th level, he can activate this ability as a swift action. This ability replaces aura of vengeance.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Sin (Su) </b>: At 14th level, an antipaladin's weapons are treated as evil-aligned for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. Any attack made against an enemy within 10 feet of him is treated as evil-aligned for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Depravity (Su) </b>: At 17th level, an antipaladin gains DR 5/good. Each enemy within 10 feet takes a -4 penalty on saving throws against compulsion effects. This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Unholy Champion (Su) </b>: At 20th level, an antipaladin becomes a conduit for the might of the dark powers. His DR increases to 10/good. Whenever he uses smite good and successfully strikes an good outsider, the outsider is also subject to a <i>banishment </i>, using his antipaladin level as the caster level (his weapon and unholy symbol automatically count as objects that the subject hates). After the <i>banishment </i>effect and the damage from the attack is resolved, the smite immediately ends. In addition, whenever he channels negative energy or uses touch of corruption to damage a creature, he deals the maximum possible amount.</p>
			<p><b>Code of Conduct </b>: An antipaladin must be of chaotic evil alignment and loses all class features except proficiencies if he willingly and altruistically commits good acts. This does not mean that an antipaladin cannot take actions someone else might qualify as good, only that such actions must always be in service of his own dark ends. An antipaladin's code requires that he place his own interests and desires above all else, as well as impose tyranny, take advantage whenever possible, and punish the good and just, provided such actions don't interfere with his goals.</p>
			<p><b>Associates </b>: While he may adventure with evil or neutral allies, an antipaladin avoids working with good characters or with anyone who consistently attempts to do good deeds. Under exceptional circumstances, an antipaladin can ally with good associates, but only to defeat them from within and bring ruin to their ranks. An antipaladin does not need an atonement spell during such an unusual alliance as long as his nefarious goals are met in the end-evil cares only about results. An antipaladin may accept only henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are chaotic evil.</p>

				<level type="number">1</level>
				<name type="string">Fiendish Servant</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>The second type of bond allows an antipaladin to gain the service of a fiendish servant. This functions as <i>summon monster III </i>, except the duration is permanent and the antipaladin can only gain the service of a single creature and that creature must either have the chaotic and evil subtypes or it must be a fiendish animal. Once selected, the choice is set, but it may be changed whenever the antipaladin gains a level. Upon reaching 7th level, and every two levels thereafter, the level of the <i>summon monster </i>spell increases by one, to a maximum of <i>summon monster IX </i>at 17th level. Once per day, as a full-round action, an antipaladin may magically call his servant to his side. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the antipaladin's level. The servant immediately appears adjacent to the antipaladin. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels thereafter, for a total of four times per day at 17th level. At 11th level, the servant gains the advanced template (see the <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary </i>). At 15th level, an antipaladin's servant gains spell resistance equal to the antipaladin's level + 11. Should the antipaladin's fiendish servant die or be banished, the antipaladin may not summon another servant for 30 days or until he gains an antipaladin level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>

				<name type="string">Weapon Bond</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>The first type of bond allows the antipaladin to enhance his weapon as a standard action by calling upon the aid of a fiendish spirit for 1 minute per antipaladin level. When called, the spirit causes the weapon to shed unholy light as a torch. At 5th level, this spirit grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: <i>anarchic </i>, <i>flaming </i>, <i>flaming burst </i>, <i>keen </i>, <i>speed </i>, <i>unholy </i>, <i>vicious </i>, <i>vorpal </i>, and <i>wounding </i>. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table 15-9 in the <i>Core Rulebook </i>). These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The fiendish spirit imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than the antipaladin but resumes giving bonuses if returned to the antipaladin. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level. If a weapon bonded with a fiendish spirit is destroyed, the antipaladin loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until he gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>

					<p>Beginning at 4th level, an antipaladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells which are drawn from the antipaladin spell list presented in Chapter 5. An antipaladin must choose and prepare his spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, an antipaladin must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an antipaladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, an antipaladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is the same as that of a paladin and is given on Table 2-13. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-3 in the Core Rulebook). When Table 2-13 indicates that the antipaladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level. An antipaladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. An antipaladin may prepare and cast any spell on the antipaladin spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation. Through 3rd level, an antipaladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his antipaladin level -3.</p>

					<p>Beginning at 2nd level, an antipaladin surrounds his hand with a fiendish flame, causing terrible wounds to open on those he touches. Each day he can use this ability a number of times equal to 1/2 his antipaladin level + his Charisma modifier. As a touch attack, an antipaladin can cause 1d6 points of damage for every two antipaladin levels he possesses. Using this ability is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Alternatively, an antipaladin can use this power to heal undead creatures, restoring 1d6 hit points for every two levels the antipaladin possesses. This ability is modified by any feat, spell, or effect that specifically works with the lay on hands paladin class feature. For example, the Extra Lay On Hands feat grants an antipaladin 2 additional uses of the touch of corruption class feature.</p>

Whenever he uses smite good and successfully strikes an good outsider, the outsider is also subject to a <i>banishment </i>, using his antipaladin level as the caster level (his weapon and unholy symbol automatically count as objects that the subject hates). After the <i>banishment </i>effect and the damage from the attack is resolved, the smite immediately ends.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Rough rampagers venerate Rovagug, reveling in the destruction the dark god represents. Where others seek power, wealth, or revenge, the rough rampager merely focuses on slaughter and mayhem. Because of their sheer destructive nature, most rough rampagers live short, brutal lives swathed in blood and carnage before someone puts them to the blade. Legends speak of dozens of rough rampagers wreaking havoc when Rovagug&#146;s spawn escape, acting as heralds and harbingers of the greater destruction created by the Rough Beast&#146;s terrifying children.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although it is a rare occurrence, paladins do sometimes stray from the path of righteousness. Most of these wayward holy warriors seek out redemption and forgiveness for their misdeeds, regaining their powers through piety, charity, and powerful magic. Yet there are others, the dark and disturbed few, who turn actively to evil, courting the dark powers they once railed against in order to take vengeance on their former brothers. It's said that those who climb the farthest have the farthest to fall, and antipaladins are living proof of this fact, their pride and hatred blinding them to the glory of their forsaken patrons.</p>
			<p>Antipaladins become the antithesis of their former selves. They make pacts with fiends, take the lives of the innocent, and put nothing ahead of their personal power and wealth. Champions of evil, they often lead armies of evil creatures and work with other villains to bring ruin to the holy and tyranny to the weak. Not surprisingly, paladins stop at nothing to put an end to such nefarious antiheroes.</p>
			<p>The antipaladin is an alternate class. Making use of and altering numerous facets of the paladin core class, this villainous warrior can't truly be considered a new character class by its own right. By the changes made here, though, the details and tones of the paladin class are shifted in a completely opposite direction and captures an entirely different fantasy theme, without needlessly designing an entire new class. While a redesign of sorts, this alternate class can be used just as any of the other base classes found in the first part of this chapter.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: Antipaladins are villains at their most dangerous. They care nothing for the lives of others and actively seek to bring death and destruction to ordered society. They rarely travel with those that they do not subjugate, unless as part of a ruse to bring ruin from within.</p>
			<p>As an alternate paladin class, the antipaladin uses Table: Antipaladin to determine its base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, and spells per day. These details, along with the class's new special abilities, can be found on Table 2-13.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Chaotic evil.</p>
			<h>Ex-Antipaladins</h>
			<p>A antipaladin who ceases to be chaotic evil, who willfully commits an good act, or who violates the code of conduct loses all antipaladin spells and class features (including the fiendish boon, but not weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). He may not progress any further in levels as an antipaladin. He regains his abilities and advancement potential if he atones for his violations (see the <i>atonement </i>spell), as appropriate.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Antipaladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Evil (Ex) </b>: The power of an antipaladin's aura of evil (see the <i>detect evil </i>spell) is equal to his antipaladin level. A paladin who uses smite evil on an antipaladin deals 2 points of damage per paladin level on his first successful attack.</p>
			<p><b>Detect Good (Sp) </b>: At will, an antipaladin can use <i>detect good </i>, as the spell. An antipaladin can, as a move action, concentrate on a single item or individual within 60 feet and determine if it is good, learning the strength of its aura as if having studied it for 3 rounds. While focusing on one individual or object, the antipaladin does not detect good in any other object or individual within range.</p>
			<p><b>Smite Good (Su) </b>: Once per day, an antipaladin can call out to the dark powers to crush the forces of good. As a swift action, the antipaladin chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is good, the antipaladin adds his Charisma bonus (if any) on his attack rolls and adds his antipaladin level on all damage rolls made against the target of his smite. If the target of smite good is an outsider with the good subtype, a good-aligned dragon, or a good creature with levels of cleric or paladin, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per level the antipaladin possesses. Regardless of the target, smite good attacks automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess.</p>
			<p>In addition, while smite good is in effect, the antipaladin gains a deflection bonus equal to his Charisma modifier (if any) to his AC against attacks made by the target of the smite. If the antipaladin targets a creature that is not good, the smite is wasted with no effect.</p>
			<p>The smite good effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time the antipaladin rests and regains his uses of this ability. At 4th level, and at every three levels thereafter, the antipaladin may smite good one additional time per day, as indicated on Table 2-13, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Unholy Resilience (Su) </b>: At 2nd level, an antipaladin gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Touch of Corruption (Su) </b>: Beginning at 2nd level, an antipaladin surrounds his hand with a fiendish flame, causing terrible wounds to open on those he touches. Each day he can use this ability a number of times equal to 1/2 his antipaladin level + his Charisma modifier. As a touch attack, an antipaladin can cause 1d6 points of damage for every two antipaladin levels he possesses. Using this ability is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
			<p>Alternatively, an antipaladin can use this power to heal undead creatures, restoring 1d6 hit points for every two levels the antipaladin possesses. This ability is modified by any feat, spell, or effect that specifically works with the lay on hands paladin class feature. For example, the Extra Lay On Hands feat grants an antipaladin 2 additional uses of the touch of corruption class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Blood (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a rough rampager radiates a palpably daunting aura that causes all enemies within 10 feet to take a &#150;4 penalty on Constitution or Heal checks to stop bleed damage and checks to stabilize while dying. This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious. This ability replaces aura of cowardice.</p>
			<p><b>Plague Bringer (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, the powers of darkness make an antipaladin a beacon of corruption and disease. An antipaladin does not take any damage or take any penalty from diseases. He can still contract diseases and spread them to others, but he is otherwise immune to their effects.</p>
			<p><b>Cruelty (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, an antipaladin can select one cruelty. Each cruelty adds an effect to the antipaladin's touch of corruption ability. Whenever the antipaladin uses touch of corruption to deal damage to one target, the target also receives the additional effect from one of the cruelties possessed by the antipaladin. This choice is made when the touch is used. The target receives a Fortitude save to avoid this cruelty. If the save is successful, the target takes the damage as normal, but not the effects of the cruelty. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the antipaladin's level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. At 3rd level, the antipaladin can select from the following initial cruelties.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Fatigued </i>: The target is fatigued.</li>
				<li><i>Shaken </i>: The target is shaken for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Sickened </i>: The target is sickened for 1 round per level of the antipaladin. At 6th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Dazed </i>: The target is dazed for 1 round.</li>
				<li><i>Diseased </i>: The target contracts a disease, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>contagion </i>, using his antipaladin level as his caster level.</li>
				<li><i>Staggered </i>: The target is staggered for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin. At 9th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Cursed </i>: The target is cursed, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>bestow curse </i>, using his antipaladin level as his caster level.</li>
				<li><i>Exhausted </i>: The target is exhausted. The antipaladin must have the fatigue cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Frightened </i>: The target is frightened for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the shaken cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Nauseated </i>: The target is nauseated for 1 round per three levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the sickened cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Poisoned </i>: The target is poisoned, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>poison </i>, using the antipaladin's level as the caster level. At 12th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Blinded </i>: The target is blinded for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Deafened </i>: The target is deafened for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Paralyzed </i>: The target is paralyzed for 1 round.</li>
				<li><i>Stunned </i>: The target is stunned for 1 round per four levels of the antipaladin. These abilities are not cumulative. For example, a 12th-level antipaladin's touch of corruption ability deals 6d6 points of damage and might also cause the target to become fatigued, dazed, poisoned, or diseased. Once a cruelty is chosen, it can't be changed.</li>
			</list>
			<p><b>Channel Negative Energy (Su) </b>: When an antipaladin reaches 4th level, he gains the supernatural ability to channel negative energy like a cleric. Using this ability consumes two uses of his touch of corruption ability. An antipaladin uses his level as his effective cleric level when channeling negative energy. This is a Charisma-based ability.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: Beginning at 4th level, an antipaladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells which are drawn from the antipaladin spell list presented in Chapter 5. An antipaladin must choose and prepare his spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, an antipaladin must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an antipaladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, an antipaladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is the same as that of a paladin and is given on Table 2-13. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-3 in the Core Rulebook). When Table 2-13 indicates that the antipaladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>An antipaladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. An antipaladin may prepare and cast any spell on the antipaladin spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, an antipaladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his antipaladin level -3.</p>
			<p><b>Fiendish Boon (Sp) </b>: Upon reaching 5th level, an antipaladin receives a boon from his dark patrons. This boon can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Bond </b>: The first type of bond allows the antipaladin to enhance his weapon as a standard action by calling upon the aid of a fiendish spirit for 1 minute per antipaladin level. When called, the spirit causes the weapon to shed unholy light as a torch. At 5th level, this spirit grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: <i>anarchic </i>, <i>flaming </i>, <i>flaming burst </i>, <i>keen </i>, <i>speed </i>, <i>unholy </i>, <i>vicious </i>, <i>vorpal </i>, and <i>wounding </i>. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table 15-9 in the <i>Core Rulebook </i>). These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The fiendish spirit imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than the antipaladin but resumes giving bonuses if returned to the antipaladin. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level.</p>
			<p>If a weapon bonded with a fiendish spirit is destroyed, the antipaladin loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until he gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>
			<p><b>Fiendish Servant </b>: The second type of bond allows an antipaladin to gain the service of a fiendish servant. This functions as <i>summon monster III </i>, except the duration is permanent and the antipaladin can only gain the service of a single creature and that creature must either have the chaotic and evil subtypes or it must be a fiendish animal. Once selected, the choice is set, but it may be changed whenever the antipaladin gains a level. Upon reaching 7th level, and every two levels thereafter, the level of the <i>summon monster </i>spell increases by one, to a maximum of <i>summon monster IX </i>at 17th level.</p>
			<p>Once per day, as a full-round action, an antipaladin may magically call his servant to his side. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the antipaladin's level. The servant immediately appears adjacent to the antipaladin. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels thereafter, for a total of four times per day at 17th level.</p>
			<p>At 11th level, the servant gains the advanced template (see the <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary </i>). At 15th level, an antipaladin's servant gains spell resistance equal to the antipaladin's level + 11.</p>
			<p>Should the antipaladin's fiendish servant die or be banished, the antipaladin may not summon another servant for 30 days or until he gains an antipaladin level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Putrefaction (Su): </b>At 8th level, a rough rampager radiates an aura that causes the wounds of enemies within 10 feet to weep blood. Injured enemies in the area take 1 point of bleed damage per round. This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious. This ability replaces aura of despair.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Vengeance (Su) </b>: At 11th level, an antipaladin can expend two uses of his smite good ability to grant the ability to smite good to all allies within 10 feet, using his bonuses. Allies must use this smite good ability by the start of the antipaladin's next turn and the bonuses last for 1 minute. Using this ability is a free action. Good creatures gain no benefit from this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Quietus (Su): </b>At 14th level, a rough rampager radiates an aura that causes the failure of healing spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities used to restore enemies within 10 feet of him. This is not an antimagic field, however, and ongoing or passive effects are not affected. Casters can overcome this ability with a successful caster level check versus the rough rampager&#146;s class level + 11. This ability replaces aura of sin.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Depravity (Su) </b>: At 17th level, an antipaladin gains DR 5/good. Each enemy within 10 feet takes a -4 penalty on saving throws against compulsion effects. This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Unholy Champion (Su) </b>: At 20th level, an antipaladin becomes a conduit for the might of the dark powers. His DR increases to 10/good. Whenever he uses smite good and successfully strikes an good outsider, the outsider is also subject to a <i>banishment </i>, using his antipaladin level as the caster level (his weapon and unholy symbol automatically count as objects that the subject hates). After the <i>banishment </i>effect and the damage from the attack is resolved, the smite immediately ends. In addition, whenever he channels negative energy or uses touch of corruption to damage a creature, he deals the maximum possible amount.</p>
			<p><b>Code of Conduct </b>: An antipaladin must be of chaotic evil alignment and loses all class features except proficiencies if he willingly and altruistically commits good acts. This does not mean that an antipaladin cannot take actions someone else might qualify as good, only that such actions must always be in service of his own dark ends. An antipaladin's code requires that he place his own interests and desires above all else, as well as impose tyranny, take advantage whenever possible, and punish the good and just, provided such actions don't interfere with his goals.</p>
			<p><b>Associates </b>: While he may adventure with evil or neutral allies, an antipaladin avoids working with good characters or with anyone who consistently attempts to do good deeds. Under exceptional circumstances, an antipaladin can ally with good associates, but only to defeat them from within and bring ruin to their ranks. An antipaladin does not need an atonement spell during such an unusual alliance as long as his nefarious goals are met in the end-evil cares only about results. An antipaladin may accept only henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are chaotic evil.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>The first type of bond allows the antipaladin to enhance his weapon as a standard action by calling upon the aid of a fiendish spirit for 1 minute per antipaladin level. When called, the spirit causes the weapon to shed unholy light as a torch. At 5th level, this spirit grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: <i>anarchic </i>, <i>flaming </i>, <i>flaming burst </i>, <i>keen </i>, <i>speed </i>, <i>unholy </i>, <i>vicious </i>, <i>vorpal </i>, and <i>wounding </i>. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table 15-9 in the <i>Core Rulebook </i>). These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The fiendish spirit imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than the antipaladin but resumes giving bonuses if returned to the antipaladin. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level. If a weapon bonded with a fiendish spirit is destroyed, the antipaladin loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until he gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Not content with the antipaladin&#146;s mere corruption of the soul, the knight of the sepulcher sacrifices mortality along with morality.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although it is a rare occurrence, paladins do sometimes stray from the path of righteousness. Most of these wayward holy warriors seek out redemption and forgiveness for their misdeeds, regaining their powers through piety, charity, and powerful magic. Yet there are others, the dark and disturbed few, who turn actively to evil, courting the dark powers they once railed against in order to take vengeance on their former brothers. It's said that those who climb the farthest have the farthest to fall, and antipaladins are living proof of this fact, their pride and hatred blinding them to the glory of their forsaken patrons.</p>
			<p>Antipaladins become the antithesis of their former selves. They make pacts with fiends, take the lives of the innocent, and put nothing ahead of their personal power and wealth. Champions of evil, they often lead armies of evil creatures and work with other villains to bring ruin to the holy and tyranny to the weak. Not surprisingly, paladins stop at nothing to put an end to such nefarious antiheroes.</p>
			<p>The antipaladin is an alternate class. Making use of and altering numerous facets of the paladin core class, this villainous warrior can't truly be considered a new character class by its own right. By the changes made here, though, the details and tones of the paladin class are shifted in a completely opposite direction and captures an entirely different fantasy theme, without needlessly designing an entire new class. While a redesign of sorts, this alternate class can be used just as any of the other base classes found in the first part of this chapter.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: Antipaladins are villains at their most dangerous. They care nothing for the lives of others and actively seek to bring death and destruction to ordered society. They rarely travel with those that they do not subjugate, unless as part of a ruse to bring ruin from within.</p>
			<p>As an alternate paladin class, the antipaladin uses Table: Antipaladin to determine its base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, and spells per day. These details, along with the class's new special abilities, can be found on Table 2-13.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Chaotic evil.</p>
			<h>Ex-Antipaladins</h>
			<p>A antipaladin who ceases to be chaotic evil, who willfully commits an good act, or who violates the code of conduct loses all antipaladin spells and class features (including the fiendish boon, but not weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). He may not progress any further in levels as an antipaladin. He regains his abilities and advancement potential if he atones for his violations (see the <i>atonement </i>spell), as appropriate.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Antipaladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Evil (Ex) </b>: The power of an antipaladin's aura of evil (see the <i>detect evil </i>spell) is equal to his antipaladin level. A paladin who uses smite evil on an antipaladin deals 2 points of damage per paladin level on his first successful attack.</p>
			<p><b>Detect Good (Sp) </b>: At will, an antipaladin can use <i>detect good </i>, as the spell. An antipaladin can, as a move action, concentrate on a single item or individual within 60 feet and determine if it is good, learning the strength of its aura as if having studied it for 3 rounds. While focusing on one individual or object, the antipaladin does not detect good in any other object or individual within range.</p>
			<p><b>Smite Good (Su) </b>: Once per day, an antipaladin can call out to the dark powers to crush the forces of good. As a swift action, the antipaladin chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is good, the antipaladin adds his Charisma bonus (if any) on his attack rolls and adds his antipaladin level on all damage rolls made against the target of his smite. If the target of smite good is an outsider with the good subtype, a good-aligned dragon, or a good creature with levels of cleric or paladin, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per level the antipaladin possesses. Regardless of the target, smite good attacks automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess.</p>
			<p>In addition, while smite good is in effect, the antipaladin gains a deflection bonus equal to his Charisma modifier (if any) to his AC against attacks made by the target of the smite. If the antipaladin targets a creature that is not good, the smite is wasted with no effect.</p>
			<p>The smite good effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time the antipaladin rests and regains his uses of this ability. At 4th level, and at every three levels thereafter, the antipaladin may smite good one additional time per day, as indicated on Table 2-13, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Unholy Resilience (Su) </b>: At 2nd level, an antipaladin gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Touch of Corruption (Su) </b>: Beginning at 2nd level, an antipaladin surrounds his hand with a fiendish flame, causing terrible wounds to open on those he touches. Each day he can use this ability a number of times equal to 1/2 his antipaladin level + his Charisma modifier. As a touch attack, an antipaladin can cause 1d6 points of damage for every two antipaladin levels he possesses. Using this ability is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
			<p>Alternatively, an antipaladin can use this power to heal undead creatures, restoring 1d6 hit points for every two levels the antipaladin possesses. This ability is modified by any feat, spell, or effect that specifically works with the lay on hands paladin class feature. For example, the Extra Lay On Hands feat grants an antipaladin 2 additional uses of the touch of corruption class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Cowardice (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, an antipaladin radiates a palpably daunting aura that causes all enemies within 10 feet to take a -4 penalty on saving throws against fear effects. Creatures that are normally immune to fear lose that immunity while within 10 feet of an antipaladin with this ability. This ability functions only while the antipaladin remains conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Plague Bringer (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, the powers of darkness make an antipaladin a beacon of corruption and disease. An antipaladin does not take any damage or take any penalty from diseases. He can still contract diseases and spread them to others, but he is otherwise immune to their effects.</p>
			<p><b>Cruelty (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, an antipaladin can select one cruelty. Each cruelty adds an effect to the antipaladin's touch of corruption ability. Whenever the antipaladin uses touch of corruption to deal damage to one target, the target also receives the additional effect from one of the cruelties possessed by the antipaladin. This choice is made when the touch is used. The target receives a Fortitude save to avoid this cruelty. If the save is successful, the target takes the damage as normal, but not the effects of the cruelty. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the antipaladin's level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. At 3rd level, the antipaladin can select from the following initial cruelties.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Fatigued </i>: The target is fatigued.</li>
				<li><i>Shaken </i>: The target is shaken for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Sickened </i>: The target is sickened for 1 round per level of the antipaladin. At 6th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Dazed </i>: The target is dazed for 1 round.</li>
				<li><i>Diseased </i>: The target contracts a disease, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>contagion </i>, using his antipaladin level as his caster level.</li>
				<li><i>Staggered </i>: The target is staggered for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin. At 9th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Cursed </i>: The target is cursed, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>bestow curse </i>, using his antipaladin level as his caster level.</li>
				<li><i>Exhausted </i>: The target is exhausted. The antipaladin must have the fatigue cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Frightened </i>: The target is frightened for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the shaken cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Nauseated </i>: The target is nauseated for 1 round per three levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the sickened cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Poisoned </i>: The target is poisoned, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>poison </i>, using the antipaladin's level as the caster level. At 12th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Blinded </i>: The target is blinded for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Deafened </i>: The target is deafened for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Paralyzed </i>: The target is paralyzed for 1 round.</li>
				<li><i>Stunned </i>: The target is stunned for 1 round per four levels of the antipaladin. These abilities are not cumulative. For example, a 12th-level antipaladin's touch of corruption ability deals 6d6 points of damage and might also cause the target to become fatigued, dazed, poisoned, or diseased. Once a cruelty is chosen, it can't be changed.</li>
			</list>
			<p><b>Channel Negative Energy (Su) </b>: When an antipaladin reaches 4th level, he gains the supernatural ability to channel negative energy like a cleric. Using this ability consumes two uses of his touch of corruption ability. An antipaladin uses his level as his effective cleric level when channeling negative energy. This is a Charisma-based ability.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: Beginning at 4th level, an antipaladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells which are drawn from the antipaladin spell list presented in Chapter 5. An antipaladin must choose and prepare his spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, an antipaladin must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an antipaladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, an antipaladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is the same as that of a paladin and is given on Table 2-13. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-3 in the Core Rulebook). When Table 2-13 indicates that the antipaladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>An antipaladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. An antipaladin may prepare and cast any spell on the antipaladin spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, an antipaladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his antipaladin level -3.</p>
			<p><b>Touch of the Crypt (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a knight of the sepulcher gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects, death effects, and poison. He is harmed by positive energy effects and healed by negative energy effects as though he were undead, although negative energy effects that don&#146;t heal undead (such as enervation) affect him normally. The knight of the sepulcher has a 25% chance of ignoring critical hits and the bonus damage from sneak attacks as though he were wearing armor of light fortification. This ability replaces the fiendish boon ability.</p>
			<p><b>Fortitude of the Crypt (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a knight of the sepulcher gains immunity to poison. He also gains darkvision 60 feet if he does not already possess it. This ability replaces the aura of despair ability.</p>
			<p><b>Cloak of the Crypt (Ex): </b>At 10th level, the knight of the sepulcher gains immunity to energy drain and harmful negative energy effects. His chance of ignoring critical hits and sneak attacks increases to 50%, as though he were wearing armor of moderate fortification. This ability replaces the smite good use gained at 10th level.</p>
			<p><b>Will of the Crypt (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a knight of the sepulcher&#146;s bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects and death effects increases to +4. This ability replaces the aura of vengeance ability.</p>
			<p><b>Weapons of Sin (Su): </b>At 14th level, a knight of the sepulcher&#146;s weapons are treated as evil-aligned for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. This ability replaces aura of sin.</p>
			<p><b>Crypt Lord (Ex): </b>At 15th level, a knight of the sepulcher&#146;s chance of ignoring critical hits and sneak attacks increases to 75%, as though he were wearing armor of heavy fortification. He gains immunity to death effects, paralysis, sleep effects, and stunning. He no longer sleeps. The knight of the sepulcher also gains immunity to effects that cause fatigue, and effects that would cause him to become exhausted instead cause him to become fatigued. This ability replaces cruelty.</p>
			<p><b>Soul of the Crypt (Su): </b>At 17th level, a knight of the sepulcher gains DR 5/bludgeoning and good. This ability replaces aura of depravity.</p>
			<p><b>Undying Champion (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a knight of the sepulcher joins the ranks of the undead. His DR increases to 10/bludgeoning and good. His type changes to undead, and he acquires all undead traits. Although immune to disease, he can still carry and spread diseases with the antipaladin&#146;s plague bringer ability. The undying champion no longer has a Constitution score. He uses his Charisma score for calculating hit points, Fortitude saves, and any special abilities that rely on Constitution. This ability replaces unholy champion.</p>
			<p><b>Code of Conduct </b>: An antipaladin must be of chaotic evil alignment and loses all class features except proficiencies if he willingly and altruistically commits good acts. This does not mean that an antipaladin cannot take actions someone else might qualify as good, only that such actions must always be in service of his own dark ends. An antipaladin's code requires that he place his own interests and desires above all else, as well as impose tyranny, take advantage whenever possible, and punish the good and just, provided such actions don't interfere with his goals.</p>
			<p><b>Associates </b>: While he may adventure with evil or neutral allies, an antipaladin avoids working with good characters or with anyone who consistently attempts to do good deeds. Under exceptional circumstances, an antipaladin can ally with good associates, but only to defeat them from within and bring ruin to their ranks. An antipaladin does not need an atonement spell during such an unusual alliance as long as his nefarious goals are met in the end-evil cares only about results. An antipaladin may accept only henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are chaotic evil.</p>

				<name type="string">Fiendish Servant</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>The second type of bond allows an antipaladin to gain the service of a fiendish servant. This functions as <i>summon monster III </i>, except the duration is permanent and the antipaladin can only gain the service of a single creature and that creature must either have the chaotic and evil subtypes or it must be a fiendish animal. Once selected, the choice is set, but it may be changed whenever the antipaladin gains a level. Upon reaching 7th level, and every two levels thereafter, the level of the <i>summon monster </i>spell increases by one, to a maximum of <i>summon monster IX </i>at 17th level. Once per day, as a full-round action, an antipaladin may magically call his servant to his side. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the antipaladin's level. The servant immediately appears adjacent to the antipaladin. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels thereafter, for a total of four times per day at 17th level. At 11th level, the servant gains the advanced template (see the <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary </i>). At 15th level, an antipaladin's servant gains spell resistance equal to the antipaladin's level + 11. Should the antipaladin's fiendish servant die or be banished, the antipaladin may not summon another servant for 30 days or until he gains an antipaladin level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>

				<name type="string">Weapon Bond</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>The first type of bond allows the antipaladin to enhance his weapon as a standard action by calling upon the aid of a fiendish spirit for 1 minute per antipaladin level. When called, the spirit causes the weapon to shed unholy light as a torch. At 5th level, this spirit grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: <i>anarchic </i>, <i>flaming </i>, <i>flaming burst </i>, <i>keen </i>, <i>speed </i>, <i>unholy </i>, <i>vicious </i>, <i>vorpal </i>, and <i>wounding </i>. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table 15-9 in the <i>Core Rulebook </i>). These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The fiendish spirit imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than the antipaladin but resumes giving bonuses if returned to the antipaladin. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level. If a weapon bonded with a fiendish spirit is destroyed, the antipaladin loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until he gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, an antipaladin can select one cruelty. Each cruelty adds an effect to the antipaladin's touch of corruption ability. Whenever the antipaladin uses touch of corruption to deal damage to one target, the target also receives the additional effect from one of the cruelties possessed by the antipaladin. This choice is made when the touch is used. The target receives a Fortitude save to avoid this cruelty. If the save is successful, the target takes the damage as normal, but not the effects of the cruelty. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the antipaladin's level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. At 3rd level, the antipaladin can select from the following initial cruelties.</p>
					<list>
						<li><i>Fatigued </i>: The target is fatigued.</li>
						<li><i>Shaken </i>: The target is shaken for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
						<li><i>Sickened </i>: The target is sickened for 1 round per level of the antipaladin. At 6th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
						<li><i>Dazed </i>: The target is dazed for 1 round.</li>
						<li><i>Diseased </i>: The target contracts a disease, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>contagion </i>, using his antipaladin level as his caster level.</li>
						<li><i>Staggered </i>: The target is staggered for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin. At 9th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
						<li><i>Cursed </i>: The target is cursed, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>bestow curse </i>, using his antipaladin level as his caster level.</li>
						<li><i>Exhausted </i>: The target is exhausted. The antipaladin must have the fatigue cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
						<li><i>Frightened </i>: The target is frightened for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the shaken cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
						<li><i>Nauseated </i>: The target is nauseated for 1 round per three levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the sickened cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
						<li><i>Poisoned </i>: The target is poisoned, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>poison </i>, using the antipaladin's level as the caster level. At 12th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
						<li><i>Blinded </i>: The target is blinded for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
						<li><i>Deafened </i>: The target is deafened for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
						<li><i>Paralyzed </i>: The target is paralyzed for 1 round.</li>
						<li><i>Stunned </i>: The target is stunned for 1 round per four levels of the antipaladin. These abilities are not cumulative. For example, a 12th-level antipaladin's touch of corruption ability deals 6d6 points of damage and might also cause the target to become fatigued, dazed, poisoned, or diseased. Once a cruelty is chosen, it can't be changed.</li>

					<p>Beginning at 4th level, an antipaladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells which are drawn from the antipaladin spell list presented in Chapter 5. An antipaladin must choose and prepare his spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, an antipaladin must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an antipaladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, an antipaladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is the same as that of a paladin and is given on Table 2-13. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-3 in the Core Rulebook). When Table 2-13 indicates that the antipaladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level. An antipaladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. An antipaladin may prepare and cast any spell on the antipaladin spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation. Through 3rd level, an antipaladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his antipaladin level -3.</p>

					<p>Beginning at 2nd level, an antipaladin surrounds his hand with a fiendish flame, causing terrible wounds to open on those he touches. Each day he can use this ability a number of times equal to 1/2 his antipaladin level + his Charisma modifier. As a touch attack, an antipaladin can cause 1d6 points of damage for every two antipaladin levels he possesses. Using this ability is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Alternatively, an antipaladin can use this power to heal undead creatures, restoring 1d6 hit points for every two levels the antipaladin possesses. This ability is modified by any feat, spell, or effect that specifically works with the lay on hands paladin class feature. For example, the Extra Lay On Hands feat grants an antipaladin 2 additional uses of the touch of corruption class feature.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Covered from head to toe in blackened armor decorated with grotesque shapes and bristling with spikes, iron tyrants make an unmistakable impression on the battlefield. These antipaladins&#146; armor is an outward symbol of their inner power, and they are rarely seen without it. Iron tyrants seek the strength to rule over domains as unfettered despots, and depend on their armor as protection against those they have not yet cowed.</i></p>
			<p><i>Most iron tyrants are orcs or half-orcs who worship the orc deities Lanishra (god of slavery, subjugation, and tyranny) or Varg (god of iron, siege weapons, and warfare). Though rarer, some iron tyrants belong to other races and worship Urazra (giant god of battle, brutality, and strength) or demon lords such as Aldinach (She of the Six Venoms), Angazhan (the Ravenous King), or Izyagna (She of the Sevenfold Swarm).</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although it is a rare occurrence, paladins do sometimes stray from the path of righteousness. Most of these wayward holy warriors seek out redemption and forgiveness for their misdeeds, regaining their powers through piety, charity, and powerful magic. Yet there are others, the dark and disturbed few, who turn actively to evil, courting the dark powers they once railed against in order to take vengeance on their former brothers. It's said that those who climb the farthest have the farthest to fall, and antipaladins are living proof of this fact, their pride and hatred blinding them to the glory of their forsaken patrons.</p>
			<p>Antipaladins become the antithesis of their former selves. They make pacts with fiends, take the lives of the innocent, and put nothing ahead of their personal power and wealth. Champions of evil, they often lead armies of evil creatures and work with other villains to bring ruin to the holy and tyranny to the weak. Not surprisingly, paladins stop at nothing to put an end to such nefarious antiheroes.</p>
			<p>The antipaladin is an alternate class. Making use of and altering numerous facets of the paladin core class, this villainous warrior can't truly be considered a new character class by its own right. By the changes made here, though, the details and tones of the paladin class are shifted in a completely opposite direction and captures an entirely different fantasy theme, without needlessly designing an entire new class. While a redesign of sorts, this alternate class can be used just as any of the other base classes found in the first part of this chapter.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: Antipaladins are villains at their most dangerous. They care nothing for the lives of others and actively seek to bring death and destruction to ordered society. They rarely travel with those that they do not subjugate, unless as part of a ruse to bring ruin from within.</p>
			<p>As an alternate paladin class, the antipaladin uses Table: Antipaladin to determine its base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, and spells per day. These details, along with the class's new special abilities, can be found on Table 2-13.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Chaotic evil.</p>
			<h>Ex-Antipaladins</h>
			<p>A antipaladin who ceases to be chaotic evil, who willfully commits an good act, or who violates the code of conduct loses all antipaladin spells and class features (including the fiendish boon, but not weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). He may not progress any further in levels as an antipaladin. He regains his abilities and advancement potential if he atones for his violations (see the <i>atonement </i>spell), as appropriate.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Antipaladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Evil (Ex) </b>: The power of an antipaladin's aura of evil (see the <i>detect evil </i>spell) is equal to his antipaladin level. A paladin who uses smite evil on an antipaladin deals 2 points of damage per paladin level on his first successful attack.</p>
			<p><b>Detect Good (Sp) </b>: At will, an antipaladin can use <i>detect good </i>, as the spell. An antipaladin can, as a move action, concentrate on a single item or individual within 60 feet and determine if it is good, learning the strength of its aura as if having studied it for 3 rounds. While focusing on one individual or object, the antipaladin does not detect good in any other object or individual within range.</p>
			<p><b>Smite Good (Su) </b>: Once per day, an antipaladin can call out to the dark powers to crush the forces of good. As a swift action, the antipaladin chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is good, the antipaladin adds his Charisma bonus (if any) on his attack rolls and adds his antipaladin level on all damage rolls made against the target of his smite. If the target of smite good is an outsider with the good subtype, a good-aligned dragon, or a good creature with levels of cleric or paladin, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per level the antipaladin possesses. Regardless of the target, smite good attacks automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess.</p>
			<p>In addition, while smite good is in effect, the antipaladin gains a deflection bonus equal to his Charisma modifier (if any) to his AC against attacks made by the target of the smite. If the antipaladin targets a creature that is not good, the smite is wasted with no effect.</p>
			<p>The smite good effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time the antipaladin rests and regains his uses of this ability. At 4th level, and at every three levels thereafter, the antipaladin may smite good one additional time per day, as indicated on Table 2-13, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Unholy Resilience (Su) </b>: At 2nd level, an antipaladin gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Iron Fist (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, an iron tyrant gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. In addition, whenever the iron tyrant makes a successful attack with a gauntlet, spiked gauntlet, or armor spikes, the weapon damage is based on his level and not the weapon type, as per the warpriest&#146;s sacred weapon ability.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces touch of corruption.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Cowardice (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, an antipaladin radiates a palpably daunting aura that causes all enemies within 10 feet to take a -4 penalty on saving throws against fear effects. Creatures that are normally immune to fear lose that immunity while within 10 feet of an antipaladin with this ability. This ability functions only while the antipaladin remains conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Plague Bringer (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, the powers of darkness make an antipaladin a beacon of corruption and disease. An antipaladin does not take any damage or take any penalty from diseases. He can still contract diseases and spread them to others, but he is otherwise immune to their effects.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feats: </b>At 3rd level and every 3 antipaladin levels thereafter, an iron tyrant gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. This feat must be a combat feat that relates to the iron tyrant&#146;s armor or shield, such as Shield Focus, or one of the armor mastery feats.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces cruelty.</p>
			<p><b>Unstoppable (Ex): </b>At 4th level, when wearing heavy armor, an iron tyrant is not slowed by terrain that halves movement (such as dense rubble, light undergrowth, and shallow bogs). Terrain that has been magically manipulated to impede motion or terrain that reduces movement by more than half still affects him.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces channel negative energy.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: Beginning at 4th level, an antipaladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells which are drawn from the antipaladin spell list presented in Chapter 5. An antipaladin must choose and prepare his spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, an antipaladin must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an antipaladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, an antipaladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is the same as that of a paladin and is given on Table 2-13. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-3 in the Core Rulebook). When Table 2-13 indicates that the antipaladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>An antipaladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. An antipaladin may prepare and cast any spell on the antipaladin spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, an antipaladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his antipaladin level -3.</p>
			<p><b>Fiendish Bond (Su): </b>At 5th level, instead of forming a fiendish bond with his weapon or a servant, an iron tyrant can form a bond with his armor. As a standard action, an iron tyrant can enhance his armor by calling upon a fiendish spirit&#146;s aid. This bond lasts for 1 minute per antipaladin level. When called, the spirit causes the armor to shed unholy light like a torch. At 5th level, the spirit grants the armor a +1 enhancement bonus. For every 3 antipaladin levels beyond 5th, the armor gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses stack with existing armor enhancement bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following armor special abilities: dastard, ghost touch, fortification (heavy, light, or medium), invulnerability, spell resistance (13, 15, 17, or 19). Adding these special abilities consumes an amount of bonus equal to the special ability&#146;s base price modifier. In addition, the iron tyrant can grant his armor the unrighteous special ability at the cost of a +4 bonus. These special abilities are added to any special abilities the armor already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the armor is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other special abilities can be added. The bonus and special abilities granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The fiendish spirit imparts no bonuses if the armor is worn by anyone other than the iron tyrant, but it resumes giving bonuses if the iron tyrant dons the armor again. An iron tyrant can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every 4 levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level.</p>
			<p>If a suit of bonded armor with a fiendish spirit is destroyed, the iron tyrant loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until he gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the iron tyrant takes a &#150;1 penalty on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces fiendish boon.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Despair (Su) </b>: At 8th level, enemies within 10 feet of an antipaladin take a -2 penalty on all saving throws. This penalty does not stack with the penalty from aura of cowardice.</p>
			<p>This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Vengeance (Su) </b>: At 11th level, an antipaladin can expend two uses of his smite good ability to grant the ability to smite good to all allies within 10 feet, using his bonuses. Allies must use this smite good ability by the start of the antipaladin's next turn and the bonuses last for 1 minute. Using this ability is a free action. Good creatures gain no benefit from this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Sin (Su) </b>: At 14th level, an antipaladin's weapons are treated as evil-aligned for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. Any attack made against an enemy within 10 feet of him is treated as evil-aligned for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Depravity (Su) </b>: At 17th level, an antipaladin gains DR 5/good. Each enemy within 10 feet takes a -4 penalty on saving throws against compulsion effects. This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Unholy Champion (Su) </b>: At 20th level, an antipaladin becomes a conduit for the might of the dark powers. His DR increases to 10/good. Whenever he uses smite good and successfully strikes an good outsider, the outsider is also subject to a <i>banishment </i>, using his antipaladin level as the caster level (his weapon and unholy symbol automatically count as objects that the subject hates). After the <i>banishment </i>effect and the damage from the attack is resolved, the smite immediately ends. In addition, whenever he channels negative energy or uses touch of corruption to damage a creature, he deals the maximum possible amount.</p>
			<p><b>Code of Conduct </b>: An antipaladin must be of chaotic evil alignment and loses all class features except proficiencies if he willingly and altruistically commits good acts. This does not mean that an antipaladin cannot take actions someone else might qualify as good, only that such actions must always be in service of his own dark ends. An antipaladin's code requires that he place his own interests and desires above all else, as well as impose tyranny, take advantage whenever possible, and punish the good and just, provided such actions don't interfere with his goals.</p>
			<p><b>Associates </b>: While he may adventure with evil or neutral allies, an antipaladin avoids working with good characters or with anyone who consistently attempts to do good deeds. Under exceptional circumstances, an antipaladin can ally with good associates, but only to defeat them from within and bring ruin to their ranks. An antipaladin does not need an atonement spell during such an unusual alliance as long as his nefarious goals are met in the end-evil cares only about results. An antipaladin may accept only henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are chaotic evil.</p>

					<p>An insinuator must always work toward his own self-interest, enrichment, or glory, and must also abide by the moral strictures of whatever outsider they have chosen to invoke that day (see invocation below). If the insinuator breaks an invoked outsider&#146;s code, he cannot invoke outsiders of that same alignment until he seeks atonement, although outsiders of other alignments may still heed his call.</p>

				<name type="string">Fiendish Servant</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>The second type of bond allows an antipaladin to gain the service of a fiendish servant. This functions as <i>summon monster III </i>, except the duration is permanent and the antipaladin can only gain the service of a single creature and that creature must either have the chaotic and evil subtypes or it must be a fiendish animal. Once selected, the choice is set, but it may be changed whenever the antipaladin gains a level. Upon reaching 7th level, and every two levels thereafter, the level of the <i>summon monster </i>spell increases by one, to a maximum of <i>summon monster IX </i>at 17th level. Once per day, as a full-round action, an antipaladin may magically call his servant to his side. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the antipaladin's level. The servant immediately appears adjacent to the antipaladin. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels thereafter, for a total of four times per day at 17th level. At 11th level, the servant gains the advanced template (see the <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary </i>). At 15th level, an antipaladin's servant gains spell resistance equal to the antipaladin's level + 11. Should the antipaladin's fiendish servant die or be banished, the antipaladin may not summon another servant for 30 days or until he gains an antipaladin level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>The first type of bond allows the antipaladin to enhance his weapon as a standard action by calling upon the aid of a fiendish spirit for 1 minute per antipaladin level. When called, the spirit causes the weapon to shed unholy light as a torch. At 5th level, this spirit grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: <i>anarchic </i>, <i>flaming </i>, <i>flaming burst </i>, <i>keen </i>, <i>speed </i>, <i>unholy </i>, <i>vicious </i>, <i>vorpal </i>, and <i>wounding </i>. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table 15-9 in the <i>Core Rulebook </i>). These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The fiendish spirit imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than the antipaladin but resumes giving bonuses if returned to the antipaladin. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level. If a weapon bonded with a fiendish spirit is destroyed, the antipaladin loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until he gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>

An insinuator can freely invoke an outsider of his own alignment. He can instead invoke an outsider within one step of his own alignment by succeeding at a Diplomacy or Knowledge (religion) skill check (DC = 15 + the insinuator&#146;s antipaladin level). While invoking the power of an outsider, the insinuator radiates an alignment aura that matches that of the outsider&#146;s, and becomes vulnerable to alignment-based effects that target that outsider&#146;s alignment (such as smite evil or chaos hammer). None of an insinuator&#146;s supernatural or spell-like class abilities function unless he has invoked the power of an outsider, and the alignment of the being invoked may affect how some abilities function.</p>

					<p>Beginning at 4th level, an antipaladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells which are drawn from the antipaladin spell list presented in Chapter 5. An antipaladin must choose and prepare his spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, an antipaladin must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an antipaladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, an antipaladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is the same as that of a paladin and is given on Table 2-13. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-3 in the Core Rulebook). When Table 2-13 indicates that the antipaladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level. An antipaladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. An antipaladin may prepare and cast any spell on the antipaladin spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation. Through 3rd level, an antipaladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his antipaladin level -3.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Between the selfless nobility of paladins and the chaotic menace of antipaladins, there exists a path of dedicated self-interest. Shunning the ties that bind them to a single deity, insinuators embrace whatever forces help them achieve their own agenda and glory, borrowing power to emulate divine warriors.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although it is a rare occurrence, paladins do sometimes stray from the path of righteousness. Most of these wayward holy warriors seek out redemption and forgiveness for their misdeeds, regaining their powers through piety, charity, and powerful magic. Yet there are others, the dark and disturbed few, who turn actively to evil, courting the dark powers they once railed against in order to take vengeance on their former brothers. It's said that those who climb the farthest have the farthest to fall, and antipaladins are living proof of this fact, their pride and hatred blinding them to the glory of their forsaken patrons.</p>
			<p>Antipaladins become the antithesis of their former selves. They make pacts with fiends, take the lives of the innocent, and put nothing ahead of their personal power and wealth. Champions of evil, they often lead armies of evil creatures and work with other villains to bring ruin to the holy and tyranny to the weak. Not surprisingly, paladins stop at nothing to put an end to such nefarious antiheroes.</p>
			<p>The antipaladin is an alternate class. Making use of and altering numerous facets of the paladin core class, this villainous warrior can't truly be considered a new character class by its own right. By the changes made here, though, the details and tones of the paladin class are shifted in a completely opposite direction and captures an entirely different fantasy theme, without needlessly designing an entire new class. While a redesign of sorts, this alternate class can be used just as any of the other base classes found in the first part of this chapter.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: Antipaladins are villains at their most dangerous. They care nothing for the lives of others and actively seek to bring death and destruction to ordered society. They rarely travel with those that they do not subjugate, unless as part of a ruse to bring ruin from within.</p>
			<p>As an alternate paladin class, the antipaladin uses Table: Antipaladin to determine its base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, and spells per day. These details, along with the class's new special abilities, can be found on Table 2-13.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any evil.</p>
			<h>Ex-Insinuators</h>
			<p>An insinuator who willfully commits self less acts or engages in violence that doesn&#146;t further his own ends loses all class features (including his outsider servant, but not bonus feats or weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). He can&#146;t progress any further in levels as an insinuator. He regains his abilities and advancement potential if he atones for his faltering ambition (see the atonement spell). If he violates the code of conduct of his invoked outsider patron, he must similarly seek atonement from outsiders of that alignment again.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Antipaladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Invocation (Ex): </b>At the start of each day, an insinuator can meditate for 10 minutes to contact and barter with an outsider to empower him for a day. An insinuator can freely invoke an outsider of his own alignment. He can instead invoke an outsider within one step of his own alignment by succeeding at a Diplomacy or Knowledge (religion) skill check (DC = 15 + the insinuator&#146;s antipaladin level). While invoking the power of an outsider, the insinuator radiates an alignment aura that matches that of the outsider&#146;s, and becomes vulnerable to alignment-based effects that target that outsider&#146;s alignment (such as smite evil or chaos hammer). None of an insinuator&#146;s supernatural or spell-like class abilities function unless he has invoked the power of an outsider, and the alignment of the being invoked may affect how some abilities function.</p>
			<p><b>Detect Balance (Sp): </b>At will, an insinuator can detect strong moral leanings. This functions as detect evil or detect good, but does not actually reveal the target&#146;s alignment, only whether the target is neutral (rather than good or evil) and the relative strength of that aura. This ability alters detect good.</p>
			<p><b>Smite Impudence (Su): </b>Once per day, an insinuator can beseech the forces empowering him to punish their shared enemies. As a swift action, the insinuator chooses one target within sight to smite. An insinuator cannot use smite against a target that shares an alignment with the outsider he has invoked for the day. The insinuator adds his Charisma bonus on his attack rolls and half his insinuator level on all damage rolls made against the target of his smite. If the target is an outsider, dragon, or divine spellcaster with an alignment opposed to that of the outsider he has invoked for the day, the bonus damage on the first successful attack increases to 1 point of damage per antipaladin level the insinuator has. Regardless of the target, the smite attack automatically bypasses any damage reduction the creature might possess. In addition, each time the insinuator declares a smite, he gains a number of temporary hit points equal to his antipaladin level.</p>
			<p>The smite effect remains until the target is defeated or the next time the insinuator rests and regains his uses of this ability. At 4th level and at every 3 levels thereafter, the insinuator can use smite one additional time per day, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level. This ability replaces smite good.</p>
			<p><b>Unholy Resilience (Su) </b>: At 2nd level, an antipaladin gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Selfish Healing (Su): </b>Beginning at 2nd level, an insinuator can heal his wounds by touch. This is treated exactly like the paladin&#146;s lay on hands class feature, except it can be used only to heal the insinuator and cannot be used on other creatures. This ability replaces touch of corruption.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Ego (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, an insinuator radiates an aura that bolsters allies and deters enemies. Each ally within 10 feet gains a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. Enemies within 10 feet take a &#150;2 penalty on saving throws against fear effects. This ability functions only while the insinuator is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead. This ability replaces aura of cowardice.</p>
			<p><b>Stubborn Health (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, an insinuator takes only half damage from diseases and poisons, and none of his ability scores can be reduced below 1 by these effects. This ability replaces plague bringer.</p>
			<p><b>Greeds (Su) </b>: Beginning at 3rd level, an insinuator can heal himself of certain conditions. This functions as the mercy paladin class ability, but these mercies can only be applied to the insinuator himself. This ability replaces cruelty.</p>
			<p><b>Channel Energy (Su) </b>: At 4th level, an insinuator can channel negative energy, treating his antipaladin level as his effective cleric level. If he invokes a neutral outsider for the day, he may instead chose during the invocation to channel positive energy, but treats his effective cleric level as half his antipaladin level. Using this ability consumes two uses of his selfish healing ability. This is a Charisma-based ability. This ability alters channel negative energy.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feats: </b>At 4th level, an insinuator gains one bonus feat, which must be selected from the list of combat feats or Skill Focus. At 7th level and every 3 antipaladin levels thereafter, the insinuator gains one additional combat or Skill Focus feat. This ability replaces antipaladin spells.</p>
			<p><b>Ambitious Bond (Sp) </b>: At 5th level, an insinuator gains a divine bond with either a bonded weapon or an outsider servant. This functions as the antipaladin&#146;s fiendish boon with the following modifications.</p>
			<p><b>Bonded Weapon: </b>This functions as the antipaladin ability, except the first special ability added to a weapon must correspond to the alignment of the outsider the insinuator has invoked for that day: anarchic (chaos), axiomatic (law), or unholy (evil). Additional special abilities may be applied if any equivalent bonus remains.</p>
			<p><b>Outsider Servant: </b>This functions as the antipaladin ability, except the insinuator gains a new outsider servant each day, whose alignment must match the alignment of the outsider invoked for the day. The outsider servant functions as much as an agent for the patron invoked by the insinuator as an ally of the insinuator himself, and may turn against him if he violates his patron&#146;s alignment or interests.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Ambition (Su): </b>At 8th level, enemies within 10 feet of an insinuator take a &#150;1 penalty on all saving throws. All allies within 10 feet gain a +1 bonus on all saving throws. This penalty does not stack with the penalty from aura of the crusader. This ability functions only while the insinuator is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead. This ability replaces aura of despair.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Glory (Su): </b>At 11th level, an insinuator can expend two uses of his smite impudence ability to grant the ability to smite impudence to all allies within 10 feet, using his bonuses. Allies must use this smite impudence ability before the start of the insinuator&#146;s next turn, and the bonuses last for 1 minute. Using this ability is a free action. This ability replaces aura of vengeance.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Belief (Su): </b>At 14th level, an insinuator&#146;s weapons are treated as chaos-aligned while he invokes a chaotic outsider, law-aligned when he invokes a lawful outsider, or evil-aligned while he invokes an evil outsider. If he invokes an outsider with more than one alignment aura, the insinuator must choose during the initial invocation which alignment his weapon radiates. This ability replaces aura of sin.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Indomitability (Su): </b>At 17th level, an insinuator gains DR 10 that is bypassed by the alignment opposite of the outsider he has invoked for the day, or DR 5/&#151; while invoking a neutral outsider. This ability replaces aura of depravity.</p>
			<p><b>Personal Champion (Su): </b>At 20th level, an insinuator becomes a living embodiment of his selfish desires. His damage resistance from aura of indomitability increases to 15 (or 10 while invoking a neutral outsider). Whenever he uses smite impudence, he adds twice his full Charisma bonus to the attack roll and doubles his effective bonus damage gained from the smite. In addition, he can invoke a new outsider patron by meditating for 10 minutes. This ability replaces unholy champion.</p>
			<p><b>Code of Conduct </b>: An insinuator must always work toward his own self-interest, enrichment, or glory, and must also abide by the moral strictures of whatever outsider they have chosen to invoke that day (see invocation below). If the insinuator breaks an invoked outsider&#146;s code, he cannot invoke outsiders of that same alignment until he seeks atonement, although outsiders of other alignments may still heed his call.</p>
			<p><b>Associates </b>: While he may adventure with evil or neutral allies, an antipaladin avoids working with good characters or with anyone who consistently attempts to do good deeds. Under exceptional circumstances, an antipaladin can ally with good associates, but only to defeat them from within and bring ruin to their ranks. An antipaladin does not need an atonement spell during such an unusual alliance as long as his nefarious goals are met in the end-evil cares only about results. An antipaladin may accept only henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are chaotic evil.</p>

					<p>An antipaladin must be of chaotic evil alignment and loses all class features except proficiencies if he willingly and altruistically commits good acts. This does not mean that an antipaladin cannot take actions someone else might qualify as good, only that such actions must always be in service of his own dark ends. An antipaladin's code requires that he place his own interests and desires above all else, as well as impose tyranny, take advantage whenever possible, and punish the good and just, provided such actions don't interfere with his goals.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>The second type of bond allows an antipaladin to gain the service of a fiendish servant. This functions as <i>summon monster III </i>, except the duration is permanent and the antipaladin can only gain the service of a single creature and that creature must either have the chaotic and evil subtypes or it must be a fiendish animal. Once selected, the choice is set, but it may be changed whenever the antipaladin gains a level. Upon reaching 7th level, and every two levels thereafter, the level of the <i>summon monster </i>spell increases by one, to a maximum of <i>summon monster IX </i>at 17th level. Once per day, as a full-round action, an antipaladin may magically call his servant to his side. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the antipaladin's level. The servant immediately appears adjacent to the antipaladin. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels thereafter, for a total of four times per day at 17th level. At 11th level, the servant gains the advanced template (see the <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary </i>). At 15th level, an antipaladin's servant gains spell resistance equal to the antipaladin's level + 11. Should the antipaladin's fiendish servant die or be banished, the antipaladin may not summon another servant for 30 days or until he gains an antipaladin level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>

				<name type="string">Weapon Bond</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>The first type of bond allows the antipaladin to enhance his weapon as a standard action by calling upon the aid of a fiendish spirit for 1 minute per antipaladin level. When called, the spirit causes the weapon to shed unholy light as a torch. At 5th level, this spirit grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: <i>anarchic </i>, <i>flaming </i>, <i>flaming burst </i>, <i>keen </i>, <i>speed </i>, <i>unholy </i>, <i>vicious </i>, <i>vorpal </i>, and <i>wounding </i>. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table 15-9 in the <i>Core Rulebook </i>). These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The fiendish spirit imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than the antipaladin but resumes giving bonuses if returned to the antipaladin. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level. If a weapon bonded with a fiendish spirit is destroyed, the antipaladin loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until he gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>

					<p>At will, an antipaladin can use <i>detect good </i>, as the spell. An antipaladin can, as a move action, concentrate on a single item or individual within 60 feet and determine if it is good, learning the strength of its aura as if having studied it for 3 rounds. While focusing on one individual or object, the antipaladin does not detect good in any other object or individual within range.</p>

					<p>Once per day, an antipaladin can call out to the dark powers to crush the forces of good. As a swift action, the antipaladin chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is good, the antipaladin adds his Charisma bonus (if any) on his attack rolls and adds his antipaladin level on all damage rolls made against the target of his smite. If the target of smite good is an outsider with the good subtype, a good-aligned dragon, or a good creature with levels of cleric or paladin, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per level the antipaladin possesses. Regardless of the target, smite good attacks automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess. In addition, while smite good is in effect, the antipaladin gains a deflection bonus equal to his Charisma modifier (if any) to his AC against attacks made by the target of the smite.

The smite good effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time the antipaladin rests and regains his uses of this ability.

					<p>Beginning at 4th level, an antipaladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells which are drawn from the antipaladin spell list presented in Chapter 5. An antipaladin must choose and prepare his spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, an antipaladin must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an antipaladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, an antipaladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is the same as that of a paladin and is given on Table 2-13. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-3 in the Core Rulebook). When Table 2-13 indicates that the antipaladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level. An antipaladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. An antipaladin may prepare and cast any spell on the antipaladin spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation. Through 3rd level, an antipaladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his antipaladin level -3.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The fearmonger wants to do more than cause pain, misery, and confusion. He wishes to spread fear among his foes and infect entire populations with it. The fearmonger archetype is available only to the antipaladin alternate class.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although it is a rare occurrence, paladins do sometimes stray from the path of righteousness. Most of these wayward holy warriors seek out redemption and forgiveness for their misdeeds, regaining their powers through piety, charity, and powerful magic. Yet there are others, the dark and disturbed few, who turn actively to evil, courting the dark powers they once railed against in order to take vengeance on their former brothers. It's said that those who climb the farthest have the farthest to fall, and antipaladins are living proof of this fact, their pride and hatred blinding them to the glory of their forsaken patrons.</p>
			<p>Antipaladins become the antithesis of their former selves. They make pacts with fiends, take the lives of the innocent, and put nothing ahead of their personal power and wealth. Champions of evil, they often lead armies of evil creatures and work with other villains to bring ruin to the holy and tyranny to the weak. Not surprisingly, paladins stop at nothing to put an end to such nefarious antiheroes.</p>
			<p>The antipaladin is an alternate class. Making use of and altering numerous facets of the paladin core class, this villainous warrior can't truly be considered a new character class by its own right. By the changes made here, though, the details and tones of the paladin class are shifted in a completely opposite direction and captures an entirely different fantasy theme, without needlessly designing an entire new class. While a redesign of sorts, this alternate class can be used just as any of the other base classes found in the first part of this chapter.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: Antipaladins are villains at their most dangerous. They care nothing for the lives of others and actively seek to bring death and destruction to ordered society. They rarely travel with those that they do not subjugate, unless as part of a ruse to bring ruin from within.</p>
			<p>As an alternate paladin class, the antipaladin uses Table: Antipaladin to determine its base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, and spells per day. These details, along with the class's new special abilities, can be found on Table 2-13.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Chaotic evil.</p>
			<h>Ex-Antipaladins</h>
			<p>A antipaladin who ceases to be chaotic evil, who willfully commits an good act, or who violates the code of conduct loses all antipaladin spells and class features (including the fiendish boon, but not weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). He may not progress any further in levels as an antipaladin. He regains his abilities and advancement potential if he atones for his violations (see the <i>atonement </i>spell), as appropriate.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Antipaladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Evil (Ex) </b>: The power of an antipaladin's aura of evil (see the <i>detect evil </i>spell) is equal to his antipaladin level. A paladin who uses smite evil on an antipaladin deals 2 points of damage per paladin level on his first successful attack.</p>
			<p><b>Detect Good (Sp) </b>: At will, an antipaladin can use <i>detect good </i>, as the spell. An antipaladin can, as a move action, concentrate on a single item or individual within 60 feet and determine if it is good, learning the strength of its aura as if having studied it for 3 rounds. While focusing on one individual or object, the antipaladin does not detect good in any other object or individual within range.</p>
			<p><b>Smite Good (Su) </b>: Once per day, an antipaladin can call out to the dark powers to crush the forces of good. As a swift action, the antipaladin chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is good, the antipaladin adds his Charisma bonus (if any) on his attack rolls and adds his antipaladin level on all damage rolls made against the target of his smite. If the target of smite good is an outsider with the good subtype, a good-aligned dragon, or a good creature with levels of cleric or paladin, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per level the antipaladin possesses. Regardless of the target, smite good attacks automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess.</p>
			<p>In addition, while smite good is in effect, the antipaladin gains a deflection bonus equal to his Charisma modifier (if any) to his AC against attacks made by the target of the smite. If the antipaladin targets a creature that is not good, the smite is wasted with no effect.</p>
			<p>The smite good effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time the antipaladin rests and regains his uses of this ability. At 4th level, and at every three levels thereafter, the antipaladin may smite good one additional time per day, as indicated on Table 2-13, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Unholy Resilience (Su) </b>: At 2nd level, an antipaladin gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Feed on Fear (Su): </b>At 2nd level, the first time in a round a creature fails a saving throw against a fear effect created by a fearmonger&#146;s spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability (including any ability that causes a creature to be shaken, frightened, or panicked), the fearmonger is healed of 1 point of damage per 2 antipaladin levels. If the fearmonger is at full hit points when this ability is activated, he instead gains an equal number of temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute. Temporary hit points gained through multiple successful uses of this ability do not stack; the duration increases instead.</p>
			<p>The antipaladin can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 his antipaladin level plus his Charisma bonus. This ability replaces touch of corruption.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Cowardice (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, an antipaladin radiates a palpably daunting aura that causes all enemies within 10 feet to take a -4 penalty on saving throws against fear effects. Creatures that are normally immune to fear lose that immunity while within 10 feet of an antipaladin with this ability. This ability functions only while the antipaladin remains conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Plague Bringer (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, the powers of darkness make an antipaladin a beacon of corruption and disease. An antipaladin does not take any damage or take any penalty from diseases. He can still contract diseases and spread them to others, but he is otherwise immune to their effects.</p>
			<p><b>Cruelty (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, an antipaladin can select one cruelty. Each cruelty adds an effect to the antipaladin's touch of corruption ability. Whenever the antipaladin uses touch of corruption to deal damage to one target, the target also receives the additional effect from one of the cruelties possessed by the antipaladin. This choice is made when the touch is used. The target receives a Fortitude save to avoid this cruelty. If the save is successful, the target takes the damage as normal, but not the effects of the cruelty. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the antipaladin's level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. At 3rd level, the antipaladin can select from the following initial cruelties.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Fatigued </i>: The target is fatigued.</li>
				<li><i>Shaken </i>: The target is shaken for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Sickened </i>: The target is sickened for 1 round per level of the antipaladin. At 6th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Dazed </i>: The target is dazed for 1 round.</li>
				<li><i>Diseased </i>: The target contracts a disease, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>contagion </i>, using his antipaladin level as his caster level.</li>
				<li><i>Staggered </i>: The target is staggered for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin. At 9th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Cursed </i>: The target is cursed, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>bestow curse </i>, using his antipaladin level as his caster level.</li>
				<li><i>Exhausted </i>: The target is exhausted. The antipaladin must have the fatigue cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Frightened </i>: The target is frightened for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the shaken cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Nauseated </i>: The target is nauseated for 1 round per three levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the sickened cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Poisoned </i>: The target is poisoned, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>poison </i>, using the antipaladin's level as the caster level. At 12th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Blinded </i>: The target is blinded for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Deafened </i>: The target is deafened for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Paralyzed </i>: The target is paralyzed for 1 round.</li>
				<li><i>Stunned </i>: The target is stunned for 1 round per four levels of the antipaladin. These abilities are not cumulative. For example, a 12th-level antipaladin's touch of corruption ability deals 6d6 points of damage and might also cause the target to become fatigued, dazed, poisoned, or diseased. Once a cruelty is chosen, it can't be changed.</li>
			</list>
			<p><b>Frightening Cruelty (Su): </b>The fearmonger must select shaken as his 3rd-level cruelty, dazed as his 6th-level cruelty, and frightened as his 9th-level cruelty. At 12th level, the fearmonger gains the panicked cruelty.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Panicked: </i>The target is panicked for 1 round per 4 class levels the antipaladin possesses. The antipaladin must have the shaken and frightened cruelties before selecting this cruelty.</li>
			</list>
			<p>This class feature alters cruelty.</p>
			<p><b>Channel Negative Energy (Su) </b>: When an antipaladin reaches 4th level, he gains the supernatural ability to channel negative energy like a cleric. Using this ability consumes two uses of his touch of corruption ability. An antipaladin uses his level as his effective cleric level when channeling negative energy. This is a Charisma-based ability.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: Beginning at 4th level, an antipaladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells which are drawn from the antipaladin spell list presented in Chapter 5. An antipaladin must choose and prepare his spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, an antipaladin must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an antipaladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, an antipaladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is the same as that of a paladin and is given on Table 2-13. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-3 in the Core Rulebook). When Table 2-13 indicates that the antipaladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>An antipaladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. An antipaladin may prepare and cast any spell on the antipaladin spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, an antipaladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his antipaladin level -3.</p>
			<p><b>Fiendish Boon (Sp) </b>: Upon reaching 5th level, an antipaladin receives a boon from his dark patrons. This boon can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Bond </b>: The first type of bond allows the antipaladin to enhance his weapon as a standard action by calling upon the aid of a fiendish spirit for 1 minute per antipaladin level. When called, the spirit causes the weapon to shed unholy light as a torch. At 5th level, this spirit grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: <i>anarchic </i>, <i>flaming </i>, <i>flaming burst </i>, <i>keen </i>, <i>speed </i>, <i>unholy </i>, <i>vicious </i>, <i>vorpal </i>, and <i>wounding </i>. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table 15-9 in the <i>Core Rulebook </i>). These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The fiendish spirit imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than the antipaladin but resumes giving bonuses if returned to the antipaladin. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level.</p>
			<p>If a weapon bonded with a fiendish spirit is destroyed, the antipaladin loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until he gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>
			<p><b>Fiendish Servant </b>: The second type of bond allows an antipaladin to gain the service of a fiendish servant. This functions as <i>summon monster III </i>, except the duration is permanent and the antipaladin can only gain the service of a single creature and that creature must either have the chaotic and evil subtypes or it must be a fiendish animal. Once selected, the choice is set, but it may be changed whenever the antipaladin gains a level. Upon reaching 7th level, and every two levels thereafter, the level of the <i>summon monster </i>spell increases by one, to a maximum of <i>summon monster IX </i>at 17th level.</p>
			<p>Once per day, as a full-round action, an antipaladin may magically call his servant to his side. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the antipaladin's level. The servant immediately appears adjacent to the antipaladin. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels thereafter, for a total of four times per day at 17th level.</p>
			<p>At 11th level, the servant gains the advanced template (see the <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary </i>). At 15th level, an antipaladin's servant gains spell resistance equal to the antipaladin's level + 11.</p>
			<p>Should the antipaladin's fiendish servant die or be banished, the antipaladin may not summon another servant for 30 days or until he gains an antipaladin level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Despair (Su) </b>: At 8th level, enemies within 10 feet of an antipaladin take a -2 penalty on all saving throws. This penalty does not stack with the penalty from aura of cowardice.</p>
			<p>This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Vengeance (Su) </b>: At 11th level, an antipaladin can expend two uses of his smite good ability to grant the ability to smite good to all allies within 10 feet, using his bonuses. Allies must use this smite good ability by the start of the antipaladin's next turn and the bonuses last for 1 minute. Using this ability is a free action. Good creatures gain no benefit from this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Sin (Su) </b>: At 14th level, an antipaladin's weapons are treated as evil-aligned for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. Any attack made against an enemy within 10 feet of him is treated as evil-aligned for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Depravity (Su) </b>: At 17th level, an antipaladin gains DR 5/good. Each enemy within 10 feet takes a -4 penalty on saving throws against compulsion effects. This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Unholy Champion (Su) </b>: At 20th level, an antipaladin becomes a conduit for the might of the dark powers. His DR increases to 10/good. Whenever he uses smite good and successfully strikes an good outsider, the outsider is also subject to a <i>banishment </i>, using his antipaladin level as the caster level (his weapon and unholy symbol automatically count as objects that the subject hates). After the <i>banishment </i>effect and the damage from the attack is resolved, the smite immediately ends. In addition, whenever he channels negative energy or uses touch of corruption to damage a creature, he deals the maximum possible amount.</p>
			<p><b>Code of Conduct </b>: An antipaladin must be of chaotic evil alignment and loses all class features except proficiencies if he willingly and altruistically commits good acts. This does not mean that an antipaladin cannot take actions someone else might qualify as good, only that such actions must always be in service of his own dark ends. An antipaladin's code requires that he place his own interests and desires above all else, as well as impose tyranny, take advantage whenever possible, and punish the good and just, provided such actions don't interfere with his goals.</p>
			<p><b>Associates </b>: While he may adventure with evil or neutral allies, an antipaladin avoids working with good characters or with anyone who consistently attempts to do good deeds. Under exceptional circumstances, an antipaladin can ally with good associates, but only to defeat them from within and bring ruin to their ranks. An antipaladin does not need an atonement spell during such an unusual alliance as long as his nefarious goals are met in the end-evil cares only about results. An antipaladin may accept only henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are chaotic evil.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 14th level, a dread vanguard becomes a true messenger of the forces of darkness he serves. Once per day, the dread vanguard can expend two uses of his touch of corruption ability to mark one location within 60 feet with the stain of evil. This location can be any point in space, but the ability works best if placed on an altar, shrine, or other site important to a community. The location is affected as if by a desecrate spell. Creatures approaching within 30 feet of the site must succeed at a Will save or suffer the effects of crushing despair.</p>
					<p>At 17th level, the dread vanguard can also mark the site with a symbol of pain, and at 20th level, he adds a symbol of weakness. If available, all three of these effects overlap. Creatures must save against each effect individually, and the effects stack. The caster level for all effects is equal to the dread vanguard&#146;s class level. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the antipaladin&#146;s level + his Charisma modifier. A location remains marked in this way for up to 1 day per antipaladin level. During this time, the crushing despair and symbols are triggered when the first target enters each spell&#146;s area. They remain active for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again if targets are within range. If the effects are disabled, they become inactive for 10 minutes, but then can be triggered again as normal. Dispel magic and similar spells suppress the effects, and all effects of dark emissary can be removed by a consecrate spell cast on the location by a cleric of a level equal to or higher than the dread vanguard.</p>
					<p>Allies or evil creatures who serve the same power or organization as the dread vanguard are immune to the crushing despair and symbol effects, and automatically know that the location has been marked for their masters. They can treat this location as very familiar for the purpose of teleport and similar spells and can use scrying and related spells as though they were familiar with any subject within 20 feet of it. At 14th level, a dread vanguard can have one marked site active at a time. At 17th and 20th levels, he can add one additional site that is simultaneously active. Marking a new site beyond this limit ends all effects on the oldest active site. This ability replaces aura of sin.</p>

					<p>A dread vanguard unleashes the powers of his vile masters to strengthen both himself and his allies.</p>
					<p>At 4th level and every 4 level thereafter, a dread vanguard gains one additional use of his touch of corruption ability per day. As a standard action, he can spend a use of his touch of corruption ability to manifest the darkness in his soul as an area of flickering shadows with a 30-foot radius centered on him. These shadows don&#146;t affect visibility. The antipaladin and all allies in the area gain a +1 morale bonus to AC and on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against fear, and also ignore the first 5 points of hardness when attacking unattended inanimate objects. This lasts for 1 minute, as long as the dread vanguard is conscious.</p>
					<p>At 8th level, the aura grants fast healing 3 to the dread vanguard as well as to his allies while they remain within it. Additionally, while this aura is active, the antipaladin can use his touch of corruption ability against any targets within its radius by making a ranged touch attack.</p>
					<p>At 12th level, when he activates this ability, a dread vanguard can choose to increase the radius of one antipaladin aura he possesses to 30 feet. Also, the morale bonus granted to AC and on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against fear increases to +2.</p>
					<p>At 16th level, the fast healing granted by this ability increases to 5. Additionally, the antipaladin&#146;s weapons and those of his allies within the aura&#146;s radius are considered evil for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
					<p>At 20th level, the beacon of evil&#146;s radius increases to 60 feet, and the morale bonus granted to AC and on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against fear increases to +4. Lastly, attacks made by the dread vanguard and his allies within the aura&#146;s radius are infused with pure unholy power, and deal an additional 1d6 points of damage.</p>
					<p>This ability replaces the spells class feature. A dread vanguard does not gain any spells or spellcasting abilities, cannot use spell trigger or spell completion magic items, and does not have a caster level from this class.</p>

For example, the Extra Lay On Hands feat grants an antipaladin 2 additional uses of the touch of corruption class feature.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some antipaladins serve or ally themselves with villains who are bent on earthly conquest. They care nothing for the intricacies of divine spellcasting, but malevolent energy still surrounds them. Whether alone or at the head of a marauding host, these cruel warriors bring suffering and death&#151;but their presence also heralds the coming of a greater evil.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although it is a rare occurrence, paladins do sometimes stray from the path of righteousness. Most of these wayward holy warriors seek out redemption and forgiveness for their misdeeds, regaining their powers through piety, charity, and powerful magic. Yet there are others, the dark and disturbed few, who turn actively to evil, courting the dark powers they once railed against in order to take vengeance on their former brothers. It's said that those who climb the farthest have the farthest to fall, and antipaladins are living proof of this fact, their pride and hatred blinding them to the glory of their forsaken patrons.</p>
			<p>Antipaladins become the antithesis of their former selves. They make pacts with fiends, take the lives of the innocent, and put nothing ahead of their personal power and wealth. Champions of evil, they often lead armies of evil creatures and work with other villains to bring ruin to the holy and tyranny to the weak. Not surprisingly, paladins stop at nothing to put an end to such nefarious antiheroes.</p>
			<p>The antipaladin is an alternate class. Making use of and altering numerous facets of the paladin core class, this villainous warrior can't truly be considered a new character class by its own right. By the changes made here, though, the details and tones of the paladin class are shifted in a completely opposite direction and captures an entirely different fantasy theme, without needlessly designing an entire new class. While a redesign of sorts, this alternate class can be used just as any of the other base classes found in the first part of this chapter.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: Antipaladins are villains at their most dangerous. They care nothing for the lives of others and actively seek to bring death and destruction to ordered society. They rarely travel with those that they do not subjugate, unless as part of a ruse to bring ruin from within.</p>
			<p>As an alternate paladin class, the antipaladin uses Table: Antipaladin to determine its base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, and spells per day. These details, along with the class's new special abilities, can be found on Table 2-13.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Chaotic evil.</p>
			<h>Ex-Antipaladins</h>
			<p>A antipaladin who ceases to be chaotic evil, who willfully commits an good act, or who violates the code of conduct loses all antipaladin spells and class features (including the fiendish boon, but not weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). He may not progress any further in levels as an antipaladin. He regains his abilities and advancement potential if he atones for his violations (see the <i>atonement </i>spell), as appropriate.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Antipaladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Evil (Ex) </b>: The power of an antipaladin's aura of evil (see the <i>detect evil </i>spell) is equal to his antipaladin level. A paladin who uses smite evil on an antipaladin deals 2 points of damage per paladin level on his first successful attack.</p>
			<p><b>Detect Good (Sp) </b>: At will, an antipaladin can use <i>detect good </i>, as the spell. An antipaladin can, as a move action, concentrate on a single item or individual within 60 feet and determine if it is good, learning the strength of its aura as if having studied it for 3 rounds. While focusing on one individual or object, the antipaladin does not detect good in any other object or individual within range.</p>
			<p><b>Smite Good (Su) </b>: Once per day, an antipaladin can call out to the dark powers to crush the forces of good. As a swift action, the antipaladin chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is good, the antipaladin adds his Charisma bonus (if any) on his attack rolls and adds his antipaladin level on all damage rolls made against the target of his smite. If the target of smite good is an outsider with the good subtype, a good-aligned dragon, or a good creature with levels of cleric or paladin, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per level the antipaladin possesses. Regardless of the target, smite good attacks automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess.</p>
			<p>In addition, while smite good is in effect, the antipaladin gains a deflection bonus equal to his Charisma modifier (if any) to his AC against attacks made by the target of the smite. If the antipaladin targets a creature that is not good, the smite is wasted with no effect.</p>
			<p>The smite good effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time the antipaladin rests and regains his uses of this ability. At 4th level, and at every three levels thereafter, the antipaladin may smite good one additional time per day, as indicated on Table 2-13, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Unholy Resilience (Su) </b>: At 2nd level, an antipaladin gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Touch of Corruption (Su) </b>: Beginning at 2nd level, an antipaladin surrounds his hand with a fiendish flame, causing terrible wounds to open on those he touches. Each day he can use this ability a number of times equal to 1/2 his antipaladin level + his Charisma modifier. As a touch attack, an antipaladin can cause 1d6 points of damage for every two antipaladin levels he possesses. Using this ability is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
			<p>Alternatively, an antipaladin can use this power to heal undead creatures, restoring 1d6 hit points for every two levels the antipaladin possesses. This ability is modified by any feat, spell, or effect that specifically works with the lay on hands paladin class feature. For example, the Extra Lay On Hands feat grants an antipaladin 2 additional uses of the touch of corruption class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Cowardice (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, an antipaladin radiates a palpably daunting aura that causes all enemies within 10 feet to take a -4 penalty on saving throws against fear effects. Creatures that are normally immune to fear lose that immunity while within 10 feet of an antipaladin with this ability. This ability functions only while the antipaladin remains conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Plague Bringer (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, the powers of darkness make an antipaladin a beacon of corruption and disease. An antipaladin does not take any damage or take any penalty from diseases. He can still contract diseases and spread them to others, but he is otherwise immune to their effects.</p>
			<p><b>Cruelty (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, an antipaladin can select one cruelty. Each cruelty adds an effect to the antipaladin's touch of corruption ability. Whenever the antipaladin uses touch of corruption to deal damage to one target, the target also receives the additional effect from one of the cruelties possessed by the antipaladin. This choice is made when the touch is used. The target receives a Fortitude save to avoid this cruelty. If the save is successful, the target takes the damage as normal, but not the effects of the cruelty. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the antipaladin's level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. At 3rd level, the antipaladin can select from the following initial cruelties.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Fatigued </i>: The target is fatigued.</li>
				<li><i>Shaken </i>: The target is shaken for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Sickened </i>: The target is sickened for 1 round per level of the antipaladin. At 6th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Dazed </i>: The target is dazed for 1 round.</li>
				<li><i>Diseased </i>: The target contracts a disease, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>contagion </i>, using his antipaladin level as his caster level.</li>
				<li><i>Staggered </i>: The target is staggered for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin. At 9th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Cursed </i>: The target is cursed, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>bestow curse </i>, using his antipaladin level as his caster level.</li>
				<li><i>Exhausted </i>: The target is exhausted. The antipaladin must have the fatigue cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Frightened </i>: The target is frightened for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the shaken cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Nauseated </i>: The target is nauseated for 1 round per three levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the sickened cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Poisoned </i>: The target is poisoned, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>poison </i>, using the antipaladin's level as the caster level. At 12th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Blinded </i>: The target is blinded for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Deafened </i>: The target is deafened for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Paralyzed </i>: The target is paralyzed for 1 round.</li>
				<li><i>Stunned </i>: The target is stunned for 1 round per four levels of the antipaladin. These abilities are not cumulative. For example, a 12th-level antipaladin's touch of corruption ability deals 6d6 points of damage and might also cause the target to become fatigued, dazed, poisoned, or diseased. Once a cruelty is chosen, it can't be changed.</li>
			</list>
			<p><b>Channel Negative Energy (Su) </b>: When an antipaladin reaches 4th level, he gains the supernatural ability to channel negative energy like a cleric. Using this ability consumes two uses of his touch of corruption ability. An antipaladin uses his level as his effective cleric level when channeling negative energy. This is a Charisma-based ability.</p>
			<p><b>Beacon of Evil (Su): </b>A dread vanguard unleashes the powers of his vile masters to strengthen both himself and his allies.</p>
			<p>At 4th level and every 4 level thereafter, a dread vanguard gains one additional use of his touch of corruption ability per day. As a standard action, he can spend a use of his touch of corruption ability to manifest the darkness in his soul as an area of flickering shadows with a 30-foot radius centered on him. These shadows don&#146;t affect visibility. The antipaladin and all allies in the area gain a +1 morale bonus to AC and on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against fear, and also ignore the first 5 points of hardness when attacking unattended inanimate objects. This lasts for 1 minute, as long as the dread vanguard is conscious.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the aura grants fast healing 3 to the dread vanguard as well as to his allies while they remain within it. Additionally, while this aura is active, the antipaladin can use his touch of corruption ability against any targets within its radius by making a ranged touch attack.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, when he activates this ability, a dread vanguard can choose to increase the radius of one antipaladin aura he possesses to 30 feet. Also, the morale bonus granted to AC and on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against fear increases to +2.</p>
			<p>At 16th level, the fast healing granted by this ability increases to 5. Additionally, the antipaladin&#146;s weapons and those of his allies within the aura&#146;s radius are considered evil for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
			<p>At 20th level, the beacon of evil&#146;s radius increases to 60 feet, and the morale bonus granted to AC and on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against fear increases to +4. Lastly, attacks made by the dread vanguard and his allies within the aura&#146;s radius are infused with pure unholy power, and deal an additional 1d6 points of damage.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the spells class feature. A dread vanguard does not gain any spells or spellcasting abilities, cannot use spell trigger or spell completion magic items, and does not have a caster level from this class.</p>
			<p><b>Fiendish Boon (Sp) </b>: Upon reaching 5th level, an antipaladin receives a boon from his dark patrons. This boon can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Bond </b>: The first type of bond allows the antipaladin to enhance his weapon as a standard action by calling upon the aid of a fiendish spirit for 1 minute per antipaladin level. When called, the spirit causes the weapon to shed unholy light as a torch. At 5th level, this spirit grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: <i>anarchic </i>, <i>flaming </i>, <i>flaming burst </i>, <i>keen </i>, <i>speed </i>, <i>unholy </i>, <i>vicious </i>, <i>vorpal </i>, and <i>wounding </i>. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table 15-9 in the <i>Core Rulebook </i>). These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The fiendish spirit imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than the antipaladin but resumes giving bonuses if returned to the antipaladin. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level.</p>
			<p>If a weapon bonded with a fiendish spirit is destroyed, the antipaladin loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until he gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>
			<p><b>Fiendish Servant </b>: The second type of bond allows an antipaladin to gain the service of a fiendish servant. This functions as <i>summon monster III </i>, except the duration is permanent and the antipaladin can only gain the service of a single creature and that creature must either have the chaotic and evil subtypes or it must be a fiendish animal. Once selected, the choice is set, but it may be changed whenever the antipaladin gains a level. Upon reaching 7th level, and every two levels thereafter, the level of the <i>summon monster </i>spell increases by one, to a maximum of <i>summon monster IX </i>at 17th level.</p>
			<p>Once per day, as a full-round action, an antipaladin may magically call his servant to his side. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the antipaladin's level. The servant immediately appears adjacent to the antipaladin. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels thereafter, for a total of four times per day at 17th level.</p>
			<p>At 11th level, the servant gains the advanced template (see the <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary </i>). At 15th level, an antipaladin's servant gains spell resistance equal to the antipaladin's level + 11.</p>
			<p>Should the antipaladin's fiendish servant die or be banished, the antipaladin may not summon another servant for 30 days or until he gains an antipaladin level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Despair (Su) </b>: At 8th level, enemies within 10 feet of an antipaladin take a -2 penalty on all saving throws. This penalty does not stack with the penalty from aura of cowardice.</p>
			<p>This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Vengeance (Su) </b>: At 11th level, an antipaladin can expend two uses of his smite good ability to grant the ability to smite good to all allies within 10 feet, using his bonuses. Allies must use this smite good ability by the start of the antipaladin's next turn and the bonuses last for 1 minute. Using this ability is a free action. Good creatures gain no benefit from this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Dark Emissary (Sp): </b>At 14th level, a dread vanguard becomes a true messenger of the forces of darkness he serves. Once per day, the dread vanguard can expend two uses of his touch of corruption ability to mark one location within 60 feet with the stain of evil. This location can be any point in space, but the ability works best if placed on an altar, shrine, or other site important to a community. The location is affected as if by a desecrate spell. Creatures approaching within 30 feet of the site must succeed at a Will save or suffer the effects of crushing despair.</p>
			<p>At 17th level, the dread vanguard can also mark the site with a symbol of pain, and at 20th level, he adds a symbol of weakness. If available, all three of these effects overlap. Creatures must save against each effect individually, and the effects stack. The caster level for all effects is equal to the dread vanguard&#146;s class level. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the antipaladin&#146;s level + his Charisma modifier. A location remains marked in this way for up to 1 day per antipaladin level. During this time, the crushing despair and symbols are triggered when the first target enters each spell&#146;s area. They remain active for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again if targets are within range. If the effects are disabled, they become inactive for 10 minutes, but then can be triggered again as normal. Dispel magic and similar spells suppress the effects, and all effects of dark emissary can be removed by a consecrate spell cast on the location by a cleric of a level equal to or higher than the dread vanguard.</p>
			<p>Allies or evil creatures who serve the same power or organization as the dread vanguard are immune to the crushing despair and symbol effects, and automatically know that the location has been marked for their masters. They can treat this location as very familiar for the purpose of teleport and similar spells and can use scrying and related spells as though they were familiar with any subject within 20 feet of it. At 14th level, a dread vanguard can have one marked site active at a time. At 17th and 20th levels, he can add one additional site that is simultaneously active. Marking a new site beyond this limit ends all effects on the oldest active site. This ability replaces aura of sin.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Depravity (Su) </b>: At 17th level, an antipaladin gains DR 5/good. Each enemy within 10 feet takes a -4 penalty on saving throws against compulsion effects. This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Unholy Champion (Su) </b>: At 20th level, an antipaladin becomes a conduit for the might of the dark powers. His DR increases to 10/good. Whenever he uses smite good and successfully strikes an good outsider, the outsider is also subject to a <i>banishment </i>, using his antipaladin level as the caster level (his weapon and unholy symbol automatically count as objects that the subject hates). After the <i>banishment </i>effect and the damage from the attack is resolved, the smite immediately ends. In addition, whenever he channels negative energy or uses touch of corruption to damage a creature, he deals the maximum possible amount.</p>
			<p><b>Code of Conduct </b>: An antipaladin must be of chaotic evil alignment and loses all class features except proficiencies if he willingly and altruistically commits good acts. This does not mean that an antipaladin cannot take actions someone else might qualify as good, only that such actions must always be in service of his own dark ends. An antipaladin's code requires that he place his own interests and desires above all else, as well as impose tyranny, take advantage whenever possible, and punish the good and just, provided such actions don't interfere with his goals.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>An antipaladin must be of chaotic evil alignment and loses all class features except proficiencies if he willingly and altruistically commits good acts. This does not mean that an antipaladin cannot take actions someone else might qualify as good, only that such actions must always be in service of his own dark ends. An antipaladin's code requires that he place his own interests and desires above all else, as well as impose tyranny, take advantage whenever possible, and punish the good and just, provided such actions don't interfere with his goals.</p>

				<name type="string">Fiendish Servant</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>The second type of bond allows an antipaladin to gain the service of a fiendish servant. This functions as <i>summon monster III </i>, except the duration is permanent and the antipaladin can only gain the service of a single creature and that creature must either have the chaotic and evil subtypes or it must be a fiendish animal. Once selected, the choice is set, but it may be changed whenever the antipaladin gains a level. Upon reaching 7th level, and every two levels thereafter, the level of the <i>summon monster </i>spell increases by one, to a maximum of <i>summon monster IX </i>at 17th level. Once per day, as a full-round action, an antipaladin may magically call his servant to his side. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the antipaladin's level. The servant immediately appears adjacent to the antipaladin. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels thereafter, for a total of four times per day at 17th level. At 11th level, the servant gains the advanced template (see the <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary </i>). At 15th level, an antipaladin's servant gains spell resistance equal to the antipaladin's level + 11. Should the antipaladin's fiendish servant die or be banished, the antipaladin may not summon another servant for 30 days or until he gains an antipaladin level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>

				<name type="string">Weapon Bond</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>The first type of bond allows the antipaladin to enhance his weapon as a standard action by calling upon the aid of a fiendish spirit for 1 minute per antipaladin level. When called, the spirit causes the weapon to shed unholy light as a torch. At 5th level, this spirit grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: <i>anarchic </i>, <i>flaming </i>, <i>flaming burst </i>, <i>keen </i>, <i>speed </i>, <i>unholy </i>, <i>vicious </i>, <i>vorpal </i>, and <i>wounding </i>. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table 15-9 in the <i>Core Rulebook </i>). These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The fiendish spirit imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than the antipaladin but resumes giving bonuses if returned to the antipaladin. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level. If a weapon bonded with a fiendish spirit is destroyed, the antipaladin loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until he gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>

					<p>Beginning at 4th level, an antipaladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells which are drawn from the antipaladin spell list presented in Chapter 5. An antipaladin must choose and prepare his spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, an antipaladin must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an antipaladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, an antipaladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is the same as that of a paladin and is given on Table 2-13. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-3 in the Core Rulebook). When Table 2-13 indicates that the antipaladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level. An antipaladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. An antipaladin may prepare and cast any spell on the antipaladin spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation. Through 3rd level, an antipaladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his antipaladin level -3.</p>

As a touch attack, an antipaladin can cause 1d6 points of damage for every two antipaladin levels he possesses. Using this ability is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Alternatively, an antipaladin can use this power to heal undead creatures, restoring 1d6 hit points for every two levels the antipaladin possesses. This ability is modified by any feat, spell, or effect that specifically works with the lay on hands paladin class feature.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Blighted myrmidons carry the seed of rot in their black hearts and sap life from the natural world.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although it is a rare occurrence, paladins do sometimes stray from the path of righteousness. Most of these wayward holy warriors seek out redemption and forgiveness for their misdeeds, regaining their powers through piety, charity, and powerful magic. Yet there are others, the dark and disturbed few, who turn actively to evil, courting the dark powers they once railed against in order to take vengeance on their former brothers. It's said that those who climb the farthest have the farthest to fall, and antipaladins are living proof of this fact, their pride and hatred blinding them to the glory of their forsaken patrons.</p>
			<p>Antipaladins become the antithesis of their former selves. They make pacts with fiends, take the lives of the innocent, and put nothing ahead of their personal power and wealth. Champions of evil, they often lead armies of evil creatures and work with other villains to bring ruin to the holy and tyranny to the weak. Not surprisingly, paladins stop at nothing to put an end to such nefarious antiheroes.</p>
			<p>The antipaladin is an alternate class. Making use of and altering numerous facets of the paladin core class, this villainous warrior can't truly be considered a new character class by its own right. By the changes made here, though, the details and tones of the paladin class are shifted in a completely opposite direction and captures an entirely different fantasy theme, without needlessly designing an entire new class. While a redesign of sorts, this alternate class can be used just as any of the other base classes found in the first part of this chapter.</p>
			<p><b>Role </b>: Antipaladins are villains at their most dangerous. They care nothing for the lives of others and actively seek to bring death and destruction to ordered society. They rarely travel with those that they do not subjugate, unless as part of a ruse to bring ruin from within.</p>
			<p>As an alternate paladin class, the antipaladin uses Table: Antipaladin to determine its base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, and spells per day. These details, along with the class's new special abilities, can be found on Table 2-13.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment </b>: Chaotic evil.</p>
			<h>Ex-Antipaladins</h>
			<p>A antipaladin who ceases to be chaotic evil, who willfully commits an good act, or who violates the code of conduct loses all antipaladin spells and class features (including the fiendish boon, but not weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). He may not progress any further in levels as an antipaladin. He regains his abilities and advancement potential if he atones for his violations (see the <i>atonement </i>spell), as appropriate.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Antipaladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Evil (Ex) </b>: The power of an antipaladin's aura of evil (see the <i>detect evil </i>spell) is equal to his antipaladin level. A paladin who uses smite evil on an antipaladin deals 2 points of damage per paladin level on his first successful attack.</p>
			<p><b>Detect Good (Sp) </b>: At will, an antipaladin can use <i>detect good </i>, as the spell. An antipaladin can, as a move action, concentrate on a single item or individual within 60 feet and determine if it is good, learning the strength of its aura as if having studied it for 3 rounds. While focusing on one individual or object, the antipaladin does not detect good in any other object or individual within range.</p>
			<p><b>Smite Good (Su) </b>: Once per day, an antipaladin can call out to the dark powers to crush the forces of good. As a swift action, the antipaladin chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is good, the antipaladin adds his Charisma bonus (if any) on his attack rolls and adds his antipaladin level on all damage rolls made against the target of his smite. If the target of smite good is an outsider with the good subtype, a good-aligned dragon, or a good creature with levels of cleric or paladin, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per level the antipaladin possesses. Regardless of the target, smite good attacks automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess.</p>
			<p>In addition, while smite good is in effect, the antipaladin gains a deflection bonus equal to his Charisma modifier (if any) to his AC against attacks made by the target of the smite. If the antipaladin targets a creature that is not good, the smite is wasted with no effect.</p>
			<p>The smite good effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time the antipaladin rests and regains his uses of this ability. At 4th level, and at every three levels thereafter, the antipaladin may smite good one additional time per day, as indicated on Table 2-13, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Smite Nature (Su): </b>A blighted myrmidon can drain the life from a creature tied to nature. As a swift action, the blighted myrmidon chooses one target within sight to smite. Regardless of its alignment, if the target is an animal, plant, or vermin, the blighted myrmidon adds her Charisma bonus (if any) on her attack rolls and adds her blighted myrmidon level on damage rolls against the target of her smite. If the target of smite nature is an elemental, a fey, or a creature with levels of druid, hunter, ranger, or shifter, the bonus on damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per class level the blighted myrmidon has. This ability otherwise functions as smite good.</p>
			<p>This alters smite good.</p>
			<p><b>Unholy Resilience (Su) </b>: At 2nd level, an antipaladin gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Touch of Corruption (Su) </b>: Beginning at 2nd level, an antipaladin surrounds his hand with a fiendish flame, causing terrible wounds to open on those he touches. Each day he can use this ability a number of times equal to 1/2 his antipaladin level + his Charisma modifier. As a touch attack, an antipaladin can cause 1d6 points of damage for every two antipaladin levels he possesses. Using this ability is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
			<p>Alternatively, an antipaladin can use this power to heal undead creatures, restoring 1d6 hit points for every two levels the antipaladin possesses. This ability is modified by any feat, spell, or effect that specifically works with the lay on hands paladin class feature. For example, the Extra Lay On Hands feat grants an antipaladin 2 additional uses of the touch of corruption class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Cowardice (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, an antipaladin radiates a palpably daunting aura that causes all enemies within 10 feet to take a -4 penalty on saving throws against fear effects. Creatures that are normally immune to fear lose that immunity while within 10 feet of an antipaladin with this ability. This ability functions only while the antipaladin remains conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Plague Bringer (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, the powers of darkness make an antipaladin a beacon of corruption and disease. An antipaladin does not take any damage or take any penalty from diseases. He can still contract diseases and spread them to others, but he is otherwise immune to their effects.</p>
			<p><b>Cruelty (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, an antipaladin can select one cruelty. Each cruelty adds an effect to the antipaladin's touch of corruption ability. Whenever the antipaladin uses touch of corruption to deal damage to one target, the target also receives the additional effect from one of the cruelties possessed by the antipaladin. This choice is made when the touch is used. The target receives a Fortitude save to avoid this cruelty. If the save is successful, the target takes the damage as normal, but not the effects of the cruelty. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the antipaladin's level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. At 3rd level, the antipaladin can select from the following initial cruelties.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Fatigued </i>: The target is fatigued.</li>
				<li><i>Shaken </i>: The target is shaken for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Sickened </i>: The target is sickened for 1 round per level of the antipaladin. At 6th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Dazed </i>: The target is dazed for 1 round.</li>
				<li><i>Diseased </i>: The target contracts a disease, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>contagion </i>, using his antipaladin level as his caster level.</li>
				<li><i>Staggered </i>: The target is staggered for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin. At 9th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Cursed </i>: The target is cursed, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>bestow curse </i>, using his antipaladin level as his caster level.</li>
				<li><i>Exhausted </i>: The target is exhausted. The antipaladin must have the fatigue cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Frightened </i>: The target is frightened for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the shaken cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Nauseated </i>: The target is nauseated for 1 round per three levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the sickened cruelty before selecting this cruelty.</li>
				<li><i>Poisoned </i>: The target is poisoned, as if the antipaladin had cast <i>poison </i>, using the antipaladin's level as the caster level. At 12th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.</li>
				<li><i>Blinded </i>: The target is blinded for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Deafened </i>: The target is deafened for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.</li>
				<li><i>Paralyzed </i>: The target is paralyzed for 1 round.</li>
				<li><i>Stunned </i>: The target is stunned for 1 round per four levels of the antipaladin. These abilities are not cumulative. For example, a 12th-level antipaladin's touch of corruption ability deals 6d6 points of damage and might also cause the target to become fatigued, dazed, poisoned, or diseased. Once a cruelty is chosen, it can't be changed.</li>
			</list>
			<p><b>Channel Negative Energy (Su) </b>: When an antipaladin reaches 4th level, he gains the supernatural ability to channel negative energy like a cleric. Using this ability consumes two uses of his touch of corruption ability. An antipaladin uses his level as his effective cleric level when channeling negative energy. This is a Charisma-based ability.</p>
			<p><b>Spells </b>: Beginning at 4th level, an antipaladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells which are drawn from the antipaladin spell list presented in Chapter 5. An antipaladin must choose and prepare his spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, an antipaladin must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an antipaladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the antipaladin's Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, an antipaladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is the same as that of a paladin and is given on Table 2-13. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-3 in the Core Rulebook). When Table 2-13 indicates that the antipaladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level.</p>
			<p>An antipaladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. An antipaladin may prepare and cast any spell on the antipaladin spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
			<p>Through 3rd level, an antipaladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his antipaladin level -3.</p>
			<p><b>Corrupted Companion (Sp): </b>At 5th level, a blighted myrmidon can call upon a corrupted servant of nature. When the blighted myrmidon chooses the second fiendish boon option, it functions as a summon nature&#146;s ally spell of the appropriate level. This ability otherwise functions as the standard fiendish boon antipaladin class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Despair (Su) </b>: At 8th level, enemies within 10 feet of an antipaladin take a -2 penalty on all saving throws. This penalty does not stack with the penalty from aura of cowardice.</p>
			<p>This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Feed on Decay (Ex): </b>At 10th level, a blighted myrmidon draws strength from corrupting the natural world. When the blighted myrmidon damages a creature with her smite nature ability, she gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws for 1 round.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Decay (Su): </b>At 11th level, as a free action, a blighted myrmidon can expend two uses of her smite nature ability to generate an aura of decay with a range of 10 feet for 1 minute. Living foes of the blighted myrmidon within the aura take 3d6 points of damage unless they succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = half the blighted myrmidon&#146;s level + her Charisma modifier) for half damage. If an elemental, a fey, or a creature with levels in druid, hunter, ranger, or shifter takes damage from aura of decay, the blighted myrmidon regains a number of hit points equal to half the amount of damage the creature takes; this doesn&#146;t stack if multiple such creatures are in the aura.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Sin (Su) </b>: At 14th level, an antipaladin's weapons are treated as evil-aligned for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. Any attack made against an enemy within 10 feet of him is treated as evil-aligned for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Enervating Touch (Su): </b>At 15th level, when she damages a creature with her touch of corruption, a blighted myrmidon can suppress the vital force of her target for 1 round per level. While affected, when the target regains hit points, it regains only half the number of hit points it would otherwise receive, and it can&#146;t gain temporary hit points. The target can attempt a Fortitude save (DC = half the blighted myrmidon&#146;s level + her Charisma modifier) to negate this effect.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Depravity (Su) </b>: At 17th level, an antipaladin gains DR 5/good. Each enemy within 10 feet takes a -4 penalty on saving throws against compulsion effects. This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
			<p><b>Unnatural Champion (Ex): </b>At 20th level, when a blighted myrmidon uses smite nature and strikes an elemental or fey creature with the extraplanar subtype, the target is also subject to the effects of a banishment spell, using her blighted myrmidon level as her caster level, and her weapon and unholy symbol automatically count as objects that the subject hates. This ability otherwise functions as unholy champion.</p>
			<p><b>Code of Conduct </b>: An antipaladin must be of chaotic evil alignment and loses all class features except proficiencies if he willingly and altruistically commits good acts. This does not mean that an antipaladin cannot take actions someone else might qualify as good, only that such actions must always be in service of his own dark ends. An antipaladin's code requires that he place his own interests and desires above all else, as well as impose tyranny, take advantage whenever possible, and punish the good and just, provided such actions don't interfere with his goals.</p>
			<p><b>Associates </b>: While he may adventure with evil or neutral allies, an antipaladin avoids working with good characters or with anyone who consistently attempts to do good deeds. Under exceptional circumstances, an antipaladin can ally with good associates, but only to defeat them from within and bring ruin to their ranks. An antipaladin does not need an atonement spell during such an unusual alliance as long as his nefarious goals are met in the end-evil cares only about results. An antipaladin may accept only henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are chaotic evil.</p>
