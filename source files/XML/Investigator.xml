				<name type="string">Alchemy</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
					<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
					<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
					<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
					<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
					<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
					<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
					<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>

				<name type="string">Inspiration</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
					<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
					<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>An investigator has a deep understanding and appreciation for poisons. At 2nd level, he cannot accidentally poison himself when applying poison to a weapon. If the investigator spends 1 minute physically examining the poison, he can attempt a Knowledge (nature) check to identify any natural poison or Knowledge (arcana) check to identify any magical poison (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC). Lastly, once a poison is identified, he can spend 1 minute and attempt a Craft (alchemy) check (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC) to neutralize 1 dose of the poison. Success renders the dose harmless. The investigator has no chance of accidentally poisoning himself when examining or attempting to neutralize a poison.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
					<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>-</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon. Mixing gumption and learnedness into a personal alchemy of daring, investigators are full of surprises. Observing the world around them, they gain valuable knowledge about the situation they&#146;re in, process that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut to the quick of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators are always evaluating situations they encounter, sizing up potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers, all while using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to find solutions to the most perplexing problems.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Investigators live to solve mysteries and find inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as advisors and support for their adventuring parties, but can take center stage when knowledge and cunning are needed. No slouches in battle, they know how to make surprise attacks and use inspiration to bring those attacks home.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Alchemist and rogue.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Investigators are proficient with simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, short sword, and sword caneUE. They are proficient in light armors, but not shields.</p>
			<p><b>Alchemy (Su): </b>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
			<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
			<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
			<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
			<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
			<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
			<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
			<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
			<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>An investigator adds 1/2 his level to Perception skill checks made to locate traps and to Disable Device checks (minimum 1). An investigator can use Disable Device to disarm magical traps.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Lore (Ex): </b>An investigator has a deep understanding and appreciation for poisons. At 2nd level, he cannot accidentally poison himself when applying poison to a weapon. If the investigator spends 1 minute physically examining the poison, he can attempt a Knowledge (nature) check to identify any natural poison or Knowledge (arcana) check to identify any magical poison (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC). Lastly, once a poison is identified, he can spend 1 minute and attempt a Craft (alchemy) check (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC) to neutralize 1 dose of the poison. Success renders the dose harmless. The investigator has no chance of accidentally poisoning himself when examining or attempting to neutralize a poison.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Resistance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, an investigator gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against poison. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level, and to +6 at 8th level. At 11th level, the investigator becomes completely immune to poison.</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talent (Ex or Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can only be selected once.</p>
			<p>Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an investigator&#146;s studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p>See the Investigator Talents section for a full list of Talents from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Keen Recollection: </b>At 3rd level, an investigator can attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Trap Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, an investigator gains an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps, granting him a +1 bonus on Ref lex saving throws to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by traps. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1 (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).</p>
			<p><b>Studied Combat (Ex): </b>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Strike (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a free action, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.</p>
			<p>If the investigator&#146;s attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to make an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual &#150;4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.</p>
			<p>The investigator must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. An investigator cannot use studied strike against a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Alchemy (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can create alchemical items with astounding speed. It takes an investigator half the normal amount of time to create alchemical items. He can also apply poison to a weapon as a move action instead of a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>True Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an investigator can use inspiration on all skill checks&#151;even ones he isn&#146;t trained in&#151;and all ability checks without spending inspiration.</p>
			<p>In addition, whenever he expends inspiration on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can affect this. If using the amazing inspiration investigator talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If using this with empathy, tenacious inspiration, underworld inspiration, or a similar talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the higher of the two results.</p>

					<p>When a toxin codexer prepares his extracts, he can use his slots to prepare short-lived poisons instead of extracts. The following poisons can be prepared into extract slots:</p>
					<p>1st&#151;arsenic, giant wasp poison, medium spider venom; 2nd&#151;black adder venom, id moss, striped toadstool; 3rd&#151; blue whinnis, lich dust, sassone leaf residue; 4th&#151;dark reaver powder, purple worm poison, third eye; 5th&#151;deathblade, hemlock, witch hunter&#146;s sword; 6th&#151;black lotus extract, dragon bile, king&#146;s sleep.</p>
					<p>Additional poison selections can be added to this list with GM approval.</p>
					<p>The Fortitude save DC of these poisons is 10 + the toxin codexer&#146;s Intelligence modifier + the extract level of the poison. Poisons created in this way are unstable and become inert after 1 day if not used. Once the poison is administered to a target, the duration is as normal for that poison&#146;s type, even if longer than 1 day. These poisons can be applied to weapons (if applicable) only by the toxin codexer, unless he has the infusion alchemist discovery.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level, a toxin codexer learns to unlock both the beneficial and detrimental side effects of his poisons. These effects apply even if the target succeeds at her save against the poison, but they still count as poison effects. A modified toxin becomes inert if not used within 1 hour.</p>
					<p>As a move action, the toxin codexer can expend one use of inspiration to apply one of the following effects to a poison in his possession, choosing either the benefit or the detriment when an effect has both options. These effects last for a number of rounds equal to the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier unless otherwise stated.</p>

					<p>At 6th level, the toxin codexer can also choose from the following effects:</p>

						<li>Affect a target so the first time she takes damage each round, she takes an additional 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. This is a pain effect.</li>

					<p>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
					<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>While most investigators are well versed in the knowledge of poisons, the toxin codexer has made it a way of life. He meticulously seeks out new poisons and catalogs their effects, both those that are harmful and those that are potentially beneficial. A toxin codexer&#146;s detailed understanding of how his toxins work allows him to blend them with exact precision, creating even more deadly venoms or providing painful medicines for those in need.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon. Mixing gumption and learnedness into a personal alchemy of daring, investigators are full of surprises. Observing the world around them, they gain valuable knowledge about the situation they&#146;re in, process that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut to the quick of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators are always evaluating situations they encounter, sizing up potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers, all while using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to find solutions to the most perplexing problems.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Investigators live to solve mysteries and find inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as advisors and support for their adventuring parties, but can take center stage when knowledge and cunning are needed. No slouches in battle, they know how to make surprise attacks and use inspiration to bring those attacks home.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Alchemist and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Investigator's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Investigators are proficient with simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, short sword, and sword caneUE. They are proficient in light armors, but not shields.</p>
			<p><b>Alchemy (Su): </b>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
			<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
			<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
			<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
			<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
			<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
			<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
			<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
			<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Lore (Ex): </b>An investigator has a deep understanding and appreciation for poisons. At 2nd level, he cannot accidentally poison himself when applying poison to a weapon. If the investigator spends 1 minute physically examining the poison, he can attempt a Knowledge (nature) check to identify any natural poison or Knowledge (arcana) check to identify any magical poison (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC). Lastly, once a poison is identified, he can spend 1 minute and attempt a Craft (alchemy) check (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC) to neutralize 1 dose of the poison. Success renders the dose harmless. The investigator has no chance of accidentally poisoning himself when examining or attempting to neutralize a poison.</p>
			<p><b>Synthetic Venom (Ex): </b>When a toxin codexer prepares his extracts, he can use his slots to prepare short-lived poisons instead of extracts. The following poisons can be prepared into extract slots:</p>
			<p>1st&#151;arsenic, giant wasp poison, medium spider venom; 2nd&#151;black adder venom, id moss, striped toadstool; 3rd&#151; blue whinnis, lich dust, sassone leaf residue; 4th&#151;dark reaver powder, purple worm poison, third eye; 5th&#151;deathblade, hemlock, witch hunter&#146;s sword; 6th&#151;black lotus extract, dragon bile, king&#146;s sleep.</p>
			<p>Additional poison selections can be added to this list with GM approval.</p>
			<p>The Fortitude save DC of these poisons is 10 + the toxin codexer&#146;s Intelligence modifier + the extract level of the poison. Poisons created in this way are unstable and become inert after 1 day if not used. Once the poison is administered to a target, the duration is as normal for that poison&#146;s type, even if longer than 1 day. These poisons can be applied to weapons (if applicable) only by the toxin codexer, unless he has the infusion alchemist discovery.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Resistance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, an investigator gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against poison. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level, and to +6 at 8th level. At 11th level, the investigator becomes completely immune to poison.</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talent (Ex or Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can only be selected once.</p>
			<p>Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an investigator&#146;s studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p>See the Investigator Talents section for a full list of Talents from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Modify Toxin (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a toxin codexer learns to unlock both the beneficial and detrimental side effects of his poisons. These effects apply even if the target succeeds at her save against the poison, but they still count as poison effects. A modified toxin becomes inert if not used within 1 hour.</p>
			<p>As a move action, the toxin codexer can expend one use of inspiration to apply one of the following effects to a poison in his possession, choosing either the benefit or the detriment when an effect has both options. These effects last for a number of rounds equal to the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier unless otherwise stated.</p>
			<list>
				<li>Grant a +2 alchemical bonus or impose a &#150;2 alchemical penalty on saving throws against exhaustion, fatigue, and sleep effects.</li>
				<li>Grant a +4 alchemical bonus or impose a &#150;4 alchemical penalty on saving throws against effects with the pain descriptor.</li>
			</list>
			<p>At 6th level, the toxin codexer can also choose from the following effects:</p>
			<list>
				<li>Affect a target so the first time she takes damage each round, she takes an additional 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. This is a pain effect.</li>
				<li>Inflict or remove the fatigued condition.</li>
			</list>
			<p>At 9th level, the toxin codexer can also choose from the following effects:</p>
			<list>
				<li>Deal 1 point of bleed damage or cure any ongoing bleed effects.</li>
				<li>Cure one disease or poison whose save DC does not exceed that of the modified poison. This has no effect on magical curses, diseases, or poisons.</li>
			</list>
			<p>At 12th level, the toxin codexer can also choose from the following effects:</p>
			<list>
				<li>Cure one magical disease or poison whose save DC does not exceed that of the modified poison.</li>
				<li>Bestow a 30% spell failure chance on a target.</li>
			</list>
			<p><b>Studied Combat (Ex): </b>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Strike (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a free action, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.</p>
			<p>If the investigator&#146;s attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to make an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual &#150;4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.</p>
			<p>The investigator must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. An investigator cannot use studied strike against a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Alchemy (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can create alchemical items with astounding speed. It takes an investigator half the normal amount of time to create alchemical items. He can also apply poison to a weapon as a move action instead of a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>True Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an investigator can use inspiration on all skill checks&#151;even ones he isn&#146;t trained in&#151;and all ability checks without spending inspiration.</p>
			<p>In addition, whenever he expends inspiration on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can affect this. If using the amazing inspiration investigator talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If using this with empathy, tenacious inspiration, underworld inspiration, or a similar talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the higher of the two results.</p>

					<p>A Tekritanin arbiter gains Tekritanin as a bonus language. Tekritanin is a fluid and evolving hybrid tongue which shares roots with many modern languages. When the arbiter speaks Tekritanin, any creature that speaks a common Inner Sea human language will understand him well enough to allow the arbiter to use the Diplomacy skill or affect the creature with language-dependent effects. At the GM&#146;s discretion, some human languages might be too divergent or unrelated to Tekritanin to use this ability immediately. In this case, the arbiter must interact with creatures speaking the language for at least 1 hour to permanently apply this ability to the foreign language. A Tekritanin arbiter adds 1/2 his level (minimum 1) to Linguistics checks.</p>

					<p>A Tekritanin arbiter learns to forge lasting harmony between enemies. At 2nd level, whenever the arbiter uses the Diplomacy skill to improve the starting attitude of a creature, that attitude shift lasts for 24 hours instead of 1d4 hours, barring any circumstance or event that causes it to be decreased. If the arbiter spends 1 minute continuously interacting with a creature, he can attempt a Sense Motive check (DC = 10 + the creature&#146;s Bluff skill bonus) to identify the creature&#146;s starting attitude (per the Diplomacy skill) in regard to all other creatures present (including himself ). With this understanding, the arbiter can use the Diplomacy skill to improve a target&#146;s attitude toward any other creature present. This functions as if using the Diplomacy skill to improve the target&#146;s attitude toward the arbiter, but instead uses the Diplomacy DC determined by the target&#146;s starting attitude toward the creature of the arbiter&#146;s choosing.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level, a Tekritanin arbiter learns to speak one language with the skill of a native speaker. He chooses one language he knows and gains a +1 bonus on Disguise checks to appear as an individual native to any region where the language is primarily spoken. In addition, he gains a +1 bonus on both Diplomacy checks to change initial attitudes and Sense Motive checks to detect falsehoods when dealing with individuals with the selected language as their native language. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1 and the Tekritanin arbiter can select one additional language that his bonuses apply to, up to a maximum of +6 each for six languages at 18th level.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
					<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The Tekritanin League facilitated trade and settled disputes between a vast array of diverse cultures. The arbiters were the first line of diplomatic defense, solving problems before they could become disruptive.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon. Mixing gumption and learnedness into a personal alchemy of daring, investigators are full of surprises. Observing the world around them, they gain valuable knowledge about the situation they&#146;re in, process that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut to the quick of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators are always evaluating situations they encounter, sizing up potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers, all while using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to find solutions to the most perplexing problems.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Investigators live to solve mysteries and find inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as advisors and support for their adventuring parties, but can take center stage when knowledge and cunning are needed. No slouches in battle, they know how to make surprise attacks and use inspiration to bring those attacks home.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Alchemist and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Investigator's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Investigators are proficient with simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, short sword, and sword caneUE. They are proficient in light armors, but not shields.</p>
			<p><b>Alchemy (Su): </b>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
			<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
			<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
			<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
			<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
			<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
			<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
			<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
			<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Tekritanin (Ex): </b>A Tekritanin arbiter gains Tekritanin as a bonus language. Tekritanin is a fluid and evolving hybrid tongue which shares roots with many modern languages. When the arbiter speaks Tekritanin, any creature that speaks a common Inner Sea human language will understand him well enough to allow the arbiter to use the Diplomacy skill or affect the creature with language-dependent effects. At the GM&#146;s discretion, some human languages might be too divergent or unrelated to Tekritanin to use this ability immediately. In this case, the arbiter must interact with creatures speaking the language for at least 1 hour to permanently apply this ability to the foreign language. A Tekritanin arbiter adds 1/2 his level (minimum 1) to Linguistics checks.</p>
			<p><b>Expert Mediator (Ex): </b>A Tekritanin arbiter learns to forge lasting harmony between enemies. At 2nd level, whenever the arbiter uses the Diplomacy skill to improve the starting attitude of a creature, that attitude shift lasts for 24 hours instead of 1d4 hours, barring any circumstance or event that causes it to be decreased. If the arbiter spends 1 minute continuously interacting with a creature, he can attempt a Sense Motive check (DC = 10 + the creature&#146;s Bluff skill bonus) to identify the creature&#146;s starting attitude (per the Diplomacy skill) in regard to all other creatures present (including himself ). With this understanding, the arbiter can use the Diplomacy skill to improve a target&#146;s attitude toward any other creature present. This functions as if using the Diplomacy skill to improve the target&#146;s attitude toward the arbiter, but instead uses the Diplomacy DC determined by the target&#146;s starting attitude toward the creature of the arbiter&#146;s choosing.</p>
			<p><b>Hidden Meaning (Ex): </b>A Tekritanin arbiter&#146;s deep knowledge of language provides him protection from effects that require communication. At 2nd level, he gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against language-dependent effects. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level and to +6 at 8th level. At 11th level, he gains immunity to language-dependent effects.</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talent (Ex or Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can only be selected once.</p>
			<p>Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an investigator&#146;s studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p>See the Investigator Talents section for a full list of Talents from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Keen Recollection: </b>At 3rd level, an investigator can attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Fluent Speaker (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a Tekritanin arbiter learns to speak one language with the skill of a native speaker. He chooses one language he knows and gains a +1 bonus on Disguise checks to appear as an individual native to any region where the language is primarily spoken. In addition, he gains a +1 bonus on both Diplomacy checks to change initial attitudes and Sense Motive checks to detect falsehoods when dealing with individuals with the selected language as their native language. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1 and the Tekritanin arbiter can select one additional language that his bonuses apply to, up to a maximum of +6 each for six languages at 18th level.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Combat (Ex): </b>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Strike (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a free action, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.</p>
			<p>If the investigator&#146;s attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to make an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual &#150;4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.</p>
			<p>The investigator must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. An investigator cannot use studied strike against a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Alchemy (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can create alchemical items with astounding speed. It takes an investigator half the normal amount of time to create alchemical items. He can also apply poison to a weapon as a move action instead of a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>True Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an investigator can use inspiration on all skill checks&#151;even ones he isn&#146;t trained in&#151;and all ability checks without spending inspiration.</p>
			<p>In addition, whenever he expends inspiration on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can affect this. If using the amazing inspiration investigator talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If using this with empathy, tenacious inspiration, underworld inspiration, or a similar talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the higher of the two results.</p>

					<p>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
					<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
					<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
					<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
					<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura.

					<p>At 4th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a free action, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level).

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Black powder and firearms are a natural extension of the alchemical experimentation that investigators use on a regular basis. Steel hounds are investigators who have taken to using firearms in place of the more mundane weapons their counterparts favor.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon. Mixing gumption and learnedness into a personal alchemy of daring, investigators are full of surprises. Observing the world around them, they gain valuable knowledge about the situation they&#146;re in, process that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut to the quick of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators are always evaluating situations they encounter, sizing up potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers, all while using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to find solutions to the most perplexing problems.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Investigators live to solve mysteries and find inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as advisors and support for their adventuring parties, but can take center stage when knowledge and cunning are needed. No slouches in battle, they know how to make surprise attacks and use inspiration to bring those attacks home.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Alchemist and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Investigator's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Steel hounds are proficient with simple weapons, plus the rapier, the sap, and one type of firearm selected at 1st level. They are prof icient in light armor, but not shields. This replaces the investigator&#146;s weapon and armor proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Alchemy (Su): </b>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
			<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
			<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
			<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
			<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
			<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
			<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
			<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
			<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>An investigator adds 1/2 his level to Perception skill checks made to locate traps and to Disable Device checks (minimum 1). An investigator can use Disable Device to disarm magical traps.</p>
			<p><b>Packing Heat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, the steel hound gains both the Amateur Gunslinger and Gunsmithing feats as bonus feats. He also gains a battered gun identical to the one gained by the gunslinger. This ability replaces poison lore.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Resistance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, an investigator gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against poison. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level, and to +6 at 8th level. At 11th level, the investigator becomes completely immune to poison.</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talent (Ex or Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can only be selected once.</p>
			<p>Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an investigator&#146;s studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p>See the Investigator Talents section for a full list of Talents from all sources.</p>
			<p>The steel hound can select the Extra Grit or Rapid Reload feats in place of an investigator talent.</p>
			<p><b>Keen Recollection: </b>At 3rd level, an investigator can attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Trap Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, an investigator gains an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps, granting him a +1 bonus on Ref lex saving throws to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by traps. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1 (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).</p>
			<p><b>Studied Combat (Ex): </b>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Strike (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a free action, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.</p>
			<p>If the investigator&#146;s attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to make an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual &#150;4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.</p>
			<p>The investigator must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. An investigator cannot use studied strike against a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Shot in the Dark (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a steel hound gains the following deed. This deed works and interacts with grit the same way as gunslinger deeds, but only the steel hound can use it. If the steel hound also has levels in gunslinger, he can spend grit points from that class to use this deed.</p>
			<p><i>Blind Shot (Su): </i>A steel hound can spend 1 grit point to ignore all miss chances due to concealment when making firearm attacks. This effect lasts until the end of his turn. This ability allows the steel hound to ignore concealment, but does not reveal or allow him to see the enemy. This ability replaces swift alchemy.</p>
			<p><b>Talented Shot (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a steel hound can select a gunslinger deed in place of an investigator talent. He can select from any deed available to a gunslinger of his investigator level &#150; 4.</p>
			<p><b>True Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an investigator can use inspiration on all skill checks&#151;even ones he isn&#146;t trained in&#151;and all ability checks without spending inspiration.</p>
			<p>In addition, whenever he expends inspiration on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can affect this. If using the amazing inspiration investigator talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If using this with empathy, tenacious inspiration, underworld inspiration, or a similar talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the higher of the two results.</p>

				<name type="string">Alchemy</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
					<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
					<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
					<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
					<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
					<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
					<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
					<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>

				<name type="string">Inspiration</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
					<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
					<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>

					<p>An investigator has a deep understanding and appreciation for poisons. At 2nd level, he cannot accidentally poison himself when applying poison to a weapon. If the investigator spends 1 minute physically examining the poison, he can attempt a Knowledge (nature) check to identify any natural poison or Knowledge (arcana) check to identify any magical poison (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC). Lastly, once a poison is identified, he can spend 1 minute and attempt a Craft (alchemy) check (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC) to neutralize 1 dose of the poison. Success renders the dose harmless. The investigator has no chance of accidentally poisoning himself when examining or attempting to neutralize a poison.</p>

					<p>If the investigator&#146;s attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Star watchers study the movements and positions of the sun, the moon, and the stars, searching for secrets written in the sky. They use a combination of scientific study and esoteric arts to measure, record, and predict astronomical cycles and their effects on nature, such as the moon&#146;s influence on tides and rivers. Some star watchers also use these observations to predict fate and significant events, such as natural disasters.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon. Mixing gumption and learnedness into a personal alchemy of daring, investigators are full of surprises. Observing the world around them, they gain valuable knowledge about the situation they&#146;re in, process that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut to the quick of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators are always evaluating situations they encounter, sizing up potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers, all while using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to find solutions to the most perplexing problems.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Investigators live to solve mysteries and find inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as advisors and support for their adventuring parties, but can take center stage when knowledge and cunning are needed. No slouches in battle, they know how to make surprise attacks and use inspiration to bring those attacks home.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Alchemist and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Investigator's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Investigators are proficient with simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, shortbow, short sword, and sword caneUE. They are proficient in light armors, but not shields. A star watcher gains proficiency with the starknife, but not with the rapier.</p>
			<p><b>Alchemy (Su): </b>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
			<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
			<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
			<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
			<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
			<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
			<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>
			<p><b>Astrology (Su): </b>A star watcher studies a symbolic language of the heavens known as astrology. Equal parts art form and science, astrology can be used to read the future and affect it in subtle ways. Much like an alchemist or investigator, a star watcher collects formulae in a formula book. However, the formulae resemble star charts, and unlike alchemists or normal investigators, he uses these formulae along with personal details and astronomical measurements to make horoscopes&#151;magical calculations stored much like scrolls&#151;in which he can store spells. In many ways, the star watcher&#146;s horoscopes function like extracts, with the following exceptions.</p>
			<p>A star watcher&#146;s horoscope is always keyed to a specific creature that must be willing and present when the star watcher prepares the horoscope. Only the creature to which a horoscope is keyed can activate it and be affected by it. A horoscope is &#147;cast&#148; by reading it as a standard action, though a star watcher can draw and read a horoscope as a single standard action.</p>
			<p>A star watcher doesn&#146;t gain a competence bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks to create alchemical items, and he cannot identify potions with that skill. Furthermore, a star watcher cannot select alchemist discoveries as investigator talents. A star watcher can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook or alchemist&#146;s formula book to learn formulae, but a star watcher&#146;s formula book is too esoteric for anyone except another star watcher to learn spells from.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
			<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
			<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Lore (Ex): </b>An investigator has a deep understanding and appreciation for poisons. At 2nd level, he cannot accidentally poison himself when applying poison to a weapon. If the investigator spends 1 minute physically examining the poison, he can attempt a Knowledge (nature) check to identify any natural poison or Knowledge (arcana) check to identify any magical poison (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC). Lastly, once a poison is identified, he can spend 1 minute and attempt a Craft (alchemy) check (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC) to neutralize 1 dose of the poison. Success renders the dose harmless. The investigator has no chance of accidentally poisoning himself when examining or attempting to neutralize a poison.</p>
			<p><b>Starfinding (Ex): </b>A star watcher adds half his level (minimum 1) as a bonus on Knowledge (geography) checks. He can also use astrological methods to read people. By checking his star charts, he can use Knowledge (geography) in place of Sense Motive checks.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Resistance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, an investigator gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against poison. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level, and to +6 at 8th level. At 11th level, the investigator becomes completely immune to poison.</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talent (Ex or Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can only be selected once.</p>
			<p>Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an investigator&#146;s studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p>See the Investigator Talents section for a full list of Talents from all sources.</p>
			<p>A star watcher can select the following talents, in addition to general investigator talents.</p>
			<p><i>Horoscopic Scrolls (Su): </i>The star watcher gains Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat. He can use the feat to create an arcane scroll of any formula he knows. Unlike horoscopes created with the astrology ability, anyone capable of using arcane scrolls can cast a spell from these scrolls. Additionally, the star watcher can use scrolls as if he were an arcane spellcaster. He can use Knowledge (geography) to identify scrolls as if using detect magic. He must hold the scroll for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
			<p><i>Precognition (Su): </i>A star watcher can glimpse into the mysterious possibilities of the future and prepare a horoscope he knows he&#146;ll need later. Once per day as a swift action, a star watcher can treat an open extract slot as though he had prepared a horoscope keyed to himself in it, choosing one formula of the appropriate level from his formula book. A star watcher must be at least 4th level to select this talent.</p>
			<p><i>Returning Star (Ex): </i>Whenever the star watcher uses a starknife as a thrown weapon against a target of his studied combat, the starknife automatically returns as if it had the returning property. The star watcher must have the shooting star investigator talent to select this talent.</p>
			<p><i>Shooting Star (Ex): </i>A star watcher can calculate trajectories with terrifying accuracy. He can apply the benefits of studied combat, studied strike, and investigator talents that add effects to studied combat or studied strike while using a starknife as a thrown weapon.</p>
			<p><b>Keen Recollection: </b>At 3rd level, an investigator can attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Combat (Ex): </b>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Strike (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a free action, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.</p>
			<p>If the investigator&#146;s attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to make an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual &#150;4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.</p>
			<p>The investigator must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. An investigator cannot use studied strike against a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>True Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an investigator can use inspiration on all skill checks&#151;even ones he isn&#146;t trained in&#151;and all ability checks without spending inspiration.</p>
			<p>In addition, whenever he expends inspiration on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can affect this. If using the amazing inspiration investigator talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If using this with empathy, tenacious inspiration, underworld inspiration, or a similar talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the higher of the two results.</p>

					<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>While most investigators look to the physical world to gain their knowledge, there are those who seek out knowledge beyond the pale. Those who think that the dead tell no tales are quickly proven wrong by the spiritualist. Instead of toying with chemicals and reagents to find clues, he talks directly to the spirit world to uncover the ways and means of skullduggery and the desperate acts committed in the heat of dark passions.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon. Mixing gumption and learnedness into a personal alchemy of daring, investigators are full of surprises. Observing the world around them, they gain valuable knowledge about the situation they&#146;re in, process that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut to the quick of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators are always evaluating situations they encounter, sizing up potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers, all while using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to find solutions to the most perplexing problems.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Investigators live to solve mysteries and find inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as advisors and support for their adventuring parties, but can take center stage when knowledge and cunning are needed. No slouches in battle, they know how to make surprise attacks and use inspiration to bring those attacks home.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Alchemist and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Investigator's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Investigators are proficient with simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, short sword, and sword cane. They are proficient in light armors, but not shields.</p>
			<p><b>Commune with Spirits (Sp): </b>Instead of relying on alchemical research to find clues, a spiritualist relies on communion with the world beyond death. At 1st level, a spiritualist gains the ability to use comprehend languages, detect secret doors, and identify, but each has a casting time of 1 minute, as the spiritualist needs to consult with the spirits of the dead that dwell in his area or that are somehow attached to him in some way. The spiritualist can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his investigator level + his Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>As he goes up in level, the spiritualist gains the ability to use other spells with the casting time as above. At 5th level, he can use augury. At 7th level, he can use speak with dead and locate object. At 9th level, he can use legend lore. Each of these requires one use of this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
			<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
			<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>An investigator adds 1/2 his level to Perception skill checks made to locate traps and to Disable Device checks (minimum 1). An investigator can use Disable Device to disarm magical traps.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Sense (Su): </b>At 2nd level, when a spiritualist attempts a saving throw against an ability or an effect delivered by an incorporeal creature, he can expend one use of his inspiration instead of two to augment that saving throw. If the spiritualist has the combat inspiration investigator talent, he need not spend any inspiration to augment such saving throws. This ability replaces poison lore.</p>
			<p><b>Strong Life (Ex): </b>His dealings with the other side and knowledge of what lies beyond strengthens the spiritualist&#146;s will. He gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against death effects and negative energy damage. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level, and to +6 at 8th level. This ability replaces poison resistance.</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talent (Ex or Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can only be selected once.</p>
			<p>Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an investigator&#146;s studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p>See the Investigator Talents section for a full list of Talents from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Keen Recollection: </b>At 3rd level, an investigator can attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Sixth Sense (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a spiritualist can spend one of his uses of the commune with spirits ability to reroll a single saving throw that he has failed. He must take the results of the reroll, even if it is lower. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Combat (Ex): </b>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Strike (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a free action, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.</p>
			<p>If the investigator&#146;s attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to make an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual &#150;4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.</p>
			<p>The investigator must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. An investigator cannot use studied strike against a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Whispering Spirits (Su): </b>At 4th level, the spiritualist can open a conduit with the spirit world that can aid him in combat for a short time. He can expend one use of his commune with spirits ability in order to gain an insight bonus to both AC and saving throws equal to his Wisdom modifier (minimum 1) for 1 minute. This ability replaces swift alchemy.</p>
			<p><b>Touched by the Beyond (Su): </b>At 11th level, the spiritualist&#146;s ability to touch the beyond grants him further protection against the dangers of death and negative energy. The spiritualist becomes immune to death effects, and he takes half damage from negative energy. This ability replaces poison immunity.</p>
			<p><b>True Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an investigator can use inspiration on all skill checks&#151;even ones he isn&#146;t trained in&#151;and all ability checks without spending inspiration.</p>
			<p>In addition, whenever he expends inspiration on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can affect this. If using the amazing inspiration investigator talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If using this with empathy, tenacious inspiration, underworld inspiration, or a similar talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the higher of the two results.</p>

				<name type="string">Sleuth&#146;s Luck</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a sleuth gains a fluctuating pool of luck, measuring her ability to get out of scrapes. At the start of each day, a sleuth has a number of luck points equal to her Charisma modif ier (minimum 1). Her luck goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Charisma modif ier (minimum 1), though feats, magic items, and spells that grant either grit or panache points can also grant a sleuth luck points equal to the amount of grit or panache they grant. A sleuth spends luck to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains luck in the following ways.</p>
					<p>Rolling a Natural 20 on a Knowledge or Sense Motive Check: While on an investigation, a sleuth regains luck by uncovering secrets. Rolling a natural 20 on these skill checks while actively investigating causes the sleuth to regain 1 luck point. Such skill checks made for more mundane reasons (such as normal research or using Sense Motive to gain information during normal bargaining or while gambling) do not regain luck for the sleuth. Determining which skill checks qualify is up to the GM.</p>
					<p>Rolling a 6 or Higher on an Inspiration Roll: When a sleuth rolls an inspiration die while on an investigation and the die comes up a 6 or higher, she regains 1 luck point. (If she rolls multiple inspiration dice at a time, she regains 1 luck point if the total is 6 or higher.) Like regaining luck via a natural 20 on a qualifying skill check, inspiration checks made for more mundane reasons don&#146;t qualify for regaining luck. The GM is the final arbitrator for what rolls qualify. It&#146;s possible for a investigator to regain 2 luck points on the same Skill check, if both the qualifying skill check is a natural 20 and any inspiration roll made is a 6 or higher.</p>
					<p>This and the 1st-level deeds below replace alchemy. A sleuth cannot take the alchemist discovery talent or any investigator talent that affects alchemy.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>An investigator has a deep understanding and appreciation for poisons. At 2nd level, he cannot accidentally poison himself when applying poison to a weapon. If the investigator spends 1 minute physically examining the poison, he can attempt a Knowledge (nature) check to identify any natural poison or Knowledge (arcana) check to identify any magical poison (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC). Lastly, once a poison is identified, he can spend 1 minute and attempt a Craft (alchemy) check (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC) to neutralize 1 dose of the poison. Success renders the dose harmless. The investigator has no chance of accidentally poisoning himself when examining or attempting to neutralize a poison.</p>

At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1 (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
					<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a free action, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A sleuth is an investigator who relies on good fortune and guile rather than alchemy. Having no mystical energy intrinsic to her, she must forgo the more magical aspects of alchemy to solve her mysteries with wits, gumption, and the fickle consideration of luck.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon. Mixing gumption and learnedness into a personal alchemy of daring, investigators are full of surprises. Observing the world around them, they gain valuable knowledge about the situation they&#146;re in, process that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut to the quick of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators are always evaluating situations they encounter, sizing up potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers, all while using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to find solutions to the most perplexing problems.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Investigators live to solve mysteries and find inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as advisors and support for their adventuring parties, but can take center stage when knowledge and cunning are needed. No slouches in battle, they know how to make surprise attacks and use inspiration to bring those attacks home.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Alchemist and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Investigator's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Investigators are proficient with simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, short sword, and sword caneUE. They are proficient in light armors, but not shields.</p>
			<p><b>Deeds: </b>Sleuths spend luck points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant a sleuth some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as a sleuth has at least 1 luck point.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a sleuth gains the following deeds.</p>
			<p><i>Daring (Ex): </i>At 1st level, a sleuth can spend 1 luck point when he makes an Acrobatics, Climb, Escape Artist, Fly, Ride, or Swim check to roll d6 and add the result to the check. He can choose to add this die after he rolls. If the d6 roll is a natural 6, he rolls another d6 and adds it to the check. He can continue to do this as long as he rolls natural 6s, up to a number of times equal to his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1).</p>
			<p><i>Opportunistic Evasion (Ex): </i>At 1st level, when a sleuth succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an effect that still deals damage on a successful save, he can spend 1 luck point as an immediate action to instead take no damage for that effect.</p>
			<p><i>Sleuth&#146;s Initiative (Ex): </i>At 1st level, as long as the sleuth has at least 1 luck point, he gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks. Furthermore, if he has the Quick Draw feat, his hands are free and unrestrained, and the weapon is not hidden, he can draw a single light or one-handed melee weapon as part of the initiative check. (Unlike with swashbuckler deeds, this does not have to be a piercing weapon.)</p>
			<p>At 4th level, a sleuth gains the following deeds. These abilities replace swift alchemy.</p>
			<p><i>Make It Count (Ex): </i>When a sleuth uses studied strike, he can spend 1 luck point to apply an investigator talent that he doesn&#146;t already know and which affects studied strike to his studied strike. He must be able to fulfill that talent&#146;s prerequisites.</p>
			<p><i>Run Like Hell (Ex): </i>At 4th level, a sleuth can spend 1 luck point to gain a +20-foot bonus to his speed for 1 minute. Furthermore, while under the effect of this bonus, if he moves more than his normal speed in a round, he gains a +4 bonus to AC until the start of his next turn.</p>
			<p><i>Second Chance (Ex): </i>At 4th level, when a sleuth rolls an inspiration die or uses daring deed, he can spend 1 luck point to reroll either the inspiration or the daring deed die. If he rolls a 6 or higher on this reroll, he does not regain a luck point, and no matter what he rolls on either roll, he must keep the reroll result, even if it is lower.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
			<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
			<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Sleuth&#146;s Luck (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a sleuth gains a fluctuating pool of luck, measuring her ability to get out of scrapes. At the start of each day, a sleuth has a number of luck points equal to her Charisma modif ier (minimum 1). Her luck goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Charisma modif ier (minimum 1), though feats, magic items, and spells that grant either grit or panache points can also grant a sleuth luck points equal to the amount of grit or panache they grant. A sleuth spends luck to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains luck in the following ways.</p>
			<p><i>Rolling a Natural 20 on a Knowledge or Sense Motive Check: </i>While on an investigation, a sleuth regains luck by uncovering secrets. Rolling a natural 20 on these skill checks while actively investigating causes the sleuth to regain 1 luck point. Such skill checks made for more mundane reasons (such as normal research or using Sense Motive to gain information during normal bargaining or while gambling) do not regain luck for the sleuth. Determining which skill checks qualify is up to the GM.</p>
			<p><i>Rolling a 6 or Higher on an Inspiration Roll: </i>When a sleuth rolls an inspiration die while on an investigation and the die comes up a 6 or higher, she regains 1 luck point. (If she rolls multiple inspiration dice at a time, she regains 1 luck point if the total is 6 or higher.) Like regaining luck via a natural 20 on a qualifying skill check, inspiration checks made for more mundane reasons don&#146;t qualify for regaining luck. The GM is the final arbitrator for what rolls qualify. It&#146;s possible for a investigator to regain 2 luck points on the same Skill check, if both the qualifying skill check is a natural 20 and any inspiration roll made is a 6 or higher.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>An investigator adds 1/2 his level to Perception skill checks made to locate traps and to Disable Device checks (minimum 1). An investigator can use Disable Device to disarm magical traps.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Lore (Ex): </b>An investigator has a deep understanding and appreciation for poisons. At 2nd level, he cannot accidentally poison himself when applying poison to a weapon. If the investigator spends 1 minute physically examining the poison, he can attempt a Knowledge (nature) check to identify any natural poison or Knowledge (arcana) check to identify any magical poison (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC). Lastly, once a poison is identified, he can spend 1 minute and attempt a Craft (alchemy) check (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC) to neutralize 1 dose of the poison. Success renders the dose harmless. The investigator has no chance of accidentally poisoning himself when examining or attempting to neutralize a poison.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Resistance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, an investigator gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against poison. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level, and to +6 at 8th level. At 11th level, the investigator becomes completely immune to poison.</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talent (Ex or Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can only be selected once.</p>
			<p>Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an investigator&#146;s studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p>See the Investigator Talents section for a full list of Talents from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Keen Recollection: </b>At 3rd level, an investigator can attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Trap Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, an investigator gains an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps, granting him a +1 bonus on Ref lex saving throws to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by traps. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1 (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).</p>
			<p><b>Studied Combat (Ex): </b>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Strike (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a free action, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.</p>
			<p>If the investigator&#146;s attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to make an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual &#150;4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.</p>
			<p>The investigator must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. An investigator cannot use studied strike against a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Alchemy (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can create alchemical items with astounding speed. It takes an investigator half the normal amount of time to create alchemical items. He can also apply poison to a weapon as a move action instead of a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>True Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an investigator can use inspiration on all skill checks&#151;even ones he isn&#146;t trained in&#151;and all ability checks without spending inspiration.</p>
			<p>In addition, whenever he expends inspiration on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can affect this. If using the amazing inspiration investigator talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If using this with empathy, tenacious inspiration, underworld inspiration, or a similar talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the higher of the two results.</p>
			<p><b>Grit, Luck, and Panache: </b>Grit, luck, and panache represent three different means by which heroes can gain access to the same heroic pool, using it to accomplish fantastic feats. For characters with a mix of grit, luck, and panache, they pool the three resources together into a combined pool. (Those who use panache and luck do not gain twice their Charisma bonus in their pool.) For feats, magic items, and other effects, a panache user can spend and gain luck points in place of grit or panache points, and vice versa.</p>

				<name type="string">Alchemy</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
					<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
					<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
					<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
					<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
					<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
					<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
					<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>

				<name type="string">Inspiration</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
					<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
					<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a free action, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.</p>
					<p>If the investigator&#146;s attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage.

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Normally, damaging a haunt is a tricky affair requiring the ability to channel positive energy or wield spells capable of doing the same, but the skeptic learns methods of using her own convictions to accomplish the same feat. At 4th level, as a standard action, a skeptic can focus her willpower to damage an active haunt. She must be within a haunt&#146;s area to smite the haunt. When the skeptic uses this ability, she deals an amount of damage to the haunt equal to her studied strike bonus.</p>

					<p>At 20th level, an investigator can use inspiration on all skill checks&#151;even ones he isn&#146;t trained in&#151;and all ability checks without spending inspiration.</p>
					<p>In addition, whenever he expends inspiration on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can affect this. If using the amazing inspiration investigator talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If using this with empathy, tenacious inspiration, underworld inspiration, or a similar talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the higher of the two results.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The skeptic accepts the existence of the occult world while challenging claims that the supernatural explains all of life&#146;s problems. Skeptics tirelessly strive to debunk the legends surrounding possessions and spiritual hauntings, but stand prepared on the off chance a legend turns out to be true. Though these strongwilled investigators master the art of identifying and overcoming haunts and possessions, they often revel in the thrill of revealing a more mundane truth.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon. Mixing gumption and learnedness into a personal alchemy of daring, investigators are full of surprises. Observing the world around them, they gain valuable knowledge about the situation they&#146;re in, process that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut to the quick of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators are always evaluating situations they encounter, sizing up potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers, all while using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to find solutions to the most perplexing problems.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Investigators live to solve mysteries and find inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as advisors and support for their adventuring parties, but can take center stage when knowledge and cunning are needed. No slouches in battle, they know how to make surprise attacks and use inspiration to bring those attacks home.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Alchemist and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Investigator's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Investigators are proficient with simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, short sword, and sword caneUE. They are proficient in light armors, but not shields.</p>
			<p><b>Alchemy (Su): </b>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
			<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
			<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
			<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
			<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
			<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
			<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>
			<p><b>Hauntfinding (Su): </b>At 1st level, a skeptic&#146;s knowledge of haunts allows her to notice them with ease, regardless of the methods by which the haunts make their presence known in the realm of the living. The skeptic adds 1/2 her level to all skill checks to notice haunts. If she notices a haunt, she adds this same bonus to any initiative check made as a result of that haunt activating. This bonus is an insight bonus.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
			<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
			<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Lore (Ex): </b>An investigator has a deep understanding and appreciation for poisons. At 2nd level, he cannot accidentally poison himself when applying poison to a weapon. If the investigator spends 1 minute physically examining the poison, he can attempt a Knowledge (nature) check to identify any natural poison or Knowledge (arcana) check to identify any magical poison (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC). Lastly, once a poison is identified, he can spend 1 minute and attempt a Craft (alchemy) check (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC) to neutralize 1 dose of the poison. Success renders the dose harmless. The investigator has no chance of accidentally poisoning himself when examining or attempting to neutralize a poison.</p>
			<p><b>Suspect Hoax (Ex): </b>Regardless of the actual situation at hand, a skeptic naturally suspects that trickery or hoaxing is at hand. This mindset helps to set the skeptic at ease even when confronted by the most terrifying of situations, be the source of that fear mundane or legitimately supernatural. At 2nd level, a skeptic gains a +1 insight bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities used to falsely create the impression of a supernatural presence, as well as a +1 insight bonus on saving throws caused by the effects of actual haunts or incorporeal undead. This bonus increases to +2 at 5th level, and to +3 at 8th level. At 11th level, a skeptic is immune to fear effects.</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talent (Ex or Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can only be selected once.</p>
			<p>Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an investigator&#146;s studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p>See the Investigator Talents section for a full list of Talents from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Keen Recollection: </b>At 3rd level, an investigator can attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Trap Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, an investigator gains an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps, granting him a +1 bonus on Ref lex saving throws to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by traps. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1 (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).</p>
			<p><b>Studied Combat (Ex): </b>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Strike (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a free action, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.</p>
			<p>If the investigator&#146;s attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to make an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual &#150;4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.</p>
			<p>The investigator must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. An investigator cannot use studied strike against a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Smite Haunt (Su): </b>Normally, damaging a haunt is a tricky affair requiring the ability to channel positive energy or wield spells capable of doing the same, but the skeptic learns methods of using her own convictions to accomplish the same feat. At 4th level, as a standard action, a skeptic can focus her willpower to damage an active haunt. She must be within a haunt&#146;s area to smite the haunt. When the skeptic uses this ability, she deals an amount of damage to the haunt equal to her studied strike bonus.</p>
			<p><b>Exorcising Touch (Su): </b>At 7th level, a skeptic can damage a creature currently possessing another without lethally harming the possessed creature. To make an exorcising strike, the skeptic must make a touch attack against the possessed creature. On a hit, she damages the possessing creature or entity, dealing an amount of lethal damage equal to her studied strike bonus damage. The possessed creature takes this amount of damage as nonlethal damage at the same time.</p>
			<p><b>True Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an investigator can use inspiration on all skill checks&#151;even ones he isn&#146;t trained in&#151;and all ability checks without spending inspiration.</p>
			<p>In addition, whenever he expends inspiration on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can affect this. If using the amazing inspiration investigator talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If using this with empathy, tenacious inspiration, underworld inspiration, or a similar talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the higher of the two results.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
					<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
					<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
					<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
					<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
					<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
					<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
					<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>

				<name type="string">Inspiration</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
					<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
					<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>

Doing so either repairs 1d6 points of damage per extract level of the gadget sacrificed or applies a bonus or penalty to one specific skill check involved in using the device. The scavenger could, for example, sacrifice a gadget to impose a penalty on all Disable Device checks to disarm a trap, add a bonus on all Disable Device checks to open a lock, or add a bonus on all Profession (driver) checks to drive a carriage.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Scavengers are masters of systems: how they fit together, why they work, and how to make the most of their parts. However, scavengers generally lack other investigative talents such as social skills or an understanding of history and lore. The ratfolk of Numeria excel at this art, but nearly every warren across Golarion boasts at least a few resourceful scavengers.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon. Mixing gumption and learnedness into a personal alchemy of daring, investigators are full of surprises. Observing the world around them, they gain valuable knowledge about the situation they&#146;re in, process that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut to the quick of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators are always evaluating situations they encounter, sizing up potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers, all while using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to find solutions to the most perplexing problems.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Investigators live to solve mysteries and find inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as advisors and support for their adventuring parties, but can take center stage when knowledge and cunning are needed. No slouches in battle, they know how to make surprise attacks and use inspiration to bring those attacks home.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Alchemist and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Investigator's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Investigators are proficient with simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, short sword, and sword caneUE. They are proficient in light armors, but not shields.</p>
			<p><b>Alchemy (Su): </b>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
			<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
			<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
			<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
			<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
			<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
			<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>
			<p><b>Gadgetry (Su): </b>A scavenger is a master of mechanical arts rather than alchemical ones, and he gains a competence bonus on Craft (clockwork) checks equal to his class level. He can use Knowledge (engineering) to identify wondrous items as if using detect magic and Spellcraft. A scavenger does not gain any bonuses to or special uses of the Craft (alchemy) skill.</p>
			<p>Rather than prepare his extracts as consumable liquids, a scavenger constructs small, single-use devices infused with bits of his own magic aura to achieve the same effects. Alchemist and investigator discoveries that affect extracts result in identical effects on a scavenger&#146;s gadgets (such as the infusion discovery, which would allow another creature to use a gadget, just as it would allow that creature to use an extract).</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
			<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
			<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Mechanical Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a scavenger can use inspiration to apply a bonus to Appraise, Disable Device, and Knowledge (engineering) checks without expending a use of inspiration, but he must spend a use of inspiration to apply a bonus on Knowledge, Linguistics, and Spellcraft checks.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>An investigator adds 1/2 his level to Perception skill checks made to locate traps and to Disable Device checks (minimum 1). An investigator can use Disable Device to disarm magical traps.</p>
			<p><b>Construct Mastery (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a scavenger gains a +2 bonus on all Craft checks to modify or repair creatures of the construct type, as well as a +2 bonus on all weapon damage rolls against constructs. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level, and to +6 at 8th level. At 11th level, the scavenger gains Craft Construct as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites.</p>
			<p><b>Jury-Rig (Ex): </b>Beginning at 2nd level, a scavenger can sacrifice one of his gadgets to repair or enhance an adjacent mechanical device, such as a lock, trap, or vehicle. Doing so either repairs 1d6 points of damage per extract level of the gadget sacrificed or applies a bonus or penalty to one specific skill check involved in using the device. The scavenger could, for example, sacrifice a gadget to impose a penalty on all Disable Device checks to disarm a trap, add a bonus on all Disable Device checks to open a lock, or add a bonus on all Profession (driver) checks to drive a carriage. This modifier is equal to twice the extract level of the gadget sacrificed, and lasts for 10 minutes per class level.</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talent (Ex or Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can only be selected once.</p>
			<p>Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an investigator&#146;s studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p>See the Investigator Talents section for a full list of Talents from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Keen Recollection: </b>At 3rd level, an investigator can attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Trap Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, an investigator gains an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps, granting him a +1 bonus on Ref lex saving throws to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by traps. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1 (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).</p>
			<p><b>Studied Combat (Ex): </b>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Strike (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a free action, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.</p>
			<p>If the investigator&#146;s attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to make an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual &#150;4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.</p>
			<p>The investigator must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. An investigator cannot use studied strike against a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Alchemy (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can create alchemical items with astounding speed. It takes an investigator half the normal amount of time to create alchemical items. He can also apply poison to a weapon as a move action instead of a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>True Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an investigator can use inspiration on all skill checks&#151;even ones he isn&#146;t trained in&#151;and all ability checks without spending inspiration.</p>
			<p>In addition, whenever he expends inspiration on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can affect this. If using the amazing inspiration investigator talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If using this with empathy, tenacious inspiration, underworld inspiration, or a similar talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the higher of the two results.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
					<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
					<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
					<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
					<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
					<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
					<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
					<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>

				<name type="string">Inspiration</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A ruthless agent focuses on reading motivations and using interrogation tactics. She can use inspiration on Intimidate, Knowledge, and Sense Motive checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided she&#146;s trained in the skill. A ruthless agent can&#146;t spend inspiration on attack rolls or saving throws.</p>
					<p>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
					<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
					<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>

				<name type="string">Enhanced Intimidation</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A ruthless agent adds half her investigator level (minimum +1) as a bonus on Intimidate checks. When the ruthless agent uses Intimidate to influence an opponent&#146;s attitude, the duration of the attitude shift is 1d6&#215;10 minutes per investigator level (rather than the normal 1d6&#215;10 minutes).</p>
					<p>Additionally, the ruthless agent is an expert in blending coercion and fear. The first time the ruthless agent attempts to use Intimidate to influence an opponent&#146;s attitude and fails, she can retry it against that same opponent with no increase to the DC. Subsequent attempts to influence the same opponent are subject to increased DCs as normal.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>An investigator has a deep understanding and appreciation for poisons. At 2nd level, he cannot accidentally poison himself when applying poison to a weapon. If the investigator spends 1 minute physically examining the poison, he can attempt a Knowledge (nature) check to identify any natural poison or Knowledge (arcana) check to identify any magical poison (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC). Lastly, once a poison is identified, he can spend 1 minute and attempt a Craft (alchemy) check (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC) to neutralize 1 dose of the poison. Success renders the dose harmless. The investigator has no chance of accidentally poisoning himself when examining or attempting to neutralize a poison.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Ruthless agents are often called upon for their skills at extracting information by any means necessary. Though some view their methods as extreme, ruthless agents prize getting the job done at all costs. Ruthless agents can be found in the employ of nearly any organization&#151;even goodly groups whose leaders either don&#146;t know the extent of ruthless agents&#146; zeal or are willing to look the other way to take advantage of these investigators&#146; incredible efficiency.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon. Mixing gumption and learnedness into a personal alchemy of daring, investigators are full of surprises. Observing the world around them, they gain valuable knowledge about the situation they&#146;re in, process that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut to the quick of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators are always evaluating situations they encounter, sizing up potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers, all while using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to find solutions to the most perplexing problems.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Investigators live to solve mysteries and find inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as advisors and support for their adventuring parties, but can take center stage when knowledge and cunning are needed. No slouches in battle, they know how to make surprise attacks and use inspiration to bring those attacks home.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any nongood.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Alchemist and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Investigator's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Investigators are proficient with simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, short sword, and sword caneUE. They are proficient in light armors, but not shields.</p>
			<p><b>Alchemy (Su): </b>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
			<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
			<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
			<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
			<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
			<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
			<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>
			<p><b>Enhanced Intimidation (Ex): </b>A ruthless agent adds half her investigator level (minimum +1) as a bonus on Intimidate checks. When the ruthless agent uses Intimidate to influence an opponent&#146;s attitude, the duration of the attitude shift is 1d6&#215;10 minutes per investigator level (rather than the normal 1d6&#215;10 minutes).</p>
			<p>Additionally, the ruthless agent is an expert in blending coercion and fear. The first time the ruthless agent attempts to use Intimidate to influence an opponent&#146;s attitude and fails, she can retry it against that same opponent with no increase to the DC. Subsequent attempts to influence the same opponent are subject to increased DCs as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>A ruthless agent focuses on reading motivations and using interrogation tactics. She can use inspiration on Intimidate, Knowledge, and Sense Motive checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided she&#146;s trained in the skill. A ruthless agent can&#146;t spend inspiration on attack rolls or saving throws.</p>
			<p>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
			<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
			<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Lore (Ex): </b>An investigator has a deep understanding and appreciation for poisons. At 2nd level, he cannot accidentally poison himself when applying poison to a weapon. If the investigator spends 1 minute physically examining the poison, he can attempt a Knowledge (nature) check to identify any natural poison or Knowledge (arcana) check to identify any magical poison (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC). Lastly, once a poison is identified, he can spend 1 minute and attempt a Craft (alchemy) check (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC) to neutralize 1 dose of the poison. Success renders the dose harmless. The investigator has no chance of accidentally poisoning himself when examining or attempting to neutralize a poison.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Resistance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, an investigator gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against poison. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level, and to +6 at 8th level. At 11th level, the investigator becomes completely immune to poison.</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talent (Ex or Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can only be selected once.</p>
			<p>Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an investigator&#146;s studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p>See the Investigator Talents section for a full list of Talents from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Keen Recollection: </b>At 3rd level, an investigator can attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Interrogate (Su): </b>At 3rd level as a full-round action, a ruthless agent can ask a target one question for every 2 investigator levels she has. The target is not compelled to answer truthfully, but the ruthless agent&#146;s implicit or explicit threats and looming manner leads the target to believe the ruthless agent will cause it serious harm if it lies. This imposes a &#150;2 penalty on the target&#146;s Bluff checks to lie when answering the specific questions the ruthless agent asked. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the penalty increases by 2 (to a maximum of &#150;12 at 18th level). She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Intelligence modifier. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Combat (Ex): </b>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Strike (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a free action, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.</p>
			<p>If the investigator&#146;s attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to make an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual &#150;4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.</p>
			<p>The investigator must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. An investigator cannot use studied strike against a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Agonizing Strike (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a ruthless agent has learned how to finesse her attacks to discomfort a foe. When she deals damage using her studied strike, she can make this damage nonlethal (regardless of whether her weapon normally deals lethal or nonlethal damage), forcing the target to succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half the ruthless agent&#146;s level + her Intelligence modifier) or be sickened for 1 round and take a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws for 1 minute. Multiple agonizing strikes do not worsen the condition or impose an additional penalty on Will saves, but they do increase the duration of both effects.</p>
			<p><b>Concoction of Truth (Su): </b>At 7th level, a ruthless agent automatically adds discern lies to her list of formulae known. She prepares this as a 3rd-level extract, and she can prepare one discern lies extract each day that does not count against her daily allotment of extracts</p>
			<p><b>Compel Obedience (Sp): </b>At 11th level, a ruthless agent can issue a binding command to a creature as a full-round action once per day. This command acts like geas/quest with the creature as the target, using the ruthless agent&#146;s investigator level as the caster level. The ruthless agent can compel obedience from only one creature at a time (as soon as the geas/quest is fulfilled, however, the ruthless agent can use this ability again, as long as she has a use of this ability available).</p>
			<p>At 17th level, the ruthless agent can compel obedience from two creatures at once, and she is always aware of the targets as if they were under the effects of a status spell (caster level = the ruthless agent&#146;s investigator level).</p>
			<p><b>True Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an investigator can use inspiration on all skill checks&#151;even ones he isn&#146;t trained in&#151;and all ability checks without spending inspiration.</p>
			<p>In addition, whenever he expends inspiration on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can affect this. If using the amazing inspiration investigator talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If using this with empathy, tenacious inspiration, underworld inspiration, or a similar talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the higher of the two results.</p>

An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
					<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
					<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
					<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>

				<name type="string">Inspiration</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
					<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
					<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>

Lastly, once a poison is identified, he can spend 1 minute and attempt a Craft (alchemy) check (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC) to neutralize 1 dose of the poison.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Reckless epicureans are investigators who, for whatever reason, tend to test unknown concoctions on themselves. Whether an obsessive scientist, a healer determined to ensure the safety of her tinctures, or a seeker of new and interesting potions, a reckless epicurean&#146;s body is saturated with experimental chemicals and magic. She can prepare extracts without formulae by approximating the taste, and she can guzzle cursed concoctions without batting an eyelash.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon. Mixing gumption and learnedness into a personal alchemy of daring, investigators are full of surprises. Observing the world around them, they gain valuable knowledge about the situation they&#146;re in, process that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut to the quick of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators are always evaluating situations they encounter, sizing up potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers, all while using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to find solutions to the most perplexing problems.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Investigators live to solve mysteries and find inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as advisors and support for their adventuring parties, but can take center stage when knowledge and cunning are needed. No slouches in battle, they know how to make surprise attacks and use inspiration to bring those attacks home.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Alchemist and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Investigator's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Investigators are proficient with simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, short sword, and sword caneUE. They are proficient in light armors, but not shields.</p>
			<p><b>Alchemy (Su): </b>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
			<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
			<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
			<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
			<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
			<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
			<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
			<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
			<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>An investigator adds 1/2 his level to Perception skill checks made to locate traps and to Disable Device checks (minimum 1). An investigator can use Disable Device to disarm magical traps.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Lore (Ex): </b>An investigator has a deep understanding and appreciation for poisons. At 2nd level, he cannot accidentally poison himself when applying poison to a weapon. If the investigator spends 1 minute physically examining the poison, he can attempt a Knowledge (nature) check to identify any natural poison or Knowledge (arcana) check to identify any magical poison (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC). Lastly, once a poison is identified, he can spend 1 minute and attempt a Craft (alchemy) check (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC) to neutralize 1 dose of the poison. Success renders the dose harmless. The investigator has no chance of accidentally poisoning himself when examining or attempting to neutralize a poison.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Resistance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, an investigator gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against poison. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level, and to +6 at 8th level. At 11th level, the investigator becomes completely immune to poison.</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talent (Ex or Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can only be selected once.</p>
			<p>Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an investigator&#146;s studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p>See the Investigator Talents section for a full list of Talents from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Keen Recollection: </b>At 3rd level, an investigator can attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Trap Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, an investigator gains an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps, granting him a +1 bonus on Ref lex saving throws to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by traps. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1 (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).</p>
			<p><b>Studied Combat (Ex): </b>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Strike (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a free action, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.</p>
			<p>If the investigator&#146;s attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to make an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual &#150;4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.</p>
			<p>The investigator must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. An investigator cannot use studied strike against a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Alchemy (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can create alchemical items with astounding speed. It takes an investigator half the normal amount of time to create alchemical items. He can also apply poison to a weapon as a move action instead of a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>Experimental Potable (Su): </b>At 5th level, once per day, a reckless epicurean can prepare one experimental potable using a formula that she does not know from the alchemist formulae list into an extract slot of the appropriate level. These experimental potables often have side effects. When a creature consumes one of these potables, the investigator must succeed at a Spellcraft check (DC = 15 + the formula&#146;s level). On a failure, she must roll on the Wild Magic Surge table (Pathfinder RPG Pathfinder Unchained 147) to determine the extra effects. If the wild magic surge effect isn&#146;t possible due to the nature of the spell or effect, roll instead on the Universal Surge Effects table (Pathfinder Unchained 148). Results concerning the caster affect the drinker of the experimental potable instead.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, and every 3 levels thereafter, the reckless epicurean can prepare one additional experimental potable per day.</p>
			<p><b>Sympathetic Resistance (Su): </b>At 13th level, when a reckless epicurean drinks an extract or a potion, she gains an alchemical bonus on saves against spells and spell-like abilities of the same school as that potion or extract for a number of rounds equal to her Intelligence modifier. This bonus is equal to the level of the spell contained in the extract or potion. The investigator can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Intelligence modifier (minimum 1).</p>
			<p><b>True Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an investigator can use inspiration on all skill checks&#151;even ones he isn&#146;t trained in&#151;and all ability checks without spending inspiration.</p>
			<p>In addition, whenever he expends inspiration on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can affect this. If using the amazing inspiration investigator talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If using this with empathy, tenacious inspiration, underworld inspiration, or a similar talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the higher of the two results.</p>

He knows the same number of spells and receives the same number of spell slots per day as a bard of his investigator level, including for cantrips. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Intelligence score.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 investigator levels thereafter, a questioner can learn a new spell in place of one he already knows, using the same rules as a bard. In effect, the questioner loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell the questioner can cast.</p>
					<p>A questioner need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any bard spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>

				<name type="string">Inspiration</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
					<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
					<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Dabblers in arcane magic and masters of stealth and guile, questioners are investigators who often find themselves mucking about in cases for less-than-savory clientele or that require an extra bit of subtlety. Although questioners are found in nearly every major city in the Inner Sea region, Ustalav has the highest concentration; many belong to the famed Sleepless Detectives, while others have trained to evade the notice of that acclaimed agency</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon. Mixing gumption and learnedness into a personal alchemy of daring, investigators are full of surprises. Observing the world around them, they gain valuable knowledge about the situation they&#146;re in, process that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut to the quick of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators are always evaluating situations they encounter, sizing up potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers, all while using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to find solutions to the most perplexing problems.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Investigators live to solve mysteries and find inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as advisors and support for their adventuring parties, but can take center stage when knowledge and cunning are needed. No slouches in battle, they know how to make surprise attacks and use inspiration to bring those attacks home.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Alchemist and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Investigator's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Investigators are proficient with simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, short sword, and sword caneUE. They are proficient in light armors, but not shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A questioner casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a questioner must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a questioner&#146;s spell is equal to 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the questioner&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a questioner can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. He knows the same number of spells and receives the same number of spell slots per day as a bard of his investigator level, including for cantrips. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Intelligence score.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 investigator levels thereafter, a questioner can learn a new spell in place of one he already knows, using the same rules as a bard. In effect, the questioner loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell the questioner can cast.</p>
			<p>A questioner need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any bard spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
			<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
			<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration for Subterfuge (Ex): </b>A questioner can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Stealth checks he attempts without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in that skill.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>An investigator adds 1/2 his level to Perception skill checks made to locate traps and to Disable Device checks (minimum 1). An investigator can use Disable Device to disarm magical traps.</p>
			<p><b>Know-It-All (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a questioner receives a +1 bonus on skill checks for all Knowledge skills in which he is trained. This bonus increases by 1 at 5th level and every 3 investigator levels thereafter, to a maximum of +6 at 17th level. If he has the perceptive trackingACG investigator talent, he also adds this bonus on Perception checks to find and follow tracks. At 5th level, the questioner gains the eidetic recollectionACG investigator talent as a bonus talent, ignoring its prerequisites. This ability replaces poison lore.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Resistance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, an investigator gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against poison. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level, and to +6 at 8th level. At 11th level, the investigator becomes completely immune to poison.</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talent (Ex or Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can only be selected once.</p>
			<p>Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an investigator&#146;s studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p>See the Investigator Talents section for a full list of Talents from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Restricted Talents: </b>A questioner selects investigator talents as normal, except he cannot select the alchemist discovery investigator talent.</p>
			<p><b>Keen Recollection: </b>At 3rd level, an investigator can attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Trap Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, an investigator gains an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps, granting him a +1 bonus on Ref lex saving throws to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by traps. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1 (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).</p>
			<p><b>Studied Combat (Ex): </b>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Strike (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a free action, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.</p>
			<p>If the investigator&#146;s attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to make an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual &#150;4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.</p>
			<p>The investigator must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. An investigator cannot use studied strike against a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Alchemy (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can create alchemical items with astounding speed. It takes an investigator half the normal amount of time to create alchemical items. He can also apply poison to a weapon as a move action instead of a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>True Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an investigator can use inspiration on all skill checks&#151;even ones he isn&#146;t trained in&#151;and all ability checks without spending inspiration.</p>
			<p>In addition, whenever he expends inspiration on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can affect this. If using the amazing inspiration investigator talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If using this with empathy, tenacious inspiration, underworld inspiration, or a similar talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the higher of the two results.</p>

					<p>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
					<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A psychic detective supplements her keen insight with occult skill to unravel mysteries both ordinary and supernatural.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon. Mixing gumption and learnedness into a personal alchemy of daring, investigators are full of surprises. Observing the world around them, they gain valuable knowledge about the situation they&#146;re in, process that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut to the quick of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators are always evaluating situations they encounter, sizing up potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers, all while using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to find solutions to the most perplexing problems.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Investigators live to solve mysteries and find inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as advisors and support for their adventuring parties, but can take center stage when knowledge and cunning are needed. No slouches in battle, they know how to make surprise attacks and use inspiration to bring those attacks home.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Alchemist and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Investigator's class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Investigators are proficient with simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, short sword, and sword caneE. They are proficient in light armors, but not shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A psychic detective casts psychic spells drawn from the psychic class spell list (see page 69) and augmented by a select set of additional spells (see Psychic Detective Spells on page 120). Only spells from the psychic class spell list of 6th level or lower and psychic detective spells are considered to be part of the psychic detective&#146;s spell list. If a spell appears on both the psychic detective and psychic class spell lists, the psychic detective uses the spell level from the psychic detective spell list. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a psychic detective must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a psychic detective&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the psychic detective&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a psychic detective can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. She knows the same number of spells and receives the same number of spells slots per day as a bard of her investigator level, and knows and uses 0-level knacks as a bard uses cantrips. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a psychic detective can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows, using the same rules as a bard. In effect, the psychic detective loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell the psychic detective can cast.</p>
			<p>A psychic detective need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any psychic detective spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p>Psychic Detective Spells: A psychic detective has the following spells on her spell list, in addition to psychic spells of 6th level or lower.</p>
			<p>1st&#151;Detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, find traps.</p>
			<p>3rd&#151;Calm spirit, daylight.</p>
			<p>4th&#151;Modify memory.</p>
			<p>6th&#151;Banishment, moment of prescience, scrying (greater).</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
			<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
			<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>An investigator adds 1/2 his level to Perception skill checks made to locate traps and to Disable Device checks (minimum 1). An investigator can use Disable Device to disarm magical traps.</p>
			<p><b>Psychic Meddler (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a psychic detective receives a +1 bonus on saves against psychic spells and spell-like abilities. This bonus increases by 1 at 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, to a maximum of +6 at 17th level. Starting at 5th level, the psychic investigator adds half this bonus on caster level checks to dispel psychic effects. This ability replaces poison lore, poison resistance, swift alchemy, and poison immunity.</p>
			<p><b>Keen Recollection: </b>At 3rd level, an investigator can attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Phrenic Dabbler (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a psychic detective gains a small pool of phrenic points equal to 1/2 her psychic detective level, as well as one phrenic amplification, as the psychic class feature. This does not allow the psychic detective to qualify for the Extra Amplification feat. This ability replaces the investigator talent gained at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Trap Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, an investigator gains an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps, granting him a +1 bonus on Ref lex saving throws to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by traps. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1 (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).</p>
			<p><b>Studied Combat (Ex): </b>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Strike (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a free action, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.</p>
			<p>If the investigator&#146;s attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to make an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual &#150;4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.</p>
			<p>The investigator must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. An investigator cannot use studied strike against a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talent (Ex or Su): </b>At 5th level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can only be selected once.Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an investigator&#146;s studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p>See the Investigator Talents section for a full list of Talents from all sources.</p>
			<p>A psychic detective selects investigator talents as normal, except she cannot select the alchemist discovery investigator talent. She can select the Expanded Phrenic Pool feat as a discovery even though she doesn&#146;t meet that feat&#146;s prerequisites, and she can select an extra phrenic amplification once as a discovery. The following investigator talents, which can be found on pages 32&#150;34 of the Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide, complement the psychic detective archetype: confusing strike, device talent, effortless aid, hidden agendas, inspired intelligence, item lore, and unconventional inspiration. This ability alters investigator talents.</p>
			<p><b>True Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an investigator can use inspiration on all skill checks&#151;even ones he isn&#146;t trained in&#151;and all ability checks without spending inspiration.</p>
			<p>In addition, whenever he expends inspiration on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can affect this. If using the amazing inspiration investigator talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If using this with empathy, tenacious inspiration, underworld inspiration, or a similar talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the higher of the two results.</p>

				<name type="string">Alchemy</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
					<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
					<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
					<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
					<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
					<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
					<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
					<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>

				<name type="string">Expert Profiler</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A profiler gains a bonus equal to 1/2 his class level (minimum +1) on Sense Motive checks. At 2nd level, he can use inspiration on any Sense Motive check without expending a use of inspiration, provided he is trained in the skill.</p>
					<p>At 3rd level, he can attempt to predict a creature&#146;s movements using his knowledge of the creature&#146;s psychology. He can use this ability only on a creature familiar to him (for example, a serial killer whose crimes the profiler has studied will suffice, even if the profiler hasn&#146;t yet identified the serial killer&#146;s true identity). To do so, he starts from a place where he knows that the creature has been and why (most often the scene of a crime) and attempts a Sense Motive check against a DC equal to 40 or to 20 + the creature&#146;s Bluff modifier, whichever is higher, which the GM rolls in secret. On a failure, the profiler&#146;s guess about the creatures movements is inaccurate. On a success, the profiler is able to track the creature&#146;s general movements as if using Survival to track (though the usual modifiers on Survival checks to track don&#146;t apply, and this ability allows her to track a creature using pass without trace or otherwise leaving no trail). After at most 1 hour (or sooner if there are many possible options for the creature to take, at the GM&#146;s discretion), if the profiler has not yet found further evidence of the creature&#146;s passing (such as footprints, fingerprints, or any other indication that the creature came this way), he loses track of the creature&#146;s movements; if he does, he can try to guess where the creature went next by attempting another check.</p>

At 11th level, a profiler can expend one use of inspiration to add 1d6 to the result of a concentration check when using a divination extract or investigator spell-like ability.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Profilers understand the human psyche to an intense degree, allowing them to predict the criminals they hunt.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon. Mixing gumption and learnedness into a personal alchemy of daring, investigators are full of surprises. Observing the world around them, they gain valuable knowledge about the situation they&#146;re in, process that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut to the quick of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators are always evaluating situations they encounter, sizing up potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers, all while using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to find solutions to the most perplexing problems.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Investigators live to solve mysteries and find inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as advisors and support for their adventuring parties, but can take center stage when knowledge and cunning are needed. No slouches in battle, they know how to make surprise attacks and use inspiration to bring those attacks home.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Alchemist and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Investigator's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Investigators are proficient with simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, short sword, and sword caneUE. They are proficient in light armors, but not shields.</p>
			<p><b>Alchemy (Su): </b>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
			<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
			<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
			<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
			<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
			<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
			<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>
			<p><b>Expert Profiler (Ex): </b>A profiler gains a bonus equal to 1/2 his class level (minimum +1) on Sense Motive checks. At 2nd level, he can use inspiration on any Sense Motive check without expending a use of inspiration, provided he is trained in the skill.</p>
			<p>At 3rd level, he can attempt to predict a creature&#146;s movements using his knowledge of the creature&#146;s psychology. He can use this ability only on a creature familiar to him (for example, a serial killer whose crimes the profiler has studied will suffice, even if the profiler hasn&#146;t yet identified the serial killer&#146;s true identity). To do so, he starts from a place where he knows that the creature has been and why (most often the scene of a crime) and attempts a Sense Motive check against a DC equal to 40 or to 20 + the creature&#146;s Bluff modifier, whichever is higher, which the GM rolls in secret. On a failure, the profiler&#146;s guess about the creatures movements is inaccurate. On a success, the profiler is able to track the creature&#146;s general movements as if using Survival to track (though the usual modifiers on Survival checks to track don&#146;t apply, and this ability allows her to track a creature using pass without trace or otherwise leaving no trail). After at most 1 hour (or sooner if there are many possible options for the creature to take, at the GM&#146;s discretion), if the profiler has not yet found further evidence of the creature&#146;s passing (such as footprints, fingerprints, or any other indication that the creature came this way), he loses track of the creature&#146;s movements; if he does, he can try to guess where the creature went next by attempting another check.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
			<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
			<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Divination Analysis (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a profiler has analyzed the workings of the mind. His caster level to determine the duration of his divination extracts increases by 1, and he gains a +1 bonus on saving throws against divinations. The increases to caster level and bonus on saving throws increase by 1 at 5th level and by another 1 at 8th level. At 11th level, a profiler can expend one use of inspiration to add 1d6 to the result of a concentration check when using a divination extract or investigator spell-like ability.</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talent (Ex or Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can only be selected once.</p>
			<p>Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an investigator&#146;s studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p>See the Investigator Talents section for a full list of Talents from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Keen Recollection: </b>At 3rd level, an investigator can attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Trap Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, an investigator gains an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps, granting him a +1 bonus on Ref lex saving throws to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by traps. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1 (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).</p>
			<p><b>Studied Combat (Ex): </b>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Strike (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a free action, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.</p>
			<p>If the investigator&#146;s attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to make an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual &#150;4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.</p>
			<p>The investigator must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. An investigator cannot use studied strike against a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Blood Sleuth (Sp): </b>At 4th level, a profiler can expend one use of his inspiration to use discern next of kinACG as a spell-like ability. Alternatively, he can expend two uses of inspiration to use blood biographyAPG as a spell-like ability.</p>
			<p><b>Pack Psychology (Su): </b>At 7th level, a profiler can understand the way that groups act together, allowing him to exploit the vulnerabilities in their attacks. A profiler can&#146;t be flanked by creatures with an Intelligence score and he gains a +1 bonus to his AC against such creatures when they would otherwise flank him, as he plays their movements against each other.</p>
			<p><b>True Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an investigator can use inspiration on all skill checks&#151;even ones he isn&#146;t trained in&#151;and all ability checks without spending inspiration.</p>
			<p>In addition, whenever he expends inspiration on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can affect this. If using the amazing inspiration investigator talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If using this with empathy, tenacious inspiration, underworld inspiration, or a similar talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the higher of the two results.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
					<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
					<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
					<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
					<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
					<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
					<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
					<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
					<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
					<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>While most investigators seek answers to mundane mysteries, portal seekers chase more unusual enigmas: portals to other planes. While in many cases, portal seekers are boons to their communities, performing public services such as discovering planar rifts and, as needed, closing unwanted ones, a portal seeker&#146;s goals are not necessarily benign.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon. Mixing gumption and learnedness into a personal alchemy of daring, investigators are full of surprises. Observing the world around them, they gain valuable knowledge about the situation they&#146;re in, process that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut to the quick of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators are always evaluating situations they encounter, sizing up potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers, all while using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to find solutions to the most perplexing problems.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Investigators live to solve mysteries and find inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as advisors and support for their adventuring parties, but can take center stage when knowledge and cunning are needed. No slouches in battle, they know how to make surprise attacks and use inspiration to bring those attacks home.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Alchemist and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Investigator's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Investigators are proficient with simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, short sword, and sword caneUE. They are proficient in light armors, but not shields.</p>
			<p><b>Alchemy (Su): </b>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
			<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
			<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
			<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
			<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
			<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
			<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>
			<p><b>Hunt Portal (Sp): </b>A portal seeker can try to locate an unseen magical portal within 60 feet by concentrating and attempting a DC 20 Knowledge (planes) check. If successful, the portal seeker becomes aware of the presence of all extradimensional portals (including those created by spells like rope trick or by magic items like bags of holding) in a 60-foot radius. If she concentrates for 3 rounds, she can pinpoint the locations of all portals in the area of effect. Some portals, at the GM&#146;s discretion, may be magically hidden and have a higher DC to detect.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
			<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
			<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Portal Lore (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, when a portal seeker detects a portal, she can attempt a Knowledge (planes) check (DC = 15 + the portal&#146;s caster level, or DC 25 if the caster level isn&#146;t specified) to determine the portal&#146;s destination plane. If her result exceeds the DC by 5 or more, she also determines the rough location on the destination plane where the portal leads, and if the result exceeds the DC by 10 or more, she also determines any command words, portal keys, and other necessary elements needed to open the portal.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Teleportation (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a portal seeker gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against effects that attempt to magically transport her via a teleportation effect. This bonus increases by 1 at 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, to a maximum bonus of +8 at 20th level. The portal seeker also applies this bonus to saving throws against imprisonment, and she never takes a penalty on her save against this spell as a result of the caster knowing her name and facts about her life.</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talent (Ex or Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can only be selected once.</p>
			<p>Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an investigator&#146;s studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p>See the Investigator Talents section for a full list of Talents from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Keen Recollection: </b>At 3rd level, an investigator can attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Trap Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, an investigator gains an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps, granting him a +1 bonus on Ref lex saving throws to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by traps. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1 (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).</p>
			<p><b>Studied Combat (Ex): </b>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Transit Portals (Su): </b>At 4th level, a portal seeker can create ephemeral portals to improve her maneuverability. At the start of each day, she gains a number of Portal Points equal to her investigator level. She can spend 1 Portal Point as a swift action during a move or withdraw action to open and step through a momentary portal to a location within 20 feet that she can see. Stepping through the portal takes 5 feet of movement, and while the rest of her movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal, the extra movement from the portal is a teleportation effect that doesn&#146;t provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
			<p>The distance she can travel increases by 10 feet at 6th level and every 2 levels thereafter, to a maximum distance of 100 feet at 20th level.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Alchemy (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can create alchemical items with astounding speed. It takes an investigator half the normal amount of time to create alchemical items. He can also apply poison to a weapon as a move action instead of a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>Extended Portals (Su): </b>At 11th level, a portal seeker can spend 2 Portal Points to create two portals as a standard action, one in an adjacent square and one within 5 feet per investigator level she has in a visible location. These portals persist until the end of her next turn, and creatures of any size can step move through either, using 5 feet of movement to exit from the other portal. At the end of her next turn, she can spend an additional 2 Portal Points as a free action to extend the portals&#146; duration by 1 round.</p>
			<p><b>True Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an investigator can use inspiration on all skill checks&#151;even ones he isn&#146;t trained in&#151;and all ability checks without spending inspiration.</p>
			<p>In addition, whenever he expends inspiration on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can affect this. If using the amazing inspiration investigator talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If using this with empathy, tenacious inspiration, underworld inspiration, or a similar talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the higher of the two results.</p>

To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
					<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>

					<p>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
					<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
					<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>

If the investigator spends 1 minute physically examining the poison, he can attempt a Knowledge (nature) check to identify any natural poison or Knowledge (arcana) check to identify any magical poison (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC). Lastly, once a poison is identified, he can spend 1 minute and attempt a Craft (alchemy) check (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC) to neutralize 1 dose of the poison. Success renders the dose harmless. The investigator has no chance of accidentally poisoning himself when examining or attempting to neutralize a poison.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Natural philosophers are scholars, explorers, and survivalists who feel at home in nature, seldom longing for the comforts of the city. They eschew the fancy tools and weaponry of gentlefolk detectives and instead employ weapons that double as tools, materials available in nature, and methods better suited for untamed wilderness.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon. Mixing gumption and learnedness into a personal alchemy of daring, investigators are full of surprises. Observing the world around them, they gain valuable knowledge about the situation they&#146;re in, process that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut to the quick of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators are always evaluating situations they encounter, sizing up potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers, all while using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to find solutions to the most perplexing problems.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Investigators live to solve mysteries and find inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as advisors and support for their adventuring parties, but can take center stage when knowledge and cunning are needed. No slouches in battle, they know how to make surprise attacks and use inspiration to bring those attacks home.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Alchemist and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Investigator's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Survival (Wis), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A natural philosopher is proficient with simple weapons, plus the handaxe, kukri, shortbow, throwing axe, and whip. A natural philosopher is proficient with light armor but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Alchemy (Su): </b>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
			<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
			<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
			<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
			<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
			<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
			<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
			<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
			<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Natural Philosopher&#146;s Inspiration (Ex): </b>Natural philosophers employ a skill set suited to studying the natural world. A natural philosopher can use inspiration on Heal and Survival checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he is trained in the skill, but cannot do so for Linguistics or Spellcraft checks. He can later trade an investigator talent for the ability to use inspiration on Linguistics and Spellcraft checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he is trained in the skill.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A natural philosopher adds half his level (minimum 1) on Survival checks to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Lore (Ex): </b>An investigator has a deep understanding and appreciation for poisons. At 2nd level, he cannot accidentally poison himself when applying poison to a weapon. If the investigator spends 1 minute physically examining the poison, he can attempt a Knowledge (nature) check to identify any natural poison or Knowledge (arcana) check to identify any magical poison (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC). Lastly, once a poison is identified, he can spend 1 minute and attempt a Craft (alchemy) check (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC) to neutralize 1 dose of the poison. Success renders the dose harmless. The investigator has no chance of accidentally poisoning himself when examining or attempting to neutralize a poison.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Resistance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, an investigator gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against poison. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level, and to +6 at 8th level. At 11th level, the investigator becomes completely immune to poison.</p>
			<p><b>Herbalism (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a natural philosopher augments his knowledge of alchemy with herbal lore. He gains the infusion discovery and can use Knowledge (nature) in place of Craft (alchemy) and Profession (herbalist) checks. He also gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on Craft (alchemy) checks to create alchemical items, and he gains half that bonus on Profession (herbalist) checks to find herbs (for more information on herbalism, see page 152).</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talent (Ex or Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can only be selected once.</p>
			<p>Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an investigator&#146;s studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p>See the Investigator Talents section for a full list of Talents from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Keen Recollection: </b>At 3rd level, an investigator can attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Combat (Ex): </b>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Strike (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a free action, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.</p>
			<p>If the investigator&#146;s attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to make an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual &#150;4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.</p>
			<p>The investigator must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. An investigator cannot use studied strike against a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Alchemy (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can create alchemical items with astounding speed. It takes an investigator half the normal amount of time to create alchemical items. He can also apply poison to a weapon as a move action instead of a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>True Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an investigator can use inspiration on all skill checks&#151;even ones he isn&#146;t trained in&#151;and all ability checks without spending inspiration.</p>
			<p>In addition, whenever he expends inspiration on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can affect this. If using the amazing inspiration investigator talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If using this with empathy, tenacious inspiration, underworld inspiration, or a similar talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the higher of the two results.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A mastermind&#146;s reputation precedes him. At 1st level, once per day a mastermind can spend 10 minutes preparing an ally to make a single Diplomacy or Intimidate check (mastermind&#146;s choice when preparing the ally) within the next 24-hour period at the mastermind&#146;s behest. This skill check uses the mastermind&#146;s skill ranks instead of the ally&#146;s. The mastermind&#146;s affected ally still uses its own ability bonus for the check.</p>
					<p>Furthermore, when a mastermind uses this ability, he can expend one use of inspiration to give the ally use of the inspiration die when making the check.</p>
					<p>At 3rd level, a mastermind can use this ability an additional time each day, and the number of times he can use this ability per day increases by 1 for every third level thereafter. Multiple uses of this ability on the same ally grant that ally the benef it on additional Diplomacy or Intimidate checks.</p>
					<p>At 12th level, a mastermind can use this ability to bestow on his ally the use of his skill ranks, similar to the 1stlevel effects of this ability but with a wider range of skills to choose from. The mastermind can only bestow this for a skill check that he can use inspiration on without expending uses of inspiration. For instance, a mastermind with the underworld inspiration talent can bolster his ally&#146;s Bluff, Disable Device, Disguise, or Sleight of Hand skill checks, selecting a single skill for each use of the ability. This ability replaces trapfinding and trap sense.</p>

					<p>At 9th level, a mastermind&#146;s secrecy, obscurity, and mental conditioning reach superhuman levels. He becomes immune to any divination spell, spell-like ability, or effect that allows a saving throw (though he can still allow a divination effect to affect him if he wishes). Even divination effects that do not allow a saving throw have diff iculty piercing a mastermind&#146;s barriers, as a mastermind can now choose to think in any language he speaks. Unless the opponent reading a mastermind&#146;s thoughts speaks all of the mastermind&#146;s languages, attempts at thought reading automatically fail. This ability replaces the investigator talent gained at 9th level.</p>

					<p>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
					<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Although some investigators use their honed senses and cunning insight for personal gain, no one excels at such endeavors like the mastermind. Typically, these investigators dwell at the centers of complex networks of lies, minions, or simply precious information, from which they dispense commands, threats, and rumors, all carefully crafted to increase the power of their peculiar empires. While masterminds often act as the heads of illicit organizations like criminal families, thieves&#146; guilds, or corruptionriddled bureaucracies, they aren&#146;t always evil.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon. Mixing gumption and learnedness into a personal alchemy of daring, investigators are full of surprises. Observing the world around them, they gain valuable knowledge about the situation they&#146;re in, process that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut to the quick of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators are always evaluating situations they encounter, sizing up potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers, all while using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to find solutions to the most perplexing problems.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Investigators live to solve mysteries and find inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as advisors and support for their adventuring parties, but can take center stage when knowledge and cunning are needed. No slouches in battle, they know how to make surprise attacks and use inspiration to bring those attacks home.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Alchemist and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Investigator's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Investigators are proficient with simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, short sword, and sword caneUE. They are proficient in light armors, but not shields.</p>
			<p><b>A Quiet Word (Ex): </b>A mastermind&#146;s reputation precedes him. At 1st level, once per day a mastermind can spend 10 minutes preparing an ally to make a single Diplomacy or Intimidate check (mastermind&#146;s choice when preparing the ally) within the next 24-hour period at the mastermind&#146;s behest. This skill check uses the mastermind&#146;s skill ranks instead of the ally&#146;s. The mastermind&#146;s affected ally still uses its own ability bonus for the check.</p>
			<p>Furthermore, when a mastermind uses this ability, he can expend one use of inspiration to give the ally use of the inspiration die when making the check.</p>
			<p>At 3rd level, a mastermind can use this ability an additional time each day, and the number of times he can use this ability per day increases by 1 for every third level thereafter. Multiple uses of this ability on the same ally grant that ally the benef it on additional Diplomacy or Intimidate checks.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a mastermind can use this ability to bestow on his ally the use of his skill ranks, similar to the 1stlevel effects of this ability but with a wider range of skills to choose from. The mastermind can only bestow this for a skill check that he can use inspiration on without expending uses of inspiration. For instance, a mastermind with the underworld inspiration talent can bolster his ally&#146;s Bluff, Disable Device, Disguise, or Sleight of Hand skill checks, selecting a single skill for each use of the ability. This ability replaces trapfinding and trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Alchemy (Su): </b>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
			<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
			<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
			<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
			<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
			<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
			<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
			<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
			<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Mastermind&#146;s Inspiration (Ex): </b>A mastermind can use inspiration on any Diplomacy and Intimidate checks without expending a use of inspiration, but can't do so for Linguistics or Spellcraft checks. This ability alters inspiration.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Lore (Ex): </b>An investigator has a deep understanding and appreciation for poisons. At 2nd level, he cannot accidentally poison himself when applying poison to a weapon. If the investigator spends 1 minute physically examining the poison, he can attempt a Knowledge (nature) check to identify any natural poison or Knowledge (arcana) check to identify any magical poison (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC). Lastly, once a poison is identified, he can spend 1 minute and attempt a Craft (alchemy) check (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC) to neutralize 1 dose of the poison. Success renders the dose harmless. The investigator has no chance of accidentally poisoning himself when examining or attempting to neutralize a poison.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Resistance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, an investigator gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against poison. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level, and to +6 at 8th level. At 11th level, the investigator becomes completely immune to poison.</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talent (Ex or Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can only be selected once.</p>
			<p>Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an investigator&#146;s studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p>See the Investigator Talents section for a full list of Talents from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Keen Recollection: </b>At 3rd level, an investigator can attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Combat (Ex): </b>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Strike (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a free action, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.</p>
			<p>If the investigator&#146;s attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to make an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual &#150;4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.</p>
			<p>The investigator must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. An investigator cannot use studied strike against a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Mastermind Defense (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a mastermind can, as an immediate action, expend two uses of inspiration to make an inspired defense. He rolls his inspiration die and applies the result as a penalty on an attack roll made against him. If the mastermind has the combat inspiration talent, he can expend one use of inspiration instead of two. This ability replaces swift alchemy.</p>
			<p><b>Impregnable Mind (Su): </b>At 9th level, a mastermind&#146;s secrecy, obscurity, and mental conditioning reach superhuman levels. He becomes immune to any divination spell, spell-like ability, or effect that allows a saving throw (though he can still allow a divination effect to affect him if he wishes). Even divination effects that do not allow a saving throw have diff iculty piercing a mastermind&#146;s barriers, as a mastermind can now choose to think in any language he speaks. Unless the opponent reading a mastermind&#146;s thoughts speaks all of the mastermind&#146;s languages, attempts at thought reading automatically fail. This ability replaces the investigator talent gained at 9th level.</p>
			<p><b>True Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an investigator can use inspiration on all skill checks&#151;even ones he isn&#146;t trained in&#151;and all ability checks without spending inspiration.</p>
			<p>In addition, whenever he expends inspiration on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can affect this. If using the amazing inspiration investigator talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If using this with empathy, tenacious inspiration, underworld inspiration, or a similar talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the higher of the two results.</p>

				<name type="string">Fettering</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A malice binder forgoes alchemy for the study of sympathetic magic that allows him to hinder foes. Fetters rely on the magical resonance of creatures capable of casting spells (spellcasters and creatures with spell-like abilities) which saturates even their hair and clothing. Fetters cannot target a creature with no magical ability. The malice binder knows one fetter at 1st level and gains another at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter.</p>
					<p>Every fetter requires a token taken from his desired target: a few hairs, a lost tooth, nail clippings, a scrap of clothing, or a small treasured possession with some significance. An investigator can obtain a single token in any of the following ways: a successful Sleight of Hand check against an unsuspecting target, a successful steal combat maneuver, or a successful Perception check (DC = 15 + the creature&#146;s CR) to search an area his target occupied for at least 2 hours. Malice binders can search such a location for additional tokens, but each subsequent Perception check increases the DC by 5, regardless of success or failure. Tokens rely on the magic that clings to spellcasters and creatures with spell-like abilities; they must be carefully preserved as soon as they are recovered and before they can be used. Preparing a token requires a move action, and a malice binder can maintain one prepared token per class level. Each token can be used only to power a fetter targeting the creature it came from, and it is consumed in the process. At 7th level, the malice binder can instead prepare a token as a swift action.</p>
					<p>The DC to resist a fetter is equal to 10 + half the investigator&#146;s class level + the investigator&#146;s Charisma bonus. Activating a fetter is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, and unless otherwise stated the target must be within 30 feet, plus 5 feet per 2 levels. Once a creature has been the target of a specific fetter, it is immune to that effect for 24 hours.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A lock of hair, a bit of blood, even a footprint is enough to grant a wily witch hunter an edge. Malice binders often rise from the ranks of the common folk rather than from wealthy nobles or the church. Their magic is old and crude, but devastatingly effective against those they hunt.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon. Mixing gumption and learnedness into a personal alchemy of daring, investigators are full of surprises. Observing the world around them, they gain valuable knowledge about the situation they&#146;re in, process that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut to the quick of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators are always evaluating situations they encounter, sizing up potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers, all while using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to find solutions to the most perplexing problems.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Investigators live to solve mysteries and find inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as advisors and support for their adventuring parties, but can take center stage when knowledge and cunning are needed. No slouches in battle, they know how to make surprise attacks and use inspiration to bring those attacks home.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Alchemist and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Investigator's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Investigators are proficient with simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, short sword, and sword caneUE. They are proficient in light armors, but not shields.</p>
			<p><b>Fettering (Su): </b>A malice binder forgoes alchemy for the study of sympathetic magic that allows him to hinder foes. Fetters rely on the magical resonance of creatures capable of casting spells (spellcasters and creatures with spell-like abilities) which saturates even their hair and clothing. Fetters cannot target a creature with no magical ability. The malice binder knows one fetter at 1st level and gains another at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter.</p>
			<p>Every fetter requires a token taken from his desired target: a few hairs, a lost tooth, nail clippings, a scrap of clothing, or a small treasured possession with some significance. An investigator can obtain a single token in any of the following ways: a successful Sleight of Hand check against an unsuspecting target, a successful steal combat maneuver, or a successful Perception check (DC = 15 + the creature&#146;s CR) to search an area his target occupied for at least 2 hours. Malice binders can search such a location for additional tokens, but each subsequent Perception check increases the DC by 5, regardless of success or failure. Tokens rely on the magic that clings to spellcasters and creatures with spell-like abilities; they must be carefully preserved as soon as they are recovered and before they can be used. Preparing a token requires a move action, and a malice binder can maintain one prepared token per class level. Each token can be used only to power a fetter targeting the creature it came from, and it is consumed in the process. At 7th level, the malice binder can instead prepare a token as a swift action.</p>
			<p>The DC to resist a fetter is equal to 10 + half the investigator&#146;s class level + the investigator&#146;s Charisma bonus. Activating a fetter is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, and unless otherwise stated the target must be within 30 feet, plus 5 feet per 2 levels. Once a creature has been the target of a specific fetter, it is immune to that effect for 24 hours.</p>
			<p>This replaces alchemy.</p>
			<p><i>Divine Dread (Su): </i>Binding a token to a holy symbol anathema to the target fills the creature with supernatural dread, imposing the shaken condition for 1 round per class level. At 6th level, the target is frightened instead. At 11th level, the target becomes panicked instead. On a successful Will saving throw, the target is instead shaken for a single round.</p>
			<p><i>Hexing Shield (Su): </i>By placing a token between two shiny copper coins and then putting them in a creature&#146;s mouth, the malice binder can ward himself or others. This fetter grants whoever holds it in his mouth a +2 resistance bonus on Will saving throws against the target&#146;s spells, supernatural abilities, and spell-like abilities. The fetter lasts 10 minutes per class level, but whoever holds it in his mouth cannot eat, drink, speak, or cast spells with verbal components without ending the effect early. At 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the resistance bonus granted improves by 1, to a maximum of +8 at 19th level. The malice binder can have only one hexing shield active at a time.</p>
			<p><i>Incapacitate (Su): </i>By rubbing soot into a token, the malice binder clouds his target&#146;s senses or stifles the target&#146;s tongue. This fetter deafens or silences the target for 1 round per 2 class levels (minimum 1 round). Silenced creatures cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components, but they are otherwise unrestricted from making sounds. At 6th level, a malice binder can either blind his target or both silence and deafen it. On a successful Will saving throw, the target is instead dazzled for a single round.</p>
			<p><i>Repulse (Su): </i>By binding a token to a bit of rancid meat, the malice binder can impede his target&#146;s approach. Once activated, this fetter forces its target to spend twice the normal amount of movement to approach the fetter while within range of its effect; it does not affect the target&#146;s ability to move away. At 11th level, the fetter&#146;s target cannot physically approach within 10 feet of the fetter, as if affected by a repulsion spell. This fetter remains active for 1 minute per class level and can be handed to another creature or left somewhere to ward against a witch&#146;s entry. A target can overcome this effect with a successful Will saving throw when the fetter is first activated.</p>
			<p><i>Salting Wounds (Su): </i>The malice binder can rub salt into a wound&#151;his own or that of an adjacent ally&#151;treating the wound as a token to protect the injured creature from the danger that threatens it. This fetter grants a +2 deflection bonus to AC against attacks from the creature that caused the original wound, which is treated as the fetter&#146;s target for the purposes of how often it can be used. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, the deflection bonus to AC increases by 1, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. This fetter is painful to whom it protects, sickening the protected creature while the fetter remains in effect.</p>
			<p><i>Shackle (Su): </i>Binding a token to manacles or a length of rope causes the restraints to fly out and entangle the target. A target can avoid this fetter with a successful Reflex save. An entangled target can attempt to escape as a standard action with either an Escape Artist check or a combat maneuver check using the same DC as the initial saving throw. Using masterwork manacles in this fetter increases the escape DC by 2.</p>
			<p><i>Temptation (Su): </i>Anointing a token with incense or scented oils creates a supernaturally appealing object to attract a target&#146;s attention. Once activated, this fetter lasts for 1 minute per class level. If the target approaches within the fetter&#146;s area of effect, it is compelled to approach the fetter and pick it up; the compulsion can be negated with a successful Will save. This effect ends immediately if the target picks up the fetter or the fetter moves more than 30 feet plus 5 feet per 2 levels away from the target. At 11th level, the fetter fascinates its target once picked up, affecting it as if by the spell hypnotism for 1 round per class level; this fetter is not limited by the target&#146;s Hit Dice.</p>
			<p><i>Witch Compass (Su): </i>Placing a token on top of a compass causes the needle to point toward the malice binder&#146;s target for 1 hour per class level, granting a +10 circumstance bonus on Survival checks to track that creature. The target must be within 1 mile per class level, or else the needle spins aimlessly.</p>
			<p>Wrack (Su): The binder can drive an iron nail through a token to leave his target sickened with pain until the end of the malice binder&#146;s next turn. At 6th level, the target is instead staggered until the end of the malice binder&#146;s next turn. The target can negate this fetter with a successful Fortitude save. For this fetter, a binder can use a clear footprint as a token; finding an appropriate footprint requires a successful Survival skill check to track the target.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
			<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
			<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Take a Bit (Ex): </b>The malice binder gains Improved Steal as a bonus feat at 1st level. At 3rd level, he can use inspiration to improve a steal combat maneuver check by spending one use of inspiration rather than two.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Lore (Ex): </b>An investigator has a deep understanding and appreciation for poisons. At 2nd level, he cannot accidentally poison himself when applying poison to a weapon. If the investigator spends 1 minute physically examining the poison, he can attempt a Knowledge (nature) check to identify any natural poison or Knowledge (arcana) check to identify any magical poison (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC). Lastly, once a poison is identified, he can spend 1 minute and attempt a Craft (alchemy) check (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC) to neutralize 1 dose of the poison. Success renders the dose harmless. The investigator has no chance of accidentally poisoning himself when examining or attempting to neutralize a poison.</p>
			<p><b>Witch Lore (Ex): </b>Malice binders hunt and kill those who would plague the world with supernatural power. A malice binder can use inspiration on Knowledge (arcana), Spellcraft, Sleight of Hand, and Survival checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he is trained in the skill, rather than on any Knowledge and Linguistics checks. He can later spend an investigator talent to gain the ability to use inspiration on any Knowledge and Linguistics checks.</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talent (Ex or Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can only be selected once.</p>
			<p>Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an investigator&#146;s studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p>See the Investigator Talents section for a full list of Talents from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Keen Recollection: </b>At 3rd level, an investigator can attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Combat (Ex): </b>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Strike (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a free action, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.</p>
			<p>If the investigator&#146;s attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to make an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual &#150;4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.</p>
			<p>The investigator must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. An investigator cannot use studied strike against a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Alchemy (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can create alchemical items with astounding speed. It takes an investigator half the normal amount of time to create alchemical items. He can also apply poison to a weapon as a move action instead of a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>Take a Bit More (Ex): </b>At 8th level, taking a bit of clothing or hair to use as a token becomes second nature for the malice binder. He gains Quick Steal as a bonus feat. When attempting to steal a token, he gains a +2 competence bonus on combat maneuver checks.</p>
			<p><b>Witch Trapper (Ex): </b>Beginning at 11th level, whenever the malice binder would gain a fetter, he can instead select a ranger trap (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 64), treating his investigator level as his ranger level for the purpose of determining the trap&#146;s effect.</p>
			<p><b>True Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an investigator can use inspiration on all skill checks&#151;even ones he isn&#146;t trained in&#151;and all ability checks without spending inspiration.</p>
			<p>In addition, whenever he expends inspiration on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can affect this. If using the amazing inspiration investigator talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If using this with empathy, tenacious inspiration, underworld inspiration, or a similar talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the higher of the two results.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>In order to perform all the necessary tasks of her household, a majordomo quickly learns how to delegate. At 1st level and every 3 investigator levels thereafter, a majordomo gains a bonus teamwork feat. As a standard action, she can grant all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear her one of these teamwork feats (even if they don&#146;t meet the prerequisites) for a number of rounds equal to 3 + her investigator level. She can use this ability once per day at 1st level, plus an additional time at 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter.</p>
					<p>At 4th level, a majordomo can use her delegate ability and designate a single noncombat task that could make use of the teamwork feat (for instance, designating the Cooperative CraftingAPG feat and a session of crafting). As long as the allies pursue the task uninterrupted, instead of experiencing the benefits for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the majordomo&#146;s investigator level, her allies retain the benefits until the task is complete, to a maximum of 8 hours. Additionally, the majordomo can use her delegate ability as a move action instead of a standard action.</p>
					<p>At 7th level, a majordomo can use her delegate ability to grant two teamwork feats to her allies, instead of one feat. At 10th level, she can also use her delegate ability as a swift action. At 13th level, she can grant up to three teamwork feats to her allies when she uses delegate.</p>
					<p>At 16th level, she can spend 1 minute and use her delegate ability to grant a single teamwork feat to all of her allies until the next time she recovers uses of her delegate ability. As usual for multiple uses of the same ability, if she later uses delegate to grant three teamwork feats, the two uses don&#146;t stack to grant four bonus teamwork feats, but the longer-duration teamwork feat returns after the three shorter-duration feats expire.</p>
					<p>This ability replaces the alchemy and swift alchemy abilities. Additionally, a majordomo can&#146;t take the alchemist discovery investigator talent or any discovery that affects or involves alchemy.</p>

				<name type="string">Inspiration</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
					<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
					<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>

					<p>A majordomo who analyzes the handwriting of a document and succeeds at a Linguistics check against a DC equal to 20 + the writer&#146;s Bluff bonus gets a hunch about whether the document&#146;s writer was lying or otherwise nervous. This ability doesn&#146;t work if the document was dictated to someone who thought the contents were legitimate.</p>

					<p>An investigator has a deep understanding and appreciation for poisons. At 2nd level, he cannot accidentally poison himself when applying poison to a weapon. If the investigator spends 1 minute physically examining the poison, he can attempt a Knowledge (nature) check to identify any natural poison or Knowledge (arcana) check to identify any magical poison (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC). Lastly, once a poison is identified, he can spend 1 minute and attempt a Craft (alchemy) check (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC) to neutralize 1 dose of the poison. Success renders the dose harmless. The investigator has no chance of accidentally poisoning himself when examining or attempting to neutralize a poison.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A majordomo is a skilled individual able to keep the complex operations of a noble&#146;s holdings running on a day-to-day basis. In a world of intrigue where the loyalties of staff can be bought and sold, sometimes it takes the skills of an investigator to follow the byzantine paper trails and prevent embezzling and espionage within the estates of the elite.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon. Mixing gumption and learnedness into a personal alchemy of daring, investigators are full of surprises. Observing the world around them, they gain valuable knowledge about the situation they&#146;re in, process that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut to the quick of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators are always evaluating situations they encounter, sizing up potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers, all while using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to find solutions to the most perplexing problems.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Investigators live to solve mysteries and find inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as advisors and support for their adventuring parties, but can take center stage when knowledge and cunning are needed. No slouches in battle, they know how to make surprise attacks and use inspiration to bring those attacks home.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Alchemist and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Investigator's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Investigators are proficient with simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, short sword, and sword caneUE. They are proficient in light armors, but not shields.</p>
			<p><b>Delegate (Ex): </b>In order to perform all the necessary tasks of her household, a majordomo quickly learns how to delegate. At 1st level and every 3 investigator levels thereafter, a majordomo gains a bonus teamwork feat. As a standard action, she can grant all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear her one of these teamwork feats (even if they don&#146;t meet the prerequisites) for a number of rounds equal to 3 + her investigator level. She can use this ability once per day at 1st level, plus an additional time at 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter.</p>
			<p>At 4th level, a majordomo can use her delegate ability and designate a single noncombat task that could make use of the teamwork feat (for instance, designating the Cooperative CraftingAPG feat and a session of crafting). As long as the allies pursue the task uninterrupted, instead of experiencing the benefits for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the majordomo&#146;s investigator level, her allies retain the benefits until the task is complete, to a maximum of 8 hours. Additionally, the majordomo can use her delegate ability as a move action instead of a standard action.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a majordomo can use her delegate ability to grant two teamwork feats to her allies, instead of one feat. At 10th level, she can also use her delegate ability as a swift action. At 13th level, she can grant up to three teamwork feats to her allies when she uses delegate.</p>
			<p>At 16th level, she can spend 1 minute and use her delegate ability to grant a single teamwork feat to all of her allies until the next time she recovers uses of her delegate ability. As usual for multiple uses of the same ability, if she later uses delegate to grant three teamwork feats, the two uses don&#146;t stack to grant four bonus teamwork feats, but the longer-duration teamwork feat returns after the three shorter-duration feats expire.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the alchemy and swift alchemy abilities. Additionally, a majordomo can&#146;t take the alchemist discovery investigator talent or any discovery that affects or involves alchemy.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
			<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
			<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Paper Trail (Ex): </b>A majordomo is trained to uncover forgeries and trace down discrepancies in paperwork in order to ferret out intrigue. She adds half her investigator level (minimum 1) to Linguistics and Profession checks to spot a forgery, deal with paperwork, and notice discrepancies in paperwork.</p>
			<p>A majordomo who analyzes the handwriting of a document and succeeds at a Linguistics check against a DC equal to 20 + the writer&#146;s Bluff bonus gets a hunch about whether the document&#146;s writer was lying or otherwise nervous. This ability doesn&#146;t work if the document was dictated to someone who thought the contents were legitimate.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Lore (Ex): </b>An investigator has a deep understanding and appreciation for poisons. At 2nd level, he cannot accidentally poison himself when applying poison to a weapon. If the investigator spends 1 minute physically examining the poison, he can attempt a Knowledge (nature) check to identify any natural poison or Knowledge (arcana) check to identify any magical poison (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC). Lastly, once a poison is identified, he can spend 1 minute and attempt a Craft (alchemy) check (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC) to neutralize 1 dose of the poison. Success renders the dose harmless. The investigator has no chance of accidentally poisoning himself when examining or attempting to neutralize a poison.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Resistance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, an investigator gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against poison. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level, and to +6 at 8th level. At 11th level, the investigator becomes completely immune to poison.</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talent (Ex or Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can only be selected once.</p>
			<p>Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an investigator&#146;s studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p>See the Investigator Talents section for a full list of Talents from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Keen Recollection: </b>At 3rd level, an investigator can attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Inspired Manager (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a majordomo knows how to make just about any work task more efficient, from cleaning a great hall after a big party to crafting a magic item.</p>
			<p>Whenever an ally begins a workday task such as Craft, Profession, magic item creation, spell research, managing a kingdom, using the downtime rules, or other similar tasks, the majordomo can spend one use of inspiration and 1 minute of planning to create a plan for that ally. If the ally chooses to follow the majordomo&#146;s plan and attempts the task on the same day, if the task would normally take at least 4 hours, it instead takes 30 minutes less time, and if the task would normally take at least 8 hours, it instead takes 1 hour less time.</p>
			<p>If using the kingdom-building rules from Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Campaign, at 3rd level, the majordomo counts her Intelligence score as 2 higher when determining the bonus she provides in a kingdom leadership role. Her effective Intelligence score increases by an additional 2 at 6th level and every 3 investigator levels thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Combat (Ex): </b>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Strike (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a free action, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.</p>
			<p>If the investigator&#146;s attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to make an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual &#150;4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.</p>
			<p>The investigator must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. An investigator cannot use studied strike against a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>True Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an investigator can use inspiration on all skill checks&#151;even ones he isn&#146;t trained in&#151;and all ability checks without spending inspiration.</p>
			<p>In addition, whenever he expends inspiration on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can affect this. If using the amazing inspiration investigator talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If using this with empathy, tenacious inspiration, underworld inspiration, or a similar talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the higher of the two results.</p>

					<p>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
					<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
					<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
					<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
					<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
					<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
					<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
					<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>

					<p>At 5th level, a Lepidstadt inspector can learn enough about a suspect through observation that he can deduce the most effective way to deal with the subject. Once per day, if a Lepidstadt inspector finds a creature&#146;s tracks using perceptive tracking, he gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against or about that creature, as well as on weapon attack and damage rolls against that creature. These bonuses last until the Lepidstadt inspector selects a new subject for relentless pursuit. This ability replaces swift alchemy and the investigator talent gained at 5th level.</p>

					<p>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
					<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The ability of investigators trained at the University of Lepidstadt to get to the bottom of a mystery is legendary, and troubled settlements throughout the region often send petitions to the university requesting the aid of a formally trained inspector when some mystery threatens the community as a whole. These inspectors are tasked with assuming nothing and asking difficult and unpopular questions as necessary to get to the truth behind a problem. Inspectors are well-prepared to deal with mystical threats, but they are also mindful that what some claim are supernatural problems may well be just the result of more mundane threats such as bandits, wild beasts, or public hysteria.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon. Mixing gumption and learnedness into a personal alchemy of daring, investigators are full of surprises. Observing the world around them, they gain valuable knowledge about the situation they&#146;re in, process that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut to the quick of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators are always evaluating situations they encounter, sizing up potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers, all while using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to find solutions to the most perplexing problems.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Investigators live to solve mysteries and find inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as advisors and support for their adventuring parties, but can take center stage when knowledge and cunning are needed. No slouches in battle, they know how to make surprise attacks and use inspiration to bring those attacks home.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Alchemist and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Investigator's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Investigators are proficient with simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, short sword, and sword caneUE. They are proficient in light armors, but not shields.</p>
			<p><b>Alchemy (Su): </b>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
			<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
			<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
			<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
			<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
			<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
			<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
			<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
			<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>An investigator adds 1/2 his level to Perception skill checks made to locate traps and to Disable Device checks (minimum 1). An investigator can use Disable Device to disarm magical traps.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Lore (Ex): </b>An investigator has a deep understanding and appreciation for poisons. At 2nd level, he cannot accidentally poison himself when applying poison to a weapon. If the investigator spends 1 minute physically examining the poison, he can attempt a Knowledge (nature) check to identify any natural poison or Knowledge (arcana) check to identify any magical poison (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC). Lastly, once a poison is identified, he can spend 1 minute and attempt a Craft (alchemy) check (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC) to neutralize 1 dose of the poison. Success renders the dose harmless. The investigator has no chance of accidentally poisoning himself when examining or attempting to neutralize a poison.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Resistance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, an investigator gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against poison. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level, and to +6 at 8th level. At 11th level, the investigator becomes completely immune to poison.</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talent (Ex or Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can only be selected once.</p>
			<p>Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an investigator&#146;s studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p>See the Investigator Talents section for a full list of Talents from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Keen Recollection: </b>At 3rd level, an investigator can attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Trap Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, an investigator gains an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps, granting him a +1 bonus on Ref lex saving throws to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by traps. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1 (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).</p>
			<p><b>Studied Combat (Ex): </b>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Strike (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a free action, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.</p>
			<p>If the investigator&#146;s attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to make an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual &#150;4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.</p>
			<p>The investigator must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. An investigator cannot use studied strike against a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Alchemy (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can create alchemical items with astounding speed. It takes an investigator half the normal amount of time to create alchemical items. He can also apply poison to a weapon as a move action instead of a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>True Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an investigator can use inspiration on all skill checks&#151;even ones he isn&#146;t trained in&#151;and all ability checks without spending inspiration.</p>
			<p>In addition, whenever he expends inspiration on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can affect this. If using the amazing inspiration investigator talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If using this with empathy, tenacious inspiration, underworld inspiration, or a similar talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the higher of the two results.</p>

If the spell has a range of touch, the lantern or torch counts as the object touched. The spell&#146;s DC, if any, equals 10 + spell level + the lamplighter&#146;s Intelligence modifier. At 2nd level, the lamplighter can cast light and continual flame (24 hour duration). At 5th level, the lamplighter can cast daylight and discovery torchUC. At 8th level, the lamplighter can cast searing light. At 11th level, the lamplighter can cast judgment lightUC. The lamplighter need not have an active judgment to cast this spell, can choose what color of judgment light is created, can use his alignment for golden light, and can select any element for copper light. This ability replaces poison lore, poison resistance, and poison immunity.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Lamplighters are investigators tasked with keeping the night streets safe and lit, and securing darkened areas against whatever dangers lurk in the shadows. They also investigate those who seek to hide their crimes from the light of day.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon. Mixing gumption and learnedness into a personal alchemy of daring, investigators are full of surprises. Observing the world around them, they gain valuable knowledge about the situation they&#146;re in, process that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut to the quick of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators are always evaluating situations they encounter, sizing up potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers, all while using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to find solutions to the most perplexing problems.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Investigators live to solve mysteries and find inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as advisors and support for their adventuring parties, but can take center stage when knowledge and cunning are needed. No slouches in battle, they know how to make surprise attacks and use inspiration to bring those attacks home.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Alchemist and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Investigator's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Investigators are proficient with simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, short sword, and sword caneUE. They are proficient in light armors, but not shields.</p>
			<p><b>Alchemy (Su): </b>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
			<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
			<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
			<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
			<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
			<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
			<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
			<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
			<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Lamplighter (Su): </b>At 1st level, a lamplighter can take a move action to create a small flame that immediately ignites a lamp, torch, or similar flammable item he&#146;s holding.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>An investigator adds 1/2 his level to Perception skill checks made to locate traps and to Disable Device checks (minimum 1). An investigator can use Disable Device to disarm magical traps.</p>
			<p><b>Alchemical Illumination (Sp): </b>At 2nd level, as a standard action, a lamplighter can cast certain light spells by burning a magic extract, infusion, or potion of a spell of the same or greater level than the light spell in a lit lantern or torch. If the spell has a range of touch, the lantern or torch counts as the object touched. The spell&#146;s DC, if any, equals 10 + spell level + the lamplighter&#146;s Intelligence modifier. At 2nd level, the lamplighter can cast light and continual flame (24 hour duration). At 5th level, the lamplighter can cast daylight and discovery torchUC. At 8th level, the lamplighter can cast searing light. At 11th level, the lamplighter can cast judgment lightUC. The lamplighter need not have an active judgment to cast this spell, can choose what color of judgment light is created, can use his alignment for golden light, and can select any element for copper light. This ability replaces poison lore, poison resistance, and poison immunity.</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talent (Ex or Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can only be selected once.</p>
			<p>Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an investigator&#146;s studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p>See the Investigator Talents section for a full list of Talents from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Ready for the Revelation (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a lamplighter can use inspiration on initiative checks without spending a use of inspiration. He can use his Intelligence modifier in place of his Dexterity modifier on initiative checks. At 6th level, if the lamplighter has Quick Draw, he can draw a weapon as part of his initiative check. At 9th level, the lamplighter isn&#146;t flat-footed before he acts in the first round of combat. At 12th level, the lamplighter adds his Intelligence bonus as well as his Dexterity bonus to initiative checks. At 15th level, the lamplighter can act last during the surprise round even if he is otherwise unaware combat has started. At 18th level, the lamplighter is not limited to just a move or standard action during the surprise round&#151;he can act normally. This ability replaces keen recollection and trap sense.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Combat (Ex): </b>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Strike (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a free action, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.</p>
			<p>If the investigator&#146;s attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to make an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual &#150;4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.</p>
			<p>The investigator must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. An investigator cannot use studied strike against a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Alchemy (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can create alchemical items with astounding speed. It takes an investigator half the normal amount of time to create alchemical items. He can also apply poison to a weapon as a move action instead of a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>True Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an investigator can use inspiration on all skill checks&#151;even ones he isn&#146;t trained in&#151;and all ability checks without spending inspiration.</p>
			<p>In addition, whenever he expends inspiration on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can affect this. If using the amazing inspiration investigator talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If using this with empathy, tenacious inspiration, underworld inspiration, or a similar talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the higher of the two results.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
					<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
					<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>

					<p>An investigator has a deep understanding and appreciation for poisons. At 2nd level, he cannot accidentally poison himself when applying poison to a weapon. If the investigator spends 1 minute physically examining the poison, he can attempt a Knowledge (nature) check to identify any natural poison or Knowledge (arcana) check to identify any magical poison (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC). Lastly, once a poison is identified, he can spend 1 minute and attempt a Craft (alchemy) check (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC) to neutralize 1 dose of the poison. Success renders the dose harmless. The investigator has no chance of accidentally poisoning himself when examining or attempting to neutralize a poison.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Lung Wa&#146;s corruption and political decay led to its eventual collapse, but the empire did not spend its last decades in surrender. A special task force of secret police, known as the jinyiwei, was one of Lung Wa&#146;s last bulwarks against this decline. The jinyiwei were unable to save the empire; they failed in their mission to root out, expose, and counteract their government&#146;s existing wrongdoing, and the organization itself ultimately fell prey to the same political decline that rotted Lung Wa&#146;s bureaucracy. However, their legacy now inspires purists who seek out and eliminate corruption wherever they find it. Since the earthly government of Lung Wa has failed, these new jinyiwei claim they act under the celestial government&#146;s mandate.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon. Mixing gumption and learnedness into a personal alchemy of daring, investigators are full of surprises. Observing the world around them, they gain valuable knowledge about the situation they&#146;re in, process that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut to the quick of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators are always evaluating situations they encounter, sizing up potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers, all while using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to find solutions to the most perplexing problems.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Investigators live to solve mysteries and find inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as advisors and support for their adventuring parties, but can take center stage when knowledge and cunning are needed. No slouches in battle, they know how to make surprise attacks and use inspiration to bring those attacks home.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Alchemist and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Investigator's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Investigators are proficient with simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, short sword, and sword caneUE. They are proficient in light armors, but not shields.</p>
			<p><b>Divine Inspiration: </b>A jinyiwei follows a mandate from Heaven to combat corruption in the mortal world. A jinyiwei adds her Wisdom modifier to her inspiration pool, rather than her Intelligence modifier. Additionally, rather than dabbling in the arcane arts of alchemy, a jinyiwei is empowered by the forces of celestial bureaucracy. She casts spells as an inquisitor of the same level.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
			<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
			<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Suspicious Mind (Ex): </b>A jinyiwei adds half her level (minimum 1) to Sense Motive checks, Linguistics checks to detect forgeries, and Perception checks to see through disguises, locate creatures using Stealth, or locate a secret door or compartment.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Lore (Ex): </b>An investigator has a deep understanding and appreciation for poisons. At 2nd level, he cannot accidentally poison himself when applying poison to a weapon. If the investigator spends 1 minute physically examining the poison, he can attempt a Knowledge (nature) check to identify any natural poison or Knowledge (arcana) check to identify any magical poison (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC). Lastly, once a poison is identified, he can spend 1 minute and attempt a Craft (alchemy) check (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC) to neutralize 1 dose of the poison. Success renders the dose harmless. The investigator has no chance of accidentally poisoning himself when examining or attempting to neutralize a poison.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Resistance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, an investigator gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against poison. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level, and to +6 at 8th level. At 11th level, the investigator becomes completely immune to poison.</p>
			<p><b>Celestial Insight (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a jinyiwei learns to see through the types of magic that often lead others astray. She gains a +1 competence bonus on saving throws to resist enchantment and illusion effects. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1 (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talent (Ex or Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can only be selected once.</p>
			<p>Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an investigator&#146;s studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p>See the Investigator Talents section for a full list of Talents from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Keen Recollection: </b>At 3rd level, an investigator can attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Imperial Judgment (Su): </b>At 4th level, a jinyiwei can carry out trial and sentence with her own divine authority. She gains the judgment inquisitor class feature as an inquisitor 3 levels lower than her investigator level, and her investigator levels stack with inquisitor levels for the purposes of determining her judgments&#146; abilities and number of judgments per day. At 11th level, she gains the second judgment inquisitor class feature, and at 19th level, she gains the third judgment inquisitor class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Combat (Ex): </b>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Strike (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a free action, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.</p>
			<p>If the investigator&#146;s attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to make an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual &#150;4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.</p>
			<p>The investigator must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. An investigator cannot use studied strike against a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>True Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an investigator can use inspiration on all skill checks&#151;even ones he isn&#146;t trained in&#151;and all ability checks without spending inspiration.</p>
			<p>In addition, whenever he expends inspiration on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can affect this. If using the amazing inspiration investigator talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If using this with empathy, tenacious inspiration, underworld inspiration, or a similar talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the higher of the two results.</p>

				<name type="string">Alchemy</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
					<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
					<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
					<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
					<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
					<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
					<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
					<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, an infiltrator can use disguise with great results. When disguising himself as a different gender, race, age category, or size category, an infiltrator reduces the penalties for each by &#150;2. For example, if the infiltrator disguises himself as a female two age categories older than himself, he would take a &#150;2 to the check instead of a &#150;6. Also, an infiltrator can disguise himself with 1d3 minutes of work (instead of the normal 1d3 10 minutes of work). This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>

				<level type="number">2</level>
				<name type="string">Voice Mimicry</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 2nd level, an infiltrator learns to mimic voices and sounds around him. Using this ability requires a special Disguise check, and creatures hearing the voice can make a Perception check to discover the ruse. An infiltrator can attempt to emulate any creature or other sound he&#146;s heard clearly for at least 1 minute. The bonuses or penalties to this special Disguise check are modified in the following ways, all of which are cumulative.</p>
					<table>
						<tr>
							<td><b>Disguised Voice</b></td>
							<td><b>Check Modifier</b></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Voice is not your own, but not that of a distinct individual</td>
							<td>+5</td>

							<td>&#150;2</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Voice is that of a different size category</td>
							<td>&#150;5</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
					<p>Also, the creature making the Perception check gains a bonus based on its familiarity with specific voices, just as if it were confronted with a normal disguise (Core Rulebook 95). This ability is a language-dependent effect, meaning that if a creature cannot hear or understand what the infiltrator is saying, the ruse fails. Magic items, feats, and traits that affect typical disguises do not affect this disguise check.</p>
					<p>At 8th level, the infiltrator gains the effects of its master of disguise class feature on this special use of the Disguise skill (no penalty for a voice of a different gender, race, or age category, and only a &#150;3 penalty for a different size category). This ability replaces poison lore.</p>

				<name type="string">Mimic Mastery</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 2nd level, when an infiltrator uses disguise self or any polymorph extracts on himself, he is treated as 2 investigator levels higher for the purpose of determining the duration of that extract&#146;s effect. He can use these extracts to take the appearance of specific individuals of the type of form he chooses, gaining a +10 to Disguise checks even if that extract does not typically grant such a bonus. Furthermore, these extracts grant the infiltrator a +10 bonus to Disguise checks made as part of his voice mimicry ability. This ability replaces poison resistance.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
					<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>An infiltrator specializes in investigating or disrupting groups from within. He uses his specialized set of skills and alchemical abilities to morph into the shape of the people or creatures whose company he&#146;s infiltrating, or even specific individuals.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon. Mixing gumption and learnedness into a personal alchemy of daring, investigators are full of surprises. Observing the world around them, they gain valuable knowledge about the situation they&#146;re in, process that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut to the quick of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators are always evaluating situations they encounter, sizing up potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers, all while using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to find solutions to the most perplexing problems.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Investigators live to solve mysteries and find inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as advisors and support for their adventuring parties, but can take center stage when knowledge and cunning are needed. No slouches in battle, they know how to make surprise attacks and use inspiration to bring those attacks home.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Alchemist and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Investigator's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Investigators are proficient with simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, short sword, and sword caneUE. They are proficient in light armors, but not shields.</p>
			<p><b>Alchemy (Su): </b>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
			<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
			<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
			<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
			<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
			<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
			<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
			<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
			<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Master of Disguise (Ex): </b>At 1st level, an infiltrator can use disguise with great results. When disguising himself as a different gender, race, age category, or size category, an infiltrator reduces the penalties for each by &#150;2. For example, if the infiltrator disguises himself as a female two age categories older than himself, he would take a &#150;2 to the check instead of a &#150;6. Also, an infiltrator can disguise himself with 1d3 minutes of work (instead of the normal 1d3 10 minutes of work). This ability replaces trapfinding.</p>
			<p><b>Mimic Mastery (Su): </b>At 2nd level, when an infiltrator uses disguise self or any polymorph extracts on himself, he is treated as 2 investigator levels higher for the purpose of determining the duration of that extract&#146;s effect. He can use these extracts to take the appearance of specific individuals of the type of form he chooses, gaining a +10 to Disguise checks even if that extract does not typically grant such a bonus. Furthermore, these extracts grant the infiltrator a +10 bonus to Disguise checks made as part of his voice mimicry ability. This ability replaces poison resistance.</p>
			<p><b>Voice Mimicry (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, an infiltrator learns to mimic voices and sounds around him. Using this ability requires a special Disguise check, and creatures hearing the voice can make a Perception check to discover the ruse. An infiltrator can attempt to emulate any creature or other sound he&#146;s heard clearly for at least 1 minute. The bonuses or penalties to this special Disguise check are modified in the following ways, all of which are cumulative.</p>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td><b>Disguised Voice</b></td>
					<td><b>Check Modifier</b></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Voice is not your own, but not that of a distinct individual</td>
					<td>+5</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Voice is that of a different gender</td>
					<td>&#150;2</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Voice is that of a different race</td>
					<td>&#150;2</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Voice is that of a different age category</td>
					<td>&#150;2</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Voice is that of a different size category</td>
					<td>&#150;5</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Also, the creature making the Perception check gains a bonus based on its familiarity with specific voices, just as if it were confronted with a normal disguise (Core Rulebook 95). This ability is a language-dependent effect, meaning that if a creature cannot hear or understand what the infiltrator is saying, the ruse fails. Magic items, feats, and traits that affect typical disguises do not affect this disguise check.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the infiltrator gains the effects of its master of disguise class feature on this special use of the Disguise skill (no penalty for a voice of a different gender, race, or age category, and only a &#150;3 penalty for a different size category). This ability replaces poison lore.</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talent (Ex or Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can only be selected once.</p>
			<p>Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an investigator&#146;s studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p>See the Investigator Talents section for a full list of Talents from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Keen Recollection: </b>At 3rd level, an investigator can attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Trap Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, an investigator gains an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps, granting him a +1 bonus on Ref lex saving throws to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by traps. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1 (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).</p>
			<p><b>Studied Combat (Ex): </b>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Strike (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a free action, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.</p>
			<p>If the investigator&#146;s attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to make an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual &#150;4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.</p>
			<p>The investigator must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. An investigator cannot use studied strike against a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Alchemy (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can create alchemical items with astounding speed. It takes an investigator half the normal amount of time to create alchemical items. He can also apply poison to a weapon as a move action instead of a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>True Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an investigator can use inspiration on all skill checks&#151;even ones he isn&#146;t trained in&#151;and all ability checks without spending inspiration.</p>
			<p>In addition, whenever he expends inspiration on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can affect this. If using the amazing inspiration investigator talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If using this with empathy, tenacious inspiration, underworld inspiration, or a similar talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the higher of the two results.</p>

At 11th level, he can attempt a sunder combat maneuver check against a wall no more than 5 feet thick. If the damage from the sunder combat maneuver exceeds the wall&#146;s hardness, the Holomog demolitionist creates a 5-foot opening in the wall, through which a Medium creature can easily pass.</p>

					<p>At 6th level, the investigator can create 10 feet of difficult terrain by spending a full-round action to analyze and manipulate his surroundings. This terrain can be in any shape designated by the investigator, but at least 1 square must be adjacent to his position. For every 4 levels he has beyond 6th, the investigator can create an additional 10 feet of difficult terrain, to a maximum of 40 feet at 18th level. This is a physical alteration that remains in place until the surface is altered again (the road is repaved, the floor repaired, etc.), and the Holomog demolitionist ignores the effects of any difficult terrain he creates in this way.</p>

					<p>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
					<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Holomog is an ancient nation built on even more ancient ruins. Its renowned civil engineers develop skills that allow them to take full advantage of their environments.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon. Mixing gumption and learnedness into a personal alchemy of daring, investigators are full of surprises. Observing the world around them, they gain valuable knowledge about the situation they&#146;re in, process that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut to the quick of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators are always evaluating situations they encounter, sizing up potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers, all while using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to find solutions to the most perplexing problems.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Investigators live to solve mysteries and find inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as advisors and support for their adventuring parties, but can take center stage when knowledge and cunning are needed. No slouches in battle, they know how to make surprise attacks and use inspiration to bring those attacks home.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Alchemist and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Investigators are proficient with simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, short sword, and sword caneUE. They are proficient in light armors, but not shields.</p>
			<p><b>Alchemy (Su): </b>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
			<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
			<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
			<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
			<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
			<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
			<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
			<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
			<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>An investigator adds 1/2 his level to Perception skill checks made to locate traps and to Disable Device checks (minimum 1). An investigator can use Disable Device to disarm magical traps.</p>
			<p><b>Structural Insight (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a Holomog demolitionist gains an insight bonus equal to his investigator level on Acrobatics checks to move through difficult terrain. At 5th level, when attempting to damage objects and structures, he ignores the first 5 points of hardness. At 8th level, the Holomog demolitionist gains a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls when attempting to sunder an item. At 11th level, he can attempt a sunder combat maneuver check against a wall no more than 5 feet thick. If the damage from the sunder combat maneuver exceeds the wall&#146;s hardness, the Holomog demolitionist creates a 5-foot opening in the wall, through which a Medium creature can easily pass.</p>
			<p><b>Structural Knowledge (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a Holomog demolitionist gains Improved Sunder as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites.</p>
			<p><b>Ricochet (Ex): </b>At 3rd level as a standard action, the Holomog demolitionist can attack an adjacent wall or object with a melee weapon. On a hit, he creates a 15-foot-cone of rock shards or splinters that deals 2d6 points of damage to targets in the area of effect. A target can attempt a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half the Holomog demolitionist&#146;s level + his Intelligence modifier) to reduce this damage by half. At 9th level, the damage increases to 4d6, and the investigator can create this effect with a ranged weapon by targeting a wall or object within 30 feet.</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talent (Ex or Su): </b>A Holomog demolitionist&#146;s studied strike damage increases every 4 levels, rather than every 2 (to 2d6 at 8th, 3d6 at 12th, 4d6 at 16th, and 5d6 at 20th level).</p>
			<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can only be selected once.</p>
			<p>Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an investigator&#146;s studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p>See the Investigator Talents section for a full list of Talents from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Keen Recollection: </b>At 3rd level, an investigator can attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Trap Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, an investigator gains an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps, granting him a +1 bonus on Ref lex saving throws to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by traps. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1 (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).</p>
			<p><b>Studied Combat (Ex): </b>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Strike (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a free action, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage. TA Holomog demolitionist&#146;s studied strike damage increases every 4 levels, rather than every 2 (to 2d6 at 8th, 3d6 at 12th, 4d6 at 16th, and 5d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.</p>
			<p>If the investigator&#146;s attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to make an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual &#150;4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.</p>
			<p>The investigator must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. An investigator cannot use studied strike against a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Alchemy (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can create alchemical items with astounding speed. It takes an investigator half the normal amount of time to create alchemical items. He can also apply poison to a weapon as a move action instead of a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>Battlefield Preparation (Ex): </b>At 6th level, the investigator can create 10 feet of difficult terrain by spending a full-round action to analyze and manipulate his surroundings. This terrain can be in any shape designated by the investigator, but at least 1 square must be adjacent to his position. For every 4 levels he has beyond 6th, the investigator can create an additional 10 feet of difficult terrain, to a maximum of 40 feet at 18th level. This is a physical alteration that remains in place until the surface is altered again (the road is repaved, the floor repaired, etc.), and the Holomog demolitionist ignores the effects of any difficult terrain he creates in this way.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, the Holomog demolitionist can use this ability to create clouds of dust and rubble that create concealment rather than difficult terrain in the same area. This concealment lasts 1d4 rounds plus 1 round for every 4 investigator levels, and the Holomog demolitionist is affected by the concealment as normal.</p>
			<p>At 14th level, the difficult terrain the Holomog demolitionist creates provides cover for himself and his allies.</p>
			<p><b>True Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an investigator can use inspiration on all skill checks&#151;even ones he isn&#146;t trained in&#151;and all ability checks without spending inspiration.</p>
			<p>In addition, whenever he expends inspiration on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can affect this. If using the amazing inspiration investigator talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If using this with empathy, tenacious inspiration, underworld inspiration, or a similar talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the higher of the two results.</p>

				<name type="string">Alchemy</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
					<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
					<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
					<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
					<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
					<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
					<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
					<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>

				<name type="string">Inspiration</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
					<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
					<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>

				<name type="string">Psychedelic Perception</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>In addition to magical extracts, a hallucinist learns to swiftly mix various psychoactive substances, using a fraction of his own power to create a magical hallucinogen that he can imbibe to grant himself powers of psychedelic perception. A hallucinogen follows all the normal rules and restrictions for an alchemist&#146;s mutagen as if they were the same substance, just as a cognatogen does.</p>
					<p>At 1st level, the effects of a hallucinogen last for 1 minute per investigator level, and the hallucinogen grants low-light vision and a +2 insight bonus on Perception checks, but imposes a &#150;2 penalty to his Dexterity. At 3rd level, the duration increases to 10 minutes per the hallucinist&#146;s investigator level and the insight bonus on Perception checks increases to +4. At 7th level, the hallucinogen also grants see invisibility and darkvision 60 feet (or if the hallucinist drinking it already has darkvision, it increases the range of the darkvision by 30 feet) and the Perception bonus increases to +6. At 11th level, the hallucinogen also grants aura sightACG and the Perception bonus increases to +8. At 15th level, the hallucinogen also grants blindsense 60 feet and the Perception bonus increases to +10.</p>
					<p>This ability replaces trapfinding, the trap sense gained at 3rd level, and the investigator talents gained at 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th levels.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 2nd level, a hallucinist has a deep understanding and appreciation of drugs. If the hallucinist spends 1 minute physically examining a drug, he can attempt a Knowledge (nature) check to identify any natural drug or a Knowledge (arcana) check to identify any magical drug (DC = the drug&#146;s addiction saving throw DC). Once he identifies a drug, he can spend 1 minute and attempt a Craft (alchemy) check (DC = the drug&#146;s addiction saving throw DC) to neutralize 1 dose of the drug. Success renders the dose harmless. The hallucinist has no chance of accidentally drugging herself when examining or attempting to neutralize a drug.</p>

At 11th level, a hallucinist becomes completely immune to drug addiction, but he can choose to lower this immunity for any particular drug. If he becomes addicted to a drug, he must fully recover from the addiction before he can resume his immunity to addiction to that drug.</p>

					<p>At 6th level and every 3 investigator levels thereafter, the expanded mind of a hallucinist is able to maintain his studied combat bonuses against an additional target at the same time. In order to do so, the hallucinist must be using his psychedelic perception ability and must expend one use of inspiration in order to designate each target beyond the first target (this cost stacks with the use of inspiration required to designate a target more than once per 24 hours). He still needs to take a move action for each target, designating them one at a time. The hallucinist can discard this connection to a target of studied combat as a free action, allowing him to study another target in its place.</p>
					<p>This ability alters studied combat and replaces all remaining trap sense.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level, a hallucinist under the effects of his hallucinogen can share and manipulate his hallucinatory revelations. By expending 10 minutes of the duration of his hallucinogen or one use of inspiration, he can create an effect similar to minor image or oneiric horror. At 5th level, he can create an effect similar to synesthesia.</p>
					<p>Any of the effects remain only while the hallucinist concentrates upon it, for up to 1 round per hallucinist&#146;s investigator level, but otherwise function as the spell. The DC of saving throws against these effects is equal to 10 + 1/2 the hallucinist&#146;s investigator level + his modifier. At 9th level, a hallucinist can expend 10 minutes of the duration of the hallucinogen or one use of inspiration to use aura alteration on one creature or object (unlike the other three abilities, this does not require concentration).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A hallucinist imbibes magical drugs to expand his mind into the psychedelic world, extending his awareness to things he could not normally perceive. While a hallucinist&#146;s body sways oddly under the effects of his hallucinogen, it grants him strange insights that reveal things to him that others can&#146;t see. Hallucinists know that others can&#146;t function with these expanded senses, and they use that fact to repurpose their hallucinations as distractions or assaults against their enemies.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon. Mixing gumption and learnedness into a personal alchemy of daring, investigators are full of surprises. Observing the world around them, they gain valuable knowledge about the situation they&#146;re in, process that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut to the quick of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators are always evaluating situations they encounter, sizing up potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers, all while using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to find solutions to the most perplexing problems.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Investigators live to solve mysteries and find inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as advisors and support for their adventuring parties, but can take center stage when knowledge and cunning are needed. No slouches in battle, they know how to make surprise attacks and use inspiration to bring those attacks home.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Alchemist and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Investigator's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Investigators are proficient with simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, short sword, and sword caneUE. They are proficient in light armors, but not shields.</p>
			<p><b>Alchemy (Su): </b>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
			<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
			<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
			<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
			<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
			<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
			<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
			<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
			<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>An investigator adds 1/2 his level to Perception skill checks made to locate traps and to Disable Device checks (minimum 1). An investigator can use Disable Device to disarm magical traps.</p>
			<p><b>Drug Lore (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hallucinist has a deep understanding and appreciation of drugs. If the hallucinist spends 1 minute physically examining a drug, he can attempt a Knowledge (nature) check to identify any natural drug or a Knowledge (arcana) check to identify any magical drug (DC = the drug&#146;s addiction saving throw DC). Once he identifies a drug, he can spend 1 minute and attempt a Craft (alchemy) check (DC = the drug&#146;s addiction saving throw DC) to neutralize 1 dose of the drug. Success renders the dose harmless. The hallucinist has no chance of accidentally drugging herself when examining or attempting to neutralize a drug.</p>
			<p><b>Drug Resistance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hallucinist gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against drug addiction. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level, and to +6 at 8th level. At 11th level, a hallucinist becomes completely immune to drug addiction, but he can choose to lower this immunity for any particular drug. If he becomes addicted to a drug, he must fully recover from the addiction before he can resume his immunity to addiction to that drug.</p>
			<p><b>Psychedelic Perception (Su): </b>In addition to magical extracts, a hallucinist learns to swiftly mix various psychoactive substances, using a fraction of his own power to create a magical hallucinogen that he can imbibe to grant himself powers of psychedelic perception. A hallucinogen follows all the normal rules and restrictions for an alchemist&#146;s mutagen as if they were the same substance, just as a cognatogen does.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, the effects of a hallucinogen last for 1 minute per investigator level, and the hallucinogen grants low-light vision and a +2 insight bonus on Perception checks, but imposes a &#150;2 penalty to his Dexterity. At 3rd level, the duration increases to 10 minutes per the hallucinist&#146;s investigator level and the insight bonus on Perception checks increases to +4. At 7th level, the hallucinogen also grants see invisibility and darkvision 60 feet (or if the hallucinist drinking it already has darkvision, it increases the range of the darkvision by 30 feet) and the Perception bonus increases to +6. At 11th level, the hallucinogen also grants aura sightACG and the Perception bonus increases to +8. At 15th level, the hallucinogen also grants blindsense 60 feet and the Perception bonus increases to +10.</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talent (Ex or Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can only be selected once.</p>
			<p>Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an investigator&#146;s studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p>See the Investigator Talents section for a full list of Talents from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Shared Hallucinations (Sp): </b>At 3rd level, a hallucinist under the effects of his hallucinogen can share and manipulate his hallucinatory revelations. By expending 10 minutes of the duration of his hallucinogen or one use of inspiration, he can create an effect similar to minor image or oneiric horrorOA. At 5th level, he can create an effect similar to synesthesiaOA.</p>
			<p>Any of the effects remain only while the hallucinist concentrates upon it, for up to 1 round per hallucinist&#146;s investigator level, but otherwise function as the spell. The DC of saving throws against these effects is equal to 10 + 1/2 the hallucinist&#146;s investigator level + his modifier. At 9th level, a hallucinist can expend 10 minutes of the duration of the hallucinogen or one use of inspiration to use aura alterationOA on one creature or object (unlike the other three abilities, this does not require concentration).</p>
			<p><b>Studied Combat (Ex): </b>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Strike (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a free action, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.</p>
			<p>If the investigator&#146;s attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to make an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual &#150;4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.</p>
			<p>The investigator must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. An investigator cannot use studied strike against a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Alchemy (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can create alchemical items with astounding speed. It takes an investigator half the normal amount of time to create alchemical items. He can also apply poison to a weapon as a move action instead of a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>Simultaneous Study (Su): </b>At 6th level and every 3 investigator levels thereafter, the expanded mind of a hallucinist is able to maintain his studied combat bonuses against an additional target at the same time. In order to do so, the hallucinist must be using his psychedelic perception ability and must expend one use of inspiration in order to designate each target beyond the first target (this cost stacks with the use of inspiration required to designate a target more than once per 24 hours). He still needs to take a move action for each target, designating them one at a time. The hallucinist can discard this connection to a target of studied combat as a free action, allowing him to study another target in its place.</p>
			<p><b>True Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an investigator can use inspiration on all skill checks&#151;even ones he isn&#146;t trained in&#151;and all ability checks without spending inspiration.</p>
			<p>In addition, whenever he expends inspiration on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can affect this. If using the amazing inspiration investigator talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If using this with empathy, tenacious inspiration, underworld inspiration, or a similar talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the higher of the two results.</p>

An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>

				<name type="string">Inspiration</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
					<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
					<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Guardians of immortality are Thuvian investigators charged with hunting down those who would attempt to steal or learn for themselves the secret to creating the sun orchid elixir.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon. Mixing gumption and learnedness into a personal alchemy of daring, investigators are full of surprises. Observing the world around them, they gain valuable knowledge about the situation they&#146;re in, process that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut to the quick of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators are always evaluating situations they encounter, sizing up potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers, all while using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to find solutions to the most perplexing problems.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Investigators live to solve mysteries and find inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as advisors and support for their adventuring parties, but can take center stage when knowledge and cunning are needed. No slouches in battle, they know how to make surprise attacks and use inspiration to bring those attacks home.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Alchemist and rogue.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Investigators are proficient with simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, short sword, and sword caneUE. They are proficient in light armors, but not shields.</p>
			<p><b>Alchemy (Su): </b>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
			<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
			<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
			<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
			<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
			<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
			<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
			<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
			<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>An investigator adds 1/2 his level to Perception skill checks made to locate traps and to Disable Device checks (minimum 1). An investigator can use Disable Device to disarm magical traps.</p>
			<p><b>Desert Survivor (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a guardian of immortality is trained by the druids of Duwwor to survive the hazards of the desert. He gains Endurance as a bonus feat and does not treat sand as difficult terrain. At 5th level, he gains resist fire 10. At 8th level, he can see twice as far in sandstorms, clouds, and fog, and whenever he gains an advantage in a desert tile during a pursuit (Ultimate Intrigue 142), he gains an additional advantage.</p>
			<p><b>Guardian&#146;s Gaze (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a guardian of immortality adds 1/2 his investigator level as a bonus on Sense Motive checks.</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talent (Ex or Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can only be selected once.</p>
			<p>Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an investigator&#146;s studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p>See the Investigator Talents section for a full list of Talents from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Keen Recollection: </b>At 3rd level, an investigator can attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Trap Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, an investigator gains an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps, granting him a +1 bonus on Ref lex saving throws to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by traps. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1 (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).</p>
			<p><b>Studied Combat (Ex): </b>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Strike (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a free action, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.</p>
			<p>If the investigator&#146;s attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to make an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual &#150;4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.</p>
			<p>The investigator must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. An investigator cannot use studied strike against a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Alchemy (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can create alchemical items with astounding speed. It takes an investigator half the normal amount of time to create alchemical items. He can also apply poison to a weapon as a move action instead of a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>Liar&#146;s Familiarity (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a guardian of immortality learns Lamasaran decoy and forgery techniques to better defeat them. His inspiration applies automatically without using an action or a use of inspiration on saving throws to disbelieve illusions, Disguise skill checks, Perception checks to see through disguises, and Linguistics checks to create or detect forgeries.</p>
			<p><b>Orchid&#146;s Drop (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a guardian of immortality is entrusted with a secret solution designed by Thuvian alchemists to emulate certain aspects of the sun orchid elixir, granting him a +1 alchemical bonus on all saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Teleportation Warden (Su): </b>At 13th level, a guardian of immortality is trained by the mages of Pashow to sense the impending arrival or departure of creatures using teleportation. This ability constantly functions like trace teleport (Ultimate Intrigue 226). In addition, the guardian of immortality can use conjuration foil (Ultimate Intrigue 207) once per day as an immediate action.</p>
			<p><b>True Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an investigator can use inspiration on all skill checks&#151;even ones he isn&#146;t trained in&#151;and all ability checks without spending inspiration.</p>
			<p>In addition, whenever he expends inspiration on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can affect this. If using the amazing inspiration investigator talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If using this with empathy, tenacious inspiration, underworld inspiration, or a similar talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the higher of the two results.</p>

					<p>A gravedigger can form a psychic bond with a skull or bone that she has personally exhumed or recovered from a burial site, using it as an occultist necromancy implement (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 47) and gaining its base focus power. The gravedigger cannot invest mental focus into the implement and thus doesn&#146;t receive any resonant powers. However, once per day she can expend one use of inspiration to use any focus power she knows that has a cost of 1 point of mental focus (Occult Adventures 47). She can do this an additional time each day at 3rd level and every 3 investigator levels thereafter. To activate a focus power that costs more than 1 point of mental focus, the gravedigger can expend that number of daily uses of this ability (as well as uses of inspiration) at the same time. In addition, any number of times per day, she can expend 1 use of inspiration to use grave wordsOA as spell-like ability.</p>

					<p>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
					<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Gravediggers pursue long buried mysteries, figuratively and literally digging up the truth and finding answers to secrets only moldering corpses and dry bones can tell.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon. Mixing gumption and learnedness into a personal alchemy of daring, investigators are full of surprises. Observing the world around them, they gain valuable knowledge about the situation they&#146;re in, process that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut to the quick of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators are always evaluating situations they encounter, sizing up potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers, all while using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to find solutions to the most perplexing problems.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Investigators live to solve mysteries and find inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as advisors and support for their adventuring parties, but can take center stage when knowledge and cunning are needed. No slouches in battle, they know how to make surprise attacks and use inspiration to bring those attacks home.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Alchemist and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Investigator's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A gravedigger is proficient with simple weapons and scythes, and can fight with gravediggers&#146; tools such as a shovel or lantern as if she had the Catch Off-Guard feat. A gravedigger is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Alchemy (Su): </b>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
			<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
			<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
			<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
			<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
			<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
			<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>
			<p><b>Grave Magic (Sp): </b>A gravedigger can sacrifice unused extract slots of the level given below or higher to use the following spells as spelllike abilities, using her investigator level as her caster level and her Intelligence to determine DCs: 1st&#151;expeditious excavationAPG; 2nd&#151;calm spiritOA; 3rd&#151;speak with dead; 4th&#151; rest eternalAPG; 5th&#151;call spiritOA; 6th&#151;undeath to death.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
			<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
			<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Limited Alchemy: </b>A gravedigger prepares and uses extracts as an investigator but gains no other benefits of the alchemy ability. This also means that a gravedigger can&#146;t take the alchemist discovery investigator talent or any discovery that affects or involves alchemy.</p>
			<p><b>Relic Focus (Su): </b>A gravedigger can form a psychic bond with a skull or bone that she has personally exhumed or recovered from a burial site, using it as an occultist necromancy implement (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 47) and gaining its base focus power. The gravedigger cannot invest mental focus into the implement and thus doesn&#146;t receive any resonant powers. However, once per day she can expend one use of inspiration to use any focus power she knows that has a cost of 1 point of mental focus (Occult Adventures 47). She can do this an additional time each day at 3rd level and every 3 investigator levels thereafter. To activate a focus power that costs more than 1 point of mental focus, the gravedigger can expend that number of daily uses of this ability (as well as uses of inspiration) at the same time. In addition, any number of times per day, she can expend 1 use of inspiration to use grave wordsOA as spell-like ability.</p>
			<p><b>Deny Death (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a gravedigger gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against death effects and energy drain. This increases to +4 at 5th level, to +6 at 8th level, and to +8 at 11th level.</p>
			<p><b>Read the Bones (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a gravedigger can perform object reading as an occultist (Occult Adventures 48), but only on corpses, bones, and other physical remains.</p>
			<p><b>Focus Talent (Su): </b>A gravedigger can select a focus power for one of her implements as per an occultist of her investigator level in place of an investigator talent.</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talent (Ex or Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can only be selected once.</p>
			<p>Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an investigator&#146;s studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p>See the Investigator Talents section for a full list of Talents from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Keen Recollection: </b>At 3rd level, an investigator can attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Trap Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, an investigator gains an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps, granting him a +1 bonus on Ref lex saving throws to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by traps. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1 (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).</p>
			<p><b>Studied Combat (Ex): </b>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Strike (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a free action, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.</p>
			<p>If the investigator&#146;s attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to make an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual &#150;4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.</p>
			<p>The investigator must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. An investigator cannot use studied strike against a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Grave Lamp (Su): </b>At 4th level, a gravedigger can form a psychic bond with a lantern, using it as a conjuration implement in much the same way as she uses her relic focus as a necromancy implement. She can expend inspiration to fuel her grave lamp&#146;s focus powers the same number of times each day as she can for her relic focus (for example, a 6th-level gravedigger with 6 points of inspiration could expend up to three uses of inspiration as mental focus for her relic focus and up to three uses of inspiration as mental focus for her grave lamp).</p>
			<p><b>True Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an investigator can use inspiration on all skill checks&#151;even ones he isn&#146;t trained in&#151;and all ability checks without spending inspiration.</p>
			<p>In addition, whenever he expends inspiration on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can affect this. If using the amazing inspiration investigator talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If using this with empathy, tenacious inspiration, underworld inspiration, or a similar talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the higher of the two results.</p>

If the investigator spends 1 minute physically examining the poison, he can attempt a Knowledge (nature) check to identify any natural poison or Knowledge (arcana) check to identify any magical poison (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC). Lastly, once a poison is identified, he can spend 1 minute and attempt a Craft (alchemy) check (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC) to neutralize 1 dose of the poison. Success renders the dose harmless. The investigator has no chance of accidentally poisoning himself when examining or attempting to neutralize a poison.</p>

If the blood is in its original setting, and the forensic physician exceeds the DC by 5 or more, he can study the blood to determine a rough estimate of when the blood was shed, and he can study the bloodstain patterns to get an approximate idea of how the creatures involved were positioned and moving.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A forensic physician specializes in analyzing medical details in order to solve crimes and uncover evidence. Whether it is a disease, blood work, a poison, or bones, the forensic physician&#146;s medical expertise allows him great insight into his cases, much to the chagrin of criminals who seek to cover up the nature of their crimes, even those with magical methods at their disposal.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon. Mixing gumption and learnedness into a personal alchemy of daring, investigators are full of surprises. Observing the world around them, they gain valuable knowledge about the situation they&#146;re in, process that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut to the quick of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators are always evaluating situations they encounter, sizing up potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers, all while using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to find solutions to the most perplexing problems.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Investigators live to solve mysteries and find inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as advisors and support for their adventuring parties, but can take center stage when knowledge and cunning are needed. No slouches in battle, they know how to make surprise attacks and use inspiration to bring those attacks home.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Alchemist and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Investigator's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Investigators are proficient with simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, short sword, and sword caneUE. They are proficient in light armors, but not shields.</p>
			<p><b>Alchemy (Su): </b>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
			<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
			<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
			<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
			<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
			<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
			<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
			<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
			<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Lore (Ex): </b>An investigator has a deep understanding and appreciation for poisons. At 2nd level, he cannot accidentally poison himself when applying poison to a weapon. If the investigator spends 1 minute physically examining the poison, he can attempt a Knowledge (nature) check to identify any natural poison or Knowledge (arcana) check to identify any magical poison (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC). Lastly, once a poison is identified, he can spend 1 minute and attempt a Craft (alchemy) check (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC) to neutralize 1 dose of the poison. Success renders the dose harmless. The investigator has no chance of accidentally poisoning himself when examining or attempting to neutralize a poison.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Resistance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, an investigator gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against poison. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level, and to +6 at 8th level. At 11th level, the investigator becomes completely immune to poison.</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talent (Ex or Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can only be selected once.</p>
			<p>Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an investigator&#146;s studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p>See the Investigator Talents section for a full list of Talents from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Disease Lore (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a forensic physician can use Heal to identify a disease after only 1 minute of examining the symptoms (DC = the disease&#146;s saving throw DC), and he can spend 1 minute and attempt a Heal check at the same DC to disinfect an infected object or corpse. At 3rd level, he receives a +2 bonus on saving throws against diseases. This bonus increases by 2 at 6th level and every 3 investigator levels thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Keen Recollection: </b>At 3rd level, an investigator can attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Combat (Ex): </b>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Strike (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a free action, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.</p>
			<p>If the investigator&#146;s attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to make an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual &#150;4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.</p>
			<p>The investigator must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. An investigator cannot use studied strike against a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Alchemy (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can create alchemical items with astounding speed. It takes an investigator half the normal amount of time to create alchemical items. He can also apply poison to a weapon as a move action instead of a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>Blood Lore (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a forensic physician can study a sample of blood and learn about its origins by attempting a Heal check with a DC of 20 for a creature very familiar to the forensic physician (generally common PC races for a PC forensic physician), 25 if the creature is somewhat familiar to the forensic physician (typically a commonly known monster, but not the subject of many investigations), and 30 or more for rarer creatures. This allows the forensic physician to identify the race of creature that spilled the blood, and the creature&#146;s age and gender (if any).</p>
			<p>If the forensic physician succeeds at the Heal check but might not have heard of the creature&#146;s race before, he can attempt an automatic Knowledge check to see if he knows about the creature. If he succeeds, he identifies the blood (and gains all other benefits of the Knowledge check); otherwise, he knows that he succeeded at the Heal check but the blood is not from a creature he recognizes. If the blood is in its original setting, and the forensic physician exceeds the DC by 5 or more, he can study the blood to determine a rough estimate of when the blood was shed, and he can study the bloodstain patterns to get an approximate idea of how the creatures involved were positioned and moving.</p>
			<p><b>True Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an investigator can use inspiration on all skill checks&#151;even ones he isn&#146;t trained in&#151;and all ability checks without spending inspiration.</p>
			<p>In addition, whenever he expends inspiration on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can affect this. If using the amazing inspiration investigator talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If using this with empathy, tenacious inspiration, underworld inspiration, or a similar talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the higher of the two results.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
					<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
					<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
					<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
					<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
					<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
					<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
					<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>

				<name type="string">Inspiration</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
					<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
					<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>

				<name type="string">Custom Mechanism</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>An engineer can create a mechanism, a small device that assists with the execution of an activity. Creating a mechanism requires 1 minute of time and expends 1 use from the engineer&#146;s inspiration pool. An engineer chooses a skill to associate with the mechanism when he creates it. As an immediate action, a mechanism can be activated to grant the engineer&#146;s inspiration die on a check of the associated skill. An engineer can create a mechanism that affects attack rolls or saving throws, but she expends 2 uses from her inspiration pool to do so. Any creature can use a mechanism, but a creature can have only 1 mechanism at a time, as multiple mechanisms interfere with each other while in close proximity. A mechanism remains active for a number of minutes equal to the engineer&#146;s Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). At 5th level, an engineer&#146;s mechanisms remain active for a number of minutes equal to the engineer&#146;s level. At 11th level, an engineer&#146;s mechanisms remain active for a number of hours equal to the engineer&#146;s level.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A number of investigators use their vast knowledge to build machines that replicate the intricacies of the world. These investigators create devices to enhance the minds and bodies of their allies and themselves.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon. Mixing gumption and learnedness into a personal alchemy of daring, investigators are full of surprises. Observing the world around them, they gain valuable knowledge about the situation they&#146;re in, process that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut to the quick of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators are always evaluating situations they encounter, sizing up potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers, all while using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to find solutions to the most perplexing problems.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Investigators live to solve mysteries and find inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as advisors and support for their adventuring parties, but can take center stage when knowledge and cunning are needed. No slouches in battle, they know how to make surprise attacks and use inspiration to bring those attacks home.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Alchemist and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Investigator's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Investigators are proficient with simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, short sword, and sword caneUE. They are proficient in light armors, but not shields.</p>
			<p><b>Alchemy (Su): </b>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
			<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
			<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
			<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
			<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
			<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
			<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>
			<p><b>Custom Mechanism (Ex): </b>An engineer can create a mechanism, a small device that assists with the execution of an activity. Creating a mechanism requires 1 minute of time and expends 1 use from the engineer&#146;s inspiration pool. An engineer chooses a skill to associate with the mechanism when he creates it. As an immediate action, a mechanism can be activated to grant the engineer&#146;s inspiration die on a check of the associated skill. An engineer can create a mechanism that affects attack rolls or saving throws, but she expends 2 uses from her inspiration pool to do so. Any creature can use a mechanism, but a creature can have only 1 mechanism at a time, as multiple mechanisms interfere with each other while in close proximity. A mechanism remains active for a number of minutes equal to the engineer&#146;s Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). At 5th level, an engineer&#146;s mechanisms remain active for a number of minutes equal to the engineer&#146;s level. At 11th level, an engineer&#146;s mechanisms remain active for a number of hours equal to the engineer&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
			<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
			<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talent (Ex or Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can only be selected once.</p>
			<p>Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an investigator&#146;s studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p>See the Investigator Talents section for a full list of Talents from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Keen Recollection: </b>At 3rd level, an investigator can attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Mechanical Understanding (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, an engineer gains a deeper understanding of constructs and machines. He gains a +1 bonus on Knowledge (arcana) checks to identify constructs and a +1 bonus on Knowledge (engineering) checks. This bonus increases by 1 at 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Combat (Ex): </b>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Strike (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a free action, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.</p>
			<p>If the investigator&#146;s attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to make an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual &#150;4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.</p>
			<p>The investigator must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. An investigator cannot use studied strike against a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Alchemy (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can create alchemical items with astounding speed. It takes an investigator half the normal amount of time to create alchemical items. He can also apply poison to a weapon as a move action instead of a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>True Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an investigator can use inspiration on all skill checks&#151;even ones he isn&#146;t trained in&#151;and all ability checks without spending inspiration.</p>
			<p>In addition, whenever he expends inspiration on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can affect this. If using the amazing inspiration investigator talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If using this with empathy, tenacious inspiration, underworld inspiration, or a similar talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the higher of the two results.</p>

At 2nd level, an empiricist uses his Intelligence modif ier instead of the skill&#146;s typical ability for all Disable Device, Perception, Sense Motive, and Use Magic Device checks. He can also use his Intelligence modifier instead of Charisma on any Diplomacy checks made to gather information. This ability replaces poison lore and poison resistance.</p>

					<p>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
					<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Champions of deductive reasoning and logical insight, empiricists put their faith in facts, data, confirmed observations, and consistently repeatable experiments&#151;these things are their currency of truth.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon. Mixing gumption and learnedness into a personal alchemy of daring, investigators are full of surprises. Observing the world around them, they gain valuable knowledge about the situation they&#146;re in, process that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut to the quick of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators are always evaluating situations they encounter, sizing up potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers, all while using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to find solutions to the most perplexing problems.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Investigators live to solve mysteries and find inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as advisors and support for their adventuring parties, but can take center stage when knowledge and cunning are needed. No slouches in battle, they know how to make surprise attacks and use inspiration to bring those attacks home.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Alchemist and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Investigator's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Investigators are proficient with simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, short sword, and sword caneUE. They are proficient in light armors, but not shields.</p>
			<p><b>Alchemy (Su): </b>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
			<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
			<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
			<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
			<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
			<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
			<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
			<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
			<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>An investigator adds 1/2 his level to Perception skill checks made to locate traps and to Disable Device checks (minimum 1). An investigator can use Disable Device to disarm magical traps.</p>
			<p><b>Ceaseless Observation (Ex): </b>An empiricist&#146;s ability to notice the minutiae of almost everything that happens around him allows him to make shrewd and insightful calculations about people and even inanimate objects. At 2nd level, an empiricist uses his Intelligence modif ier instead of the skill&#146;s typical ability for all Disable Device, Perception, Sense Motive, and Use Magic Device checks. He can also use his Intelligence modifier instead of Charisma on any Diplomacy checks made to gather information. This ability replaces poison lore and poison resistance.</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talent (Ex or Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can only be selected once.</p>
			<p>Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an investigator&#146;s studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p>See the Investigator Talents section for a full list of Talents from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Keen Recollection: </b>At 3rd level, an investigator can attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Trap Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, an investigator gains an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps, granting him a +1 bonus on Ref lex saving throws to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by traps. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1 (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).</p>
			<p><b>Studied Combat (Ex): </b>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Strike (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a free action, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.</p>
			<p>If the investigator&#146;s attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to make an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual &#150;4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.</p>
			<p>The investigator must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. An investigator cannot use studied strike against a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Unfailing Logic (Ex): </b>An empiricist&#146;s grasp of facts and data teaches him to anchor himself in reality, granting resistance to even the most potent illusions. At 4th level, an empiricist gains a +2 insight bonus on all Will saving throws against illusion spells or spell-like abilities that allow a save to disbelieve their effects. In addition he can spend one point from his inspiration pool as an immediate action to use his Intelligence bonus instead of her Wisdom bonus on all such saves for one round.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the empiricist&#146;s insight bonus increases to +4. At 16th level, he gains immunity to all illusion spells and spell-like abilities that allow a save to disbelieve the effects. This ability replaces swift alchemy.</p>
			<p><b>Master Intellect (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an empiricist&#146;s powers of reason and deduction become almost superhuman, and he is able to use them in nearly all aspects of life. At 20th level, an empiricist can use inspiration on all skills (even ones he is not trained in) and all ability checks (including initiative checks) without spending inspiration. This ability replaces true inspiration.</p>

					<p>An investigator has a deep understanding and appreciation for poisons. At 2nd level, he cannot accidentally poison himself when applying poison to a weapon.

Lastly, once a poison is identified, he can spend 1 minute and attempt a Craft (alchemy) check (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC) to neutralize 1 dose of the poison. Success renders the dose harmless. The investigator has no chance of accidentally poisoning himself when examining or attempting to neutralize a poison.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
					<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The dread investigator observes human behavior after the fact, honing their intuition by delving into the mysteries of death. They breach sealed tombs to recover research material rather than riches. Many join&#151;or found&#151;cults dedicated to Urgathoa, while others are simply researchers or Osirionologists who must become accustomed to undeath to pursue their work.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon. Mixing gumption and learnedness into a personal alchemy of daring, investigators are full of surprises. Observing the world around them, they gain valuable knowledge about the situation they&#146;re in, process that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut to the quick of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators are always evaluating situations they encounter, sizing up potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers, all while using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to find solutions to the most perplexing problems.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Investigators live to solve mysteries and find inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as advisors and support for their adventuring parties, but can take center stage when knowledge and cunning are needed. No slouches in battle, they know how to make surprise attacks and use inspiration to bring those attacks home.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Alchemist and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Investigator's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Investigators are proficient with simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, short sword, and sword caneUE. They are proficient in light armors, but not shields.</p>
			<p><b>Alchemy (Su): </b>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
			<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
			<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
			<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
			<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
			<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
			<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
			<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
			<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>An investigator adds 1/2 his level to Perception skill checks made to locate traps and to Disable Device checks (minimum 1). An investigator can use Disable Device to disarm magical traps.</p>
			<p><b>Embalming Fluids (Ex): </b>A dread investigator adds the following spells to his class list of extracts: 1st&#151;hide from undead, sanctify corpseUM; 2nd&#151;gentle repose, lesser animate deadUM; 3rd&#151;animate dead, speak with dead; 4th&#151;rest eternalAPG. A dread investigator can use these extracts to affect dead bodies as if using the infusion discovery to affect another creature. This ability replaces poison lore.</p>
			<p><b>Negative Energy Resistance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a dread investigator gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against death effects, energy drain, and negative energy. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level and +6 at 8th level. At 11th level, effects created by undead that inflict ability drain, ability damage, or energy drain have only half their normal effect on a dread investigator (minimum 1 point of ability damage or ability drain, or 1 negative level). This ability replaces poison resistance and immunity.</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talent (Ex or Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can only be selected once.</p>
			<p>Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an investigator&#146;s studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p>See the Investigator Talents section for a full list of Talents from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Keen Recollection: </b>At 3rd level, an investigator can attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Trap Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, an investigator gains an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps, granting him a +1 bonus on Ref lex saving throws to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by traps. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1 (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).</p>
			<p><b>Delayed Inspiration: </b>A dread investigator gains inspiration at 4th level instead of 1st and gains studied combat and studied strike at 7th level instead of 4th. A dread investigator&#146;s studied strike deals 1d6 fewer points of damage than normal. This alters inspiration, studied combat, and studied strike.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Combat (Ex): </b>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Strike (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a free action, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.</p>
			<p>If the investigator&#146;s attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to make an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual &#150;4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.</p>
			<p>The investigator must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. An investigator cannot use studied strike against a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Alchemy (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can create alchemical items with astounding speed. It takes an investigator half the normal amount of time to create alchemical items. He can also apply poison to a weapon as a move action instead of a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>Reanimation Fluid (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a dread investigator adds undead anatomy IUM to his formula book, and he can share this extract with an unconscious creature as if he had the infusion discovery. If the creature is dying when it receives the infusion, it stabilizes and gains temporary hit points equal to twice the dread investigator&#146;s level. Rather than having the extract take effect immediately, the dread investigator may choose for the extract to remain latent for up to 10 minutes per level. He can trigger the extract&#146;s effect at any point by touching the creature as a standard action, and it automatically triggers if the creature using it is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points. The dread investigator can also amplify the effect of the extract, allowing it to function as undead anatomy IIUM, but this reduces the extract&#146;s duration to 1 round per level and at the end of its duration the creature using the extract is reduced to &#150;1 hit points.</p>
			<p>At 13th level, a dread investigator adds undead anatomy II to his formula book, and at 19th level undead anatomy IIIUM, which he can use in the same way, including amplifying the effect of the extract to the next-higher-level undead anatomy spell. This ability replaces the investigator talents gained at 7th, 13th, and 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>True Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an investigator can use inspiration on all skill checks&#151;even ones he isn&#146;t trained in&#151;and all ability checks without spending inspiration.</p>
			<p>In addition, whenever he expends inspiration on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can affect this. If using the amazing inspiration investigator talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If using this with empathy, tenacious inspiration, underworld inspiration, or a similar talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the higher of the two results.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Cult hunters seek out heretical secret societies, purging their ideological taint and banishing summoned servants.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon. Mixing gumption and learnedness into a personal alchemy of daring, investigators are full of surprises. Observing the world around them, they gain valuable knowledge about the situation they&#146;re in, process that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut to the quick of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators are always evaluating situations they encounter, sizing up potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers, all while using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to find solutions to the most perplexing problems.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Investigators live to solve mysteries and find inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as advisors and support for their adventuring parties, but can take center stage when knowledge and cunning are needed. No slouches in battle, they know how to make surprise attacks and use inspiration to bring those attacks home.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Alchemist and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Investigator's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Investigators are proficient with simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, short sword, and sword caneUE. They are proficient in light armors, but not shields.</p>
			<p><b>Alchemy (Su): </b>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
			<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
			<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
			<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
			<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
			<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
			<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
			<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
			<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Sense Madness (Ex): </b>A cult hunter adds a bonus equal to 1/2 his class level (minimum +1) on Sense Motive checks, or double that bonus to determine whether a creature suffers from natural or magical insanity.</p>
			<p><b>Purify Mind and Body (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a cult hunter gains a +1 bonus on saving throws against compulsions and poisons. This bonus increases to +2 at 5th level and +3 at 8th level. At 11th level, a cult hunter who fails a saving throw against a compulsion or poison can expend 1 use of his inspiration to reroll the saving throw (and his inspiration die, if added to the save). He must accept the result of this second roll, even if it is worse.</p>
			<p><b>Student of the Beyond (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a cult hunter gains a bonus equal to 1/2 his class level on Knowledge and Spellcraft checks made to recognize any calling and summoning spells, portals, rifts, and planar travel.</p>
			<p><b>Ambush Defense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a cult hunter gains a +1 insight bonus during a surprise round triggered by his enemies on Reflex saves and to his AC. This bonus increases by 1 for every 3 investigator levels beyond 3rd.</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talent (Ex or Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can only be selected once.</p>
			<p>Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an investigator&#146;s studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p>See the Investigator Talents section for a full list of Talents from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Keen Recollection: </b>At 3rd level, an investigator can attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Cult Combat (Ex): </b>A cult hunter&#146;s bonuses on attack and damage rolls when using studied combat increase by 1 against followers of the cult he chose with his cultic study ability and decrease by 1 against other targets.</p>
			<p><b>Cult Strike (Ex): </b>A cult hunter&#146;s studied strike uses d8s for the bonus damage against targets that belong to the cult he&#146;s studied. Against other targets, his studied strike uses d4s for the bonus damage.</p>
			<p><b>Cultic Study (Ex): </b>A cult hunter can spend 8 hours studying a specific deity or religion to gain a +1 bonus on Bluff, Intimidate, Knowledge, Perception, and Sense Motive checks against followers of that deity or religion and against extraplanar creatures. These bonuses increase by 1 for every 4 investigator levels beyond 4th. If he studies a new deity or religion, the bonuses replace the former bonuses.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Strike (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a free action, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.</p>
			<p>If the investigator&#146;s attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to make an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual &#150;4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.</p>
			<p>The investigator must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. An investigator cannot use studied strike against a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Alchemy (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can create alchemical items with astounding speed. It takes an investigator half the normal amount of time to create alchemical items. He can also apply poison to a weapon as a move action instead of a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>Summoning Sense (Su): </b>At 7th level, a cult hunter gains the benefits of uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge against summoned creatures.</p>
			<p><b>Extraplanar Expulsion (Sp): </b>At 13th level, a cult hunter can grant himself the ability to use dispel chaos, dispel evil, dispel good, or dispel law as a spell-like ability (using his investigator level as his caster level and his Intelligence to determine the DCs) by sacrificing an unused 5th- or 6th-level extract for the day. He is able to use this ability as many times as he likes, but only so long as he continues to have unused 5thor 6th-level extract slots to expend.</p>
			<p><b>True Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an investigator can use inspiration on all skill checks&#151;even ones he isn&#146;t trained in&#151;and all ability checks without spending inspiration.</p>
			<p>In addition, whenever he expends inspiration on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can affect this. If using the amazing inspiration investigator talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If using this with empathy, tenacious inspiration, underworld inspiration, or a similar talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the higher of the two results.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
					<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
					<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
					<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
					<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
					<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
					<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
					<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
					<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
					<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>

			<p><i>Cryptid scholars research monsters that lurk secretly at the edge of civilization, developing a deep expertise regarding their anatomy, habits, and ecology. Most cryptid scholars are affiliated with the University of Lepidstadt, but spend more time away performing field work than they do consorting with their fellow scholars (many of whom find a cryptid scholar&#146;s peculiar specialty suspicious at best). Although competent as lone monster hunters, cryptid scholars excel when they have associates with whom to share their insights.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon. Mixing gumption and learnedness into a personal alchemy of daring, investigators are full of surprises. Observing the world around them, they gain valuable knowledge about the situation they&#146;re in, process that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut to the quick of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators are always evaluating situations they encounter, sizing up potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers, all while using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to find solutions to the most perplexing problems.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Investigators live to solve mysteries and find inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as advisors and support for their adventuring parties, but can take center stage when knowledge and cunning are needed. No slouches in battle, they know how to make surprise attacks and use inspiration to bring those attacks home.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Alchemist and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Investigators are proficient with simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, short sword, and sword caneUE. They are proficient in light armors, but not shields.</p>
			<p><b>Alchemy (Su): </b>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
			<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
			<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
			<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
			<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
			<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
			<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
			<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
			<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>An investigator adds 1/2 his level to Perception skill checks made to locate traps and to Disable Device checks (minimum 1). An investigator can use Disable Device to disarm magical traps.</p>
			<p><b>Intuitive Monster Lore (Ex): </b>A cryptid scholar adds his Wisdom modifier on Knowledge skill checks in addition to his Intelligence modifier when attempting skill checks to identify the abilities and weaknesses of creatures. At 5th level, a cryptid scholar can take 10 on such checks, even when threatened or distracted.</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talent (Ex or Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can only be selected once.</p>
			<p>Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an investigator&#146;s studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p>See the Investigator Talents section for a full list of Talents from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Keen Recollection: </b>At 3rd level, an investigator can attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Trap Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, an investigator gains an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps, granting him a +1 bonus on Ref lex saving throws to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by traps. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1 (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).</p>
			<p><b>Knowledgeable Strike (Ex): </b>At 4th level, the cryptid scholar can direct allies to exploit a monster&#146;s weaknesses. If the cryptid scholar ends his opportune advice early as a move action, each ally within 30 feet who can hear the cryptid scholar deals additional damage on its next successful unarmed, natural, or weapon attack against that specific kind of monster within 1 round. The additional damage is 1d6 at 4th level and increases by 1d6 for every 4 investigator levels thereafter (to a maximum of 5d6 at 20th level). The damage of knowledgeable strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to knowledgeable strike. Ranged attacks gain this additional damage only against a target within 30 feet. The ally must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. Knowledgeable strike cannot be used against a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Opportune Advice (Ex): </b>At 4th level, when the cryptid scholar succeeds at a Knowledge check to identify a monster&#146;s special powers or vulnerabilities, he can take a move action to share his insights with his allies. Allies within 30 feet who can hear the cryptid scholar gain a +1 insight bonus to their ACs and on saving throws against extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities used by creatures of the same type and all the same subtypes as the monster identified. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the cryptid scholar&#146;s Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) or until he uses knowledgeable strike (see below), whichever comes first. This bonus increases by 1 at 8th level and every 4 investigator levels thereafter (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level). A creature cannot benefit from opportune advice regarding more than one specific kind of monster at a time.</p>
			<p>Once the cryptid scholar has used this ability to provide a bonus against a specific kind of monster, he can&#146;t grant a bonus against that same kind of monster again for 24 hours, unless he expends one use of inspiration when taking a move action to use this ability.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces studied combat, and the cryptid scholar cannot choose investigator talents that add effects to studied combat or studied strike.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Alchemy (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can create alchemical items with astounding speed. It takes an investigator half the normal amount of time to create alchemical items. He can also apply poison to a weapon as a move action instead of a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>True Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an investigator can use inspiration on all skill checks&#151;even ones he isn&#146;t trained in&#151;and all ability checks without spending inspiration.</p>
			<p>In addition, whenever he expends inspiration on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can affect this. If using the amazing inspiration investigator talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If using this with empathy, tenacious inspiration, underworld inspiration, or a similar talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the higher of the two results.</p>

					<p>An investigator has a deep understanding and appreciation for poisons. At 2nd level, he cannot accidentally poison himself when applying poison to a weapon. If the investigator spends 1 minute physically examining the poison, he can attempt a Knowledge (nature) check to identify any natural poison or Knowledge (arcana) check to identify any magical poison (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC). Lastly, once a poison is identified, he can spend 1 minute and attempt a Craft (alchemy) check (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC) to neutralize 1 dose of the poison. Success renders the dose harmless. The investigator has no chance of accidentally poisoning himself when examining or attempting to neutralize a poison.</p>

					<p>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
					<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A conspirator uses his knowledge of investigations to make sure he avoids any investigations that his rivals perform, carefully plotting acts of intrigue behind closed doors. Paranoid to a fault, a conspirator always seems to know when someone else is watching him, and he takes numerous precautions to prevent anyone from observing his most illict actions.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon. Mixing gumption and learnedness into a personal alchemy of daring, investigators are full of surprises. Observing the world around them, they gain valuable knowledge about the situation they&#146;re in, process that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut to the quick of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators are always evaluating situations they encounter, sizing up potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers, all while using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to find solutions to the most perplexing problems.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Investigators live to solve mysteries and find inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as advisors and support for their adventuring parties, but can take center stage when knowledge and cunning are needed. No slouches in battle, they know how to make surprise attacks and use inspiration to bring those attacks home.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Alchemist and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Investigator's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Investigators are proficient with simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, short sword, and sword caneUE. They are proficient in light armors, but not shields.</p>
			<p><b>Alchemy (Su): </b>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
			<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
			<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
			<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
			<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
			<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
			<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
			<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
			<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Underhanded (Ex): </b>Conspirators find their skill sets firmly aligned with the goals of the criminal underworld. At 1st level, a conspirator can use inspiration on any Bluff, Disable Device, Disguise, Intimidate, and Sleight of Hand check without expending a use of inspiration, provided he is trained in the skill, instead of on any Knowledge, Linguistics, and Spellcraft check. He can later choose to trade an investigator talent for the ability to use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, and Spellcraft check without expending a use of inspirtation, provided he is trained in the skill. A conspirator adds half his investigator level (minimum 1) on Bluff checks to appear innocent and on Disguise checks.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Lore (Ex): </b>An investigator has a deep understanding and appreciation for poisons. At 2nd level, he cannot accidentally poison himself when applying poison to a weapon. If the investigator spends 1 minute physically examining the poison, he can attempt a Knowledge (nature) check to identify any natural poison or Knowledge (arcana) check to identify any magical poison (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC). Lastly, once a poison is identified, he can spend 1 minute and attempt a Craft (alchemy) check (DC = the poison&#146;s saving throw DC) to neutralize 1 dose of the poison. Success renders the dose harmless. The investigator has no chance of accidentally poisoning himself when examining or attempting to neutralize a poison.</p>
			<p><b>Poison Resistance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, an investigator gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against poison. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level, and to +6 at 8th level. At 11th level, the investigator becomes completely immune to poison.</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talent (Ex or Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can only be selected once.</p>
			<p>Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an investigator&#146;s studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p>See the Investigator Talents section for a full list of Talents from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Keen Recollection: </b>At 3rd level, an investigator can attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Watcher Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a conspirator is able to sense when someone else is watching him. He gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to notice scrying sensors, prying eyes, and other magical effects used to watch him, as well as on Perception checks to act on the surprise round. This bonus increases by 1 at 6th level and every 3 investigator levels thereafter.</p>
			<p>Additionally, at 7th level, if a scrying sensor is invisible, the invisibility does not increase the DC of the conspirator&#146;s Perception check to notice it, regardless of whether or not he is using an ability that allows him to see invisible things. The DC for his Perception check is equal to 20 + the spell&#146;s level (with no +20 increase to the Perception DC for a moving invisible sensor or no +40 increase for an immobile invisible sensor).</p>
			<p><b>Studied Combat (Ex): </b>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Strike (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a free action, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.</p>
			<p>If the investigator&#146;s attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to make an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual &#150;4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.</p>
			<p>The investigator must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. An investigator cannot use studied strike against a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Alchemy (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can create alchemical items with astounding speed. It takes an investigator half the normal amount of time to create alchemical items. He can also apply poison to a weapon as a move action instead of a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>True Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an investigator can use inspiration on all skill checks&#151;even ones he isn&#146;t trained in&#151;and all ability checks without spending inspiration.</p>
			<p>In addition, whenever he expends inspiration on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can affect this. If using the amazing inspiration investigator talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If using this with empathy, tenacious inspiration, underworld inspiration, or a similar talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the higher of the two results.</p>

				<level type="number">1</level>
				<name type="string">Inattention Blindness</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a cipher can blind nearby creatures to his presence. A creature who would become aware of a cipher&#146;s presence when the cipher is within 10 feet per cipher level must succeed at a Perception check against a DC equal to 10 + the cipher&#146;s investigator level + his Intelligence modifier or the creature ignores the investigator as though it had not become aware of his presence. The cipher can spend a use of inspiration to raise the DC by 1d6. The affected creature continues to ignore the cipher until he attacks, moves out of range, directly interacts with the creature, interacts with another creature or object in a way the affected creature notices, or otherwise specifically draws attention to himself. If the cipher does none of these things, the affected creature can attempt another Perception check at the same DC for each minute the cipher remains in range.</p>
					<p>A creature that was aware of the cipher&#146;s presence prior to being in range of his inattention blinding ability is unaffected. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.</p>
					<p>A cipher can affect only one creature with inattention blindness at any given time, plus one additional creature at 5th level and every 3 investigator levels thereafter, to a maximum of seven creatures at 19th level. Once a cipher reaches that maximum, he can&#146;t affect an additional creature until he ends the effect for an already affected creature. If multiple creatures enter the range of inattention blindness simultaneously, they all must attempt Perception checks; the inattention blindness effect affects the creatures with the lowest Perception check results, in order, until it reaches the maximum number of creatures it can affect.</p>
					<p>The cipher can suppress or activate inattention blindness as a free action, and dismiss its effects on any affected creature within range as a move action.</p>
					<p>This ability replaces trapfinding, poison lore, poison resistance, poison immunity, and trap sense.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A cipher is a student of nonexistence. He trains himself to remain undetected and ignored in order to conduct his investigations without opposition or bothersome questions. By staying unseen, a cipher can follow and observe his quarry; being overlooked in a crowd suits him just fine.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon. Mixing gumption and learnedness into a personal alchemy of daring, investigators are full of surprises. Observing the world around them, they gain valuable knowledge about the situation they&#146;re in, process that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut to the quick of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators are always evaluating situations they encounter, sizing up potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers, all while using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to find solutions to the most perplexing problems.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Investigators live to solve mysteries and find inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as advisors and support for their adventuring parties, but can take center stage when knowledge and cunning are needed. No slouches in battle, they know how to make surprise attacks and use inspiration to bring those attacks home.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Alchemist and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Investigator's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Investigators are proficient with simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, short sword, and sword caneUE. They are proficient in light armors, but not shields.</p>
			<p><b>Alchemy (Su): </b>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
			<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
			<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
			<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
			<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
			<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
			<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>
			<p><b>Inattention Blindness (Su): </b>At 1st level, a cipher can blind nearby creatures to his presence. A creature who would become aware of a cipher&#146;s presence when the cipher is within 10 feet per cipher level must succeed at a Perception check against a DC equal to 10 + the cipher&#146;s investigator level + his Intelligence modifier or the creature ignores the investigator as though it had not become aware of his presence. The cipher can spend a use of inspiration to raise the DC by 1d6. The affected creature continues to ignore the cipher until he attacks, moves out of range, directly interacts with the creature, interacts with another creature or object in a way the affected creature notices, or otherwise specifically draws attention to himself. If the cipher does none of these things, the affected creature can attempt another Perception check at the same DC for each minute the cipher remains in range.</p>
			<p>A creature that was aware of the cipher&#146;s presence prior to being in range of his inattention blinding ability is unaffected. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.</p>
			<p>A cipher can affect only one creature with inattention blindness at any given time, plus one additional creature at 5th level and every 3 investigator levels thereafter, to a maximum of seven creatures at 19th level. Once a cipher reaches that maximum, he can&#146;t affect an additional creature until he ends the effect for an already affected creature. If multiple creatures enter the range of inattention blindness simultaneously, they all must attempt Perception checks; the inattention blindness effect affects the creatures with the lowest Perception check results, in order, until it reaches the maximum number of creatures it can affect.</p>
			<p>The cipher can suppress or activate inattention blindness as a free action, and dismiss its effects on any affected creature within range as a move action.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
			<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
			<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Evasive (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a cipher can avoid unusual attacks. He gains the evasion ability, and at 11th level, he gains the improved evasion ability.</p>
			<p><b>Keen Recollection: </b>At 3rd level, an investigator can attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Null Aura (Su, Sp): </b>At 4th level, a cipher becomes much harder to notice with divinations. He gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against divination spells, spell-like abilities, and effects.</p>
			<p>Attempts to locate the cipher with scrying and other spells that share the knowledge and connection rules with scrying function only if the caster has firsthand or familiar knowledge of the cipher, or has one of his body parts (not from secondhand knowledge, possession, or a likeness of the cipher).</p>
			<p>If the caster does not meet these conditions, or if the cipher succeeds at a saving throw to negate such an effect, the spell or effect reveals nothing but darkness as if the target was invalid or did not exist; unlike normal, even if she is using a spell with a single target, the caster of the divination effect does not discover that her target succeeded at a saving throw.</p>
			<p>At 9th level, a cipher benefits from constant nondetection, requiring those who wish to use divinations on him to succeed at a caster level check (DC = 15 + his investigator level).</p>
			<p><b>Studied Combat (Ex): </b>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Strike (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a free action, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.</p>
			<p>If the investigator&#146;s attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to make an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual &#150;4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.</p>
			<p>The investigator must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. An investigator cannot use studied strike against a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Tenuous Threat (Su): </b>At 5th level, a cipher&#146;s opponents tend to forget that he is a threat. The first time each day that he successfully hits an opponent who is not the target of his studied combat with a melee attack, the opponent must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the cipher&#146;s investigator level + his Intelligence modifier) or be affected by the cipher&#146;s studied strike. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Su): </b>At 7th level, a cipher can use the Stealth skill to hide even while being observed; as long as his observer is within range of his inattention blindness ability (even if it is not affected by inattention blindness), he can hide without anything to actually hide behind.</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talent (Ex or Su): </b>At 13th level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can only be selected once.</p>
			<p>Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an investigator&#146;s studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p>See the Investigator Talents section for a full list of Talents from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>True Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an investigator can use inspiration on all skill checks&#151;even ones he isn&#146;t trained in&#151;and all ability checks without spending inspiration.</p>
			<p>In addition, whenever he expends inspiration on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can affect this. If using the amazing inspiration investigator talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If using this with empathy, tenacious inspiration, underworld inspiration, or a similar talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the higher of the two results.</p>

				<name type="string">Alchemy</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
					<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
					<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
					<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
					<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
					<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
					<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
					<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>

				<name type="string">Inspiration</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
					<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
					<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 2nd level, a cartographer can expend one use of inspiration to sketch a map and take notes of his surroundings. Drawing the map takes 10 minutes. While he is within the studied area, the cartographer can use inspiration on Acrobatics, Climb, Fly, Ride, Stealth, Survival, and Swim checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he is trained in the skill. If he already has the ability to use inspiration on any of these skills without expending a use of inspiration, he gains an additional +1 bonus on checks with that skill while in the studied area.</p>
					<p>A cartographer can draw three types of maps. He cannot combine different map types in the same map, and areas within range that would belong in the other categories are excluded.</p>
					<p><i>Dungeon Map: </i>While indoors, underground, or in any other type of environment where visibility is limited by walls, the radius is 100 feet per level, and only areas that the cartographer has explored within the past 24 hours count as studied terrain. Areas explored after drawing the map do not retroactively become part of the studied terrain.</p>
					<p><i>Overland Map: </i>In natural terrain, the radius of the mapped area is equal to 1 mile per investigator level. If he is unable to see the whole area, he extrapolates and uses his knowledge of geography to fill in the blanks.</p>
					<p><i>Town Map: </i>While in an urban area or ruins, the radius is 1,000 feet per level or the entirety of the urban or ruined area, whichever is smaller.</p>
					<p>Much like alchemy, cartography requires materials, but the cost of those materials is negligible. However, knowing an area so well as to gain these benefits requires more than just paper and ink&#151;a great deal of memorization and a bit of inspiration are also required. For this reason, a cartographer can maintain these benefits in only one area at a time. The benefits remain in effect until the cartographer studies a new area or refreshes his inspiration pool.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Cartographers are eager trailblazers who explore uncharted terrain, study landmarks, and find new paths through the wilderness. They record this information meticulously so that those who follow in their footsteps can travel swiftly and safely within the studied area. Rather than studying poisons like many investigators do, cartographers use their alchemical expertise to create better inks that allow them to draw maps with incredible level of detail.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon. Mixing gumption and learnedness into a personal alchemy of daring, investigators are full of surprises. Observing the world around them, they gain valuable knowledge about the situation they&#146;re in, process that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut to the quick of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators are always evaluating situations they encounter, sizing up potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers, all while using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to find solutions to the most perplexing problems.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Investigators live to solve mysteries and find inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as advisors and support for their adventuring parties, but can take center stage when knowledge and cunning are needed. No slouches in battle, they know how to make surprise attacks and use inspiration to bring those attacks home.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Alchemist and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Investigator's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Investigators are proficient with simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, short sword, and sword caneUE. They are proficient in light armors, but not shields.</p>
			<p><b>Alchemy (Su): </b>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
			<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
			<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
			<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
			<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
			<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
			<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
			<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
			<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>An investigator adds 1/2 his level to Perception skill checks made to locate traps and to Disable Device checks (minimum 1). An investigator can use Disable Device to disarm magical traps.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Terrain (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a cartographer can expend one use of inspiration to sketch a map and take notes of his surroundings. Drawing the map takes 10 minutes. While he is within the studied area, the cartographer can use inspiration on Acrobatics, Climb, Fly, Ride, Stealth, Survival, and Swim checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he is trained in the skill. If he already has the ability to use inspiration on any of these skills without expending a use of inspiration, he gains an additional +1 bonus on checks with that skill while in the studied area.</p>
			<p>A cartographer can draw three types of maps. He cannot combine different map types in the same map, and areas within range that would belong in the other categories are excluded.</p>
			<p><i>Dungeon Map: </i>While indoors, underground, or in any other type of environment where visibility is limited by walls, the radius is 100 feet per level, and only areas that the cartographer has explored within the past 24 hours count as studied terrain. Areas explored after drawing the map do not retroactively become part of the studied terrain.</p>
			<p><i>Overland Map: </i>In natural terrain, the radius of the mapped area is equal to 1 mile per investigator level. If he is unable to see the whole area, he extrapolates and uses his knowledge of geography to fill in the blanks.</p>
			<p><i>Town Map: </i>While in an urban area or ruins, the radius is 1,000 feet per level or the entirety of the urban or ruined area, whichever is smaller.</p>
			<p>Much like alchemy, cartography requires materials, but the cost of those materials is negligible. However, knowing an area so well as to gain these benefits requires more than just paper and ink&#151;a great deal of memorization and a bit of inspiration are also required. For this reason, a cartographer can maintain these benefits in only one area at a time. The benefits remain in effect until the cartographer studies a new area or refreshes his inspiration pool.</p>
			<p><b>Geographic Lore (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a cartographer gains a deeper understanding of wilderness terrain. Whenever he is on the Material Plane, he can determine where true north is as a full-round action. Furthermore, he can create and sell maps to earn a number of gold pieces per week of dedicated work equal to half his Knowledge (geography) check result per week.</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talent (Ex or Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can only be selected once.</p>
			<p>Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an investigator&#146;s studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p>See the Investigator Talents section for a full list of Talents from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Trap Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, an investigator gains an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps, granting him a +1 bonus on Ref lex saving throws to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by traps. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1 (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).</p>
			<p><b>Studied Combat (Ex): </b>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Strike (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a free action, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.</p>
			<p>If the investigator&#146;s attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to make an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual &#150;4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.</p>
			<p>The investigator must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. An investigator cannot use studied strike against a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Travels (Ex): </b>At 4th level, while in studied terrain, a cartographer intuitively knows the easiest, shortest, and fastest way through the wilderness. For the purpose of determining overland speed, the cartographer treats any trackless terrain as though he were on a trail, and he treats any terrain with a road or trail as though it were a highway. He can extend the benefit to up to one creature per investigator level traveling with him.</p>
			<p><b>True Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an investigator can use inspiration on all skill checks&#151;even ones he isn&#146;t trained in&#151;and all ability checks without spending inspiration.</p>
			<p>In addition, whenever he expends inspiration on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can affect this. If using the amazing inspiration investigator talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If using this with empathy, tenacious inspiration, underworld inspiration, or a similar talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the higher of the two results.</p>

Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
					<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
					<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
					<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
					<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
					<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>

				<name type="string">Inspiration</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
					<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
					<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>

					<p>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training.

Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
					<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Bonded investigators use intelligent familiars to assist them in their investigations. They are common in the Inner Sea region&#146;s bustling cities, where a rat, cat, raven, or another small animal can go largely unnoticed.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon. Mixing gumption and learnedness into a personal alchemy of daring, investigators are full of surprises. Observing the world around them, they gain valuable knowledge about the situation they&#146;re in, process that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut to the quick of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators are always evaluating situations they encounter, sizing up potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers, all while using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to find solutions to the most perplexing problems.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Investigators live to solve mysteries and find inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as advisors and support for their adventuring parties, but can take center stage when knowledge and cunning are needed. No slouches in battle, they know how to make surprise attacks and use inspiration to bring those attacks home.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Alchemist and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Investigator's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Investigators are proficient with simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, short sword, and sword caneUE. They are proficient in light armors, but not shields.</p>
			<p><b>Alchemy (Su): </b>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
			<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
			<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
			<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
			<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
			<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
			<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
			<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
			<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>An investigator adds 1/2 his level to Perception skill checks made to locate traps and to Disable Device checks (minimum 1). An investigator can use Disable Device to disarm magical traps.</p>
			<p><b>Familiar (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a bonded investigator gains a familiar to aid him. This familiar functions as the wizard arcane bond class feature, using the bonded investigator&#146;s class level to determine the familiar&#146;s special abilities. The bonded investigator&#146;s extracts are considered spells for the purposes of familiar abilities like share spell and deliver touch spells.</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talent (Ex or Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can only be selected once.</p>
			<p>Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an investigator&#146;s studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p>See the Investigator Talents section for a full list of Talents from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Keen Recollection: </b>At 3rd level, an investigator can attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Trap Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, an investigator gains an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps, granting him a +1 bonus on Ref lex saving throws to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by traps. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1 (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).</p>
			<p><b>Inspired Familiar (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a bonded investigator&#146;s familiar becomes a cunning assistant to the investigator. The familiar can access the investigator&#146;s inspiration pool to augment its own actions; the use of inspiration is deducted from the investigator&#146;s number of daily uses as normal. The familiar can use the inspiration ability (and gains the increased benefits of investigator talents that affect the bonus dice used in this ability) but cannot expend uses of inspiration for other purposes.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Combat (Ex): </b>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Alchemy (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can create alchemical items with astounding speed. It takes an investigator half the normal amount of time to create alchemical items. He can also apply poison to a weapon as a move action instead of a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Strike (Ex): </b>At 6th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a free action, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage. At 10th level and every 4 investigator levels thereafter, this damage increases by +1d6. The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.</p>
			<p>If the investigator&#146;s attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to make an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual &#150;4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.</p>
			<p>The investigator must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. An investigator cannot use studied strike against a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Familiar (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a bonded investigator gains the Improved Familiar feat as a bonus feat, treating his investigator level as his arcane caster level for the purposes of determining what familiars are available to him.</p>
			<p><b>True Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an investigator can use inspiration on all skill checks&#151;even ones he isn&#146;t trained in&#151;and all ability checks without spending inspiration.</p>
			<p>In addition, whenever he expends inspiration on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can affect this. If using the amazing inspiration investigator talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If using this with empathy, tenacious inspiration, underworld inspiration, or a similar talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the higher of the two results.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
					<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>

					<p>Antiquarians emulate Arustun, founder of the Jistka Imperium, by exploring and recording the remnants of lost civilizations. Rather than using extracts, an antiquarian carries a collection of holy and unholy symbols, charms, and trinkets.

					<p>An antiquarian begins play with a collection of religious trinkets that functions as his formula book and weighs 2 pounds total, with each trinket functioning as a formula. Adding new trinkets has the same cost and time requirement as adding formulae to a formula book. An antiquarian can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook or alchemist&#146;s formula book to learn formulae, but an antiquarian&#146;s trinket collection is too esoteric for anyone except another antiquarian to learn spells from. An antiquarian prepares spells by meditating and charging relics with supernatural power, which has the same requirements and limitations as preparing extracts. However, instead of creating extracts, an antiquarian casts spells as though he were an arcane spellcaster, which means he can affect other creatures with his spells. An antiquarian does not suffer from arcane spell failure.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Antiquarians are collectors, explorers, and scholars who delve into ruined places in search of lost lore and artifacts.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon. Mixing gumption and learnedness into a personal alchemy of daring, investigators are full of surprises. Observing the world around them, they gain valuable knowledge about the situation they&#146;re in, process that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut to the quick of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators are always evaluating situations they encounter, sizing up potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers, all while using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to find solutions to the most perplexing problems.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Investigators live to solve mysteries and find inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as advisors and support for their adventuring parties, but can take center stage when knowledge and cunning are needed. No slouches in battle, they know how to make surprise attacks and use inspiration to bring those attacks home.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Alchemist and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Investigators are proficient with simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, short sword, and sword caneUE. They are proficient in light armors, but not shields.</p>
			<p><b>Alchemy (Su): </b>Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p>
			<p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p>
			<p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator&#146;s level as the caster level.</p>
			<p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1&#150;8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p>
			<p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping&#151;an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p>
			<p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant&#151;comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p>
			<p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator&#146;s extract is equal to 10 + the extract&#146;s level + the investigator&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator&#146;s or an alchemist&#146;s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled&#151;he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration in other situations.</p>
			<p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night&#146;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he&#146;s trained in the skill.</p>
			<p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator&#146;s pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Relic Magic (Su): </b>Antiquarians emulate Arustun, founder of the Jistka Imperium, by exploring and recording the remnants of lost civilizations. Rather than using extracts, an antiquarian carries a collection of holy and unholy symbols, charms, and trinkets. Though an antiquarian may never know who or what grants him his power, he can produce magical effects all the same. Relic magic functions as the alchemy class feature, except as noted below.</p>
			<p>An antiquarian begins play with a collection of religious trinkets that functions as his formula book and weighs 2 pounds total, with each trinket functioning as a formula. Adding new trinkets has the same cost and time requirement as adding formulae to a formula book. An antiquarian can study a wizard&#146;s spellbook or alchemist&#146;s formula book to learn formulae, but an antiquarian&#146;s trinket collection is too esoteric for anyone except another antiquarian to learn spells from. An antiquarian prepares spells by meditating and charging relics with supernatural power, which has the same requirements and limitations as preparing extracts. However, instead of creating extracts, an antiquarian casts spells as though he were an arcane spellcaster, which means he can affect other creatures with his spells. An antiquarian does not suffer from arcane spell failure.</p>
			<p>An antiquarian doesn&#146;t gain a competence bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks to create alchemical items, and he cannot identify potions with that skill. Furthermore, he cannot select alchemist discoveries as investigator talents.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding: </b>An investigator adds 1/2 his level to Perception skill checks made to locate traps and to Disable Device checks (minimum 1). An investigator can use Disable Device to disarm magical traps.</p>
			<p><b>Curse Resistance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, an antiquarian gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against spells and effects with the curse descriptor. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level and to +6 at 8th level. At 11th level, the antiquarian becomes completely immune to such effects.</p>
			<p><b>Item Lore (Ex): </b>An antiquarian can identify even the most esoteric objects at a glance. At 2nd level, he can discern whether an item is magical simply by studying it for 1 round. Once he identifies a magic item in this way, he can use Spellcraft to attempt to identify the properties of the magic item as if he had used detect magic. Furthermore, he can detect whether an item is cursed if his check to identify the magic item exceeds the DC by 5.</p>
			<p><b>Investigator Talent (Ex or Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can only be selected once.</p>
			<p>Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an investigator&#146;s studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt.</p>
			<p>See the Investigator Talents section for a full list of Talents from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Keen Recollection: </b>At 3rd level, an investigator can attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Trap Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, an investigator gains an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps, granting him a +1 bonus on Ref lex saving throws to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by traps. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1 (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).</p>
			<p><b>Studied Combat (Ex): </b>With a keen eye and calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
			<p>An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator&#146;s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator&#146;s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Strike (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike against the target of his studied combat as a free action, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.</p>
			<p>If the investigator&#146;s attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to make an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual &#150;4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.</p>
			<p>The investigator must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. An investigator cannot use studied strike against a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Search (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an antiquarian can study the secrets of a location with incredible speed. Whenever he takes 20 on a Perception check, it takes him only 1 minute.</p>
			<p><b>True Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an investigator can use inspiration on all skill checks&#151;even ones he isn&#146;t trained in&#151;and all ability checks without spending inspiration.</p>
			<p>In addition, whenever he expends inspiration on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can affect this. If using the amazing inspiration investigator talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If using this with empathy, tenacious inspiration, underworld inspiration, or a similar talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the higher of the two results.</p>
