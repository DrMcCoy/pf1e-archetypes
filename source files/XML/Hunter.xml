					<p>A hunter casts divine spells drawn from the druid and ranger spell lists. Only druid spells of 6th level and lower and ranger spells are considered to be part of the hunter spell list. If a spell appears on both the druid and ranger spell lists, the hunter uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. For instance, reduce animal is a 2nd-level druid spell and a 3rd-level ranger spell, making it a 2nd-level hunter spell. Likewise, detect poison is a 0-level druid spell and a 2nd-level ranger spell, making it a 0-level hunter spell.</p>
					<p>The hunter can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a hunter must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a hunter&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the hunter&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>A hunter cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful Use Magic Device check) of druid spells of 7th level or higher. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells below.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a hunter can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-6: Hunter. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>Unlike druids and rangers, a hunter&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. A hunter begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new hunter level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a hunter knows is not affected by her Wisdom score; the numbers on Table 1-7 are fixed.</p>
					<p>In addition to the spells gained by hunters as they gain levels, each hunter also automatically adds all summon nature&#146;s ally spells to her list of spells known. These spells are added as soon as the hunter is capable of casting them.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and at every 3 levels thereafter, a hunter can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the hunter loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A hunter may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any summon nature&#146;s ally spells.</p>
					<p>Unlike a druid or ranger, a hunter need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.</p>

				<name type="string">Animal Companion</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a hunter forms a bond with an animal companion. A hunter may begin play with any of the animals available to a druid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the hunter on her adventures. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the nature bond class feature). The hunter&#146;s effective druid level is equal to her hunter level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the companion&#146;s statistics and abilities. A hunter may teach her companion hunter&#146;s tricks from the skirmisher ranger archetype (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&#146;s Guide 128) instead of standard tricks. The animal companion can use skirmisher tricks when commanded, a number of times per day equal to half its Hit Dice plus its Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>If a hunter releases her companion from service or her animal companion perishes, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. While the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, any animal she summons with a summon nature&#146;s ally spell remains for 1 minute per level instead of 1 round per level. A hunter cannot have more than one summon nature&#146;s ally spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon nature&#146;s ally immediately ends.</p>

				<name type="string">Animal Focus</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a hunter can take on the aspect of an animal as a swift action. She must select one type of animal to emulate, gaining a bonus or special ability based on the type of animal emulated and her hunter level. The hunter can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. The hunter can emulate only one animal at a time.</p>
					<p>The hunter can also apply one of these aspects to her animal companion. Unlike with the hunter herself, there is no duration on the animal aspect applied to her animal companion. An aspect applied in this way does not count against the hunter&#146;s minutes of duration per day-it remains in effect until the hunter changes it. The companion&#146;s aspect can be the same aspect the ranger has taken on or a different one. The hunter can select or change the animal foci on both herself and her animal companion as part of the same swift action.</p>
					<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, the hunter can apply her companion&#146;s animal focus to herself instead of her animal companion. This is in addition to the normal one she can choose, and (as with a companion&#146;s focus) remains in effect until the hunter changes it instead of counting against her minutes per day.</p>
					<p>See the Hunter Animal Focuses section for a full list of Focuses from all sources.</p>

				<name type="string">Wild Empathy</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A hunter can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Chapter 4 of the Core Rulebook). The hunter rolls 1d20 and adds her hunter level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
					<p>To use wild empathy, the hunter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, inf luencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
					<p>The hunter can also use this ability to inf luence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A hunter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A hunter casts divine spells drawn from the druid and ranger spell lists. Only druid spells of 6th level and lower and ranger spells are considered to be part of the hunter spell list. If a spell appears on both the druid and ranger spell lists, the hunter uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. For instance, reduce animal is a 2nd-level druid spell and a 3rd-level ranger spell, making it a 2nd-level hunter spell. Likewise, detect poison is a 0-level druid spell and a 2nd-level ranger spell, making it a 0-level hunter spell.</p>
			<p>The hunter can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a hunter must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a hunter&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the hunter&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>A hunter cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful Use Magic Device check) of druid spells of 7th level or higher. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells below.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a hunter can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-6: Hunter. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike druids and rangers, a hunter&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. A hunter begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new hunter level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a hunter knows is not affected by her Wisdom score; the numbers on Table 1-7 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by hunters as they gain levels, each hunter also automatically adds all summon nature&#146;s ally spells to her list of spells known. These spells are added as soon as the hunter is capable of casting them.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and at every 3 levels thereafter, a hunter can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the hunter loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A hunter may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any summon nature&#146;s ally spells.</p>
			<p>Unlike a druid or ranger, a hunter need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Hunters learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells: </b>A hunter can&#146;t cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity&#146;s (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Animal Companion (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a hunter forms a bond with an animal companion. A hunter may begin play with any of the animals available to a druid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the hunter on her adventures. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the nature bond class feature). The hunter&#146;s effective druid level is equal to her hunter level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the companion&#146;s statistics and abilities. A hunter may teach her companion hunter&#146;s tricks from the skirmisher ranger archetype (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&#146;s Guide 128) instead of standard tricks. The animal companion can use skirmisher tricks when commanded, a number of times per day equal to half its Hit Dice plus its Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>If a hunter releases her companion from service or her animal companion perishes, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. While the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, any animal she summons with a summon nature&#146;s ally spell remains for 1 minute per level instead of 1 round per level. A hunter cannot have more than one summon nature&#146;s ally spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon nature&#146;s ally immediately ends.</p>
			<p><b>Animal Focus (Su): </b>At 1st level, a hunter can take on the aspect of an animal as a swift action. She must select one type of animal to emulate, gaining a bonus or special ability based on the type of animal emulated and her hunter level. The hunter can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. The hunter can emulate only one animal at a time.</p>
			<p>The hunter can also apply one of these aspects to her animal companion. Unlike with the hunter herself, there is no duration on the animal aspect applied to her animal companion. An aspect applied in this way does not count against the hunter&#146;s minutes of duration per day-it remains in effect until the hunter changes it. The companion&#146;s aspect can be the same aspect the ranger has taken on or a different one. The hunter can select or change the animal foci on both herself and her animal companion as part of the same swift action.</p>
			<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, the hunter can apply her companion&#146;s animal focus to herself instead of her animal companion. This is in addition to the normal one she can choose, and (as with a companion&#146;s focus) remains in effect until the hunter changes it instead of counting against her minutes per day.</p>
			<p>See the Hunter Animal Focuses section for a full list of Focuses from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Training (Ex): </b>A hunter counts her total hunter level as both druid levels and ranger levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats, traits, and options that modify or improve an animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A hunter can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Chapter 4 of the Core Rulebook). The hunter rolls 1d20 and adds her hunter level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the hunter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, inf luencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The hunter can also use this ability to inf luence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Precise Companion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hunter chooses either Precise Shot or OutflankAPG as a bonus feat. She does not need to meet the prerequisites for this feat. If she chooses Outflank, she automatically grants this feat to her animal companion as well.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hunter adds 1/2 her level to Survival skill checks made to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Hunter Tactics (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, the hunter automatically grants her teamwork feats to her animal companion. The companion doesn&#146;t need to meet the prerequisites of these teamwork feats.</p>
			<p><b>Teamwork Feat: </b>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, the hunter gains a bonus teamwork feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. The hunter must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus teamwork feat.</p>
			<p>As a standard action, the hunter can choose to learn a new bonus teamwork feat in place of the most recent bonus teamwork feat she has already learned. In effect, the hunter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. She can change only the most recent teamwork feat gained, and must meet the prerequisites for the newly selected feat. A hunter can change her most recent teamwork feat a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Whenever she gains a new teamwork feat, her previous teamwork feats become permanent.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Empathic Link (Su): </b>At 4th level, the hunter gains an empathic link with her animal companion. This functions like an empathic link with a familiar, except the hunter can also see through a companion&#146;s eyes as a swift action, maintaining this connection as long as she likes (as long as the companion is within 1 mile) and ending it as a free action. The hunter is blinded while maintaining this connection.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a hunter and her animal companion may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at their normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion will still affect the hunter and her animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Tricks (Ex): </b>At 7th level and every 6 levels thereafter, a hunter&#146;s animal companion learns a bonus trick (in addition to the bonus tricks gained from the hunter&#146;s effective druid level).</p>
			<p><b>Second Animal Focus (Su): </b>At 8th level, whenever a hunter uses her animal focus ability, she selects two different animal aspects for herself instead of one, and can assign two aspects to her companion instead of one. As with the companion&#146;s previous aspect, the second one does not count against the minutes per day a hunter can take on an aspect.</p>
			<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead and the hunter has applied the companion&#146;s animal aspect to herself, that aspect does not count toward her maximum of two aspects at once. The hunter can still apply only one of her dead companion&#146;s aspects to herself, not both.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a hunter can move at her normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. She takes only a -10 penalty (instead of the normal -20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Raise Animal Companion (Sp): </b>At 10th level, a hunter gains raise animal companionUM as a spell-like ability; this is not restricted to raising only her own animal companion. Using this spell-like ability gives the hunter a permanent negative level. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration), but automatically ends after 24 hours. At 16th level, this functions as resurrection instead of raise dead, but otherwise operates as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Speak with Master (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a hunter and her animal companion can communicate verbally, as if they were using a common language. Other creatures cannot understand the communication without magical aid.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Empathic Link (Su): </b>At 14th level, the range of the hunter&#146;s empathic link with her animal companion increases to 10 miles. If the animal companion is within 1 mile, the hunter can communicate with it telepathically.</p>
			<p><b>One with the Wild (Ex): </b>At 17th level, the hunter and her animal companion are respected or even feared by other animals, so long as the animals are approximately of the same type as any of the hunter&#146;s current animal foci: bat for bats, tiger with felines, falcon for birds, snake for reptiles, and so on. No animal in this category (including dire varieties) willingly attacks the hunter or her companion unless magically compelled to or if the hunter or companion attacks it first.</p>
			<p>The hunter and her companion can attempt to demoralize animals in the appropriate category as a swift action, rolling 1d20 and adding the hunter&#146;s level and her Charisma modifier to determine the Intimidate check result.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a hunter becomes a master hunter, able to track down foes with ease. She can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty.</p>
			<p>Additionally, each day when the hunter regains her spell slots, she chooses one animal focus to be active on herself for the entire day. This focus is in addition to using her animal focus class ability (including the additional focus ability she is able to use on herself if her animal companion is dead).</p>

					<p>Ant: The creature gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level.</p>
					<p>Beetle: The creature gains a +2 enhancement bonus to its natural armor bonus. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level. (A creature without natural armor has an effective natural armor bonus of +0.)</p>

If the hunter or his animal companion attacks a swarm, they lose this protection against only that swarm. This ability replaces woodland stride.</p>

					<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead and the hunter has applied the companion&#146;s animal aspect to herself, that aspect does not count toward her maximum of two aspects at once. The hunter can still apply only one of her dead companion&#146;s aspects to herself, not both.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A verminous hunter calls on the ceaseless, single-minded dedication of vermin to hunt and overwhelm her prey. Where other hunters invoke the cunning, animalistic powers of the alpha predators, she calls on the powers of the lowest life forms, reaching out to the spider instead of the monkey, the mantis instead of the snake, or the moth instead of the owl.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Hunters are warriors of the wilds that have forged close bonds with trusted animal companions. They focus their tactics on fighting alongside their companion animals as a formidable team of two. Able to cast a wide variety of nature spells and take on the abilities and attributes of beasts, hunters magically improve both themselves and their animal companions.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Hunters can adapt their tactics to many kinds of opponents, and cherish their highly trained animal companions. As a team, the hunter and her companion can react to danger with incredible speed, making them excellent scouts, explorers, and saboteurs.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any neutral.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Druid and ranger.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Hunter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A hunter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A hunter casts divine spells drawn from the druid and ranger spell lists. Only druid spells of 6th level and lower and ranger spells are considered to be part of the hunter spell list. If a spell appears on both the druid and ranger spell lists, the hunter uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. For instance, reduce animal is a 2nd-level druid spell and a 3rd-level ranger spell, making it a 2nd-level hunter spell. Likewise, detect poison is a 0-level druid spell and a 2nd-level ranger spell, making it a 0-level hunter spell.</p>
			<p>The hunter can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a hunter must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a hunter&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the hunter&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>A hunter cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful Use Magic Device check) of druid spells of 7th level or higher. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells below.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a hunter can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-6: Hunter. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike druids and rangers, a hunter&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. A hunter begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new hunter level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a hunter knows is not affected by her Wisdom score; the numbers on Table 1-7 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by hunters as they gain levels, each hunter also automatically adds all summon nature&#146;s ally spells to her list of spells known. These spells are added as soon as the hunter is capable of casting them.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and at every 3 levels thereafter, a hunter can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the hunter loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A hunter may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any summon nature&#146;s ally spells.</p>
			<p>Unlike a druid or ranger, a hunter need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Hunters learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells: </b>A hunter can&#146;t cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity&#146;s (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Training (Ex): </b>A hunter counts her total hunter level as both druid levels and ranger levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats, traits, and options that modify or improve an animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Vermin Companion (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a verminous hunter must choose a vermin companion instead of an animal companion (Ultimate Magic 36). This ability alters animal companion. The hunter tactics class ability allows a verminous hunter to grant her teamwork feats to a mindless vermin companion.</p>
			<p><b>Vermin Empathy (Ex): </b>A verminous hunter gains the wild empathy ability, but can use it only to influence vermin (not animals or magical beasts). This ability alters wild empathy.</p>
			<p><b>Vermin Focus (Su): </b>A verminous hunter can take on the aspect of a vermin. This functions as animal focus, but allows only the following choices.</p>
			<p>Ant: The creature gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Beetle: The creature gains a +2 enhancement bonus to its natural armor bonus. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level. (A creature without natural armor has an effective natural armor bonus of +0.)</p>
			<p>Centipede: The creature gains a +2 competence bonus on Climb checks and a +2 bonus to CMD against pull, push, reposition, and trip combat maneuvers. These bonuses increase to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Cockroach: The creature gains a +4 bonus on saves against cold dangers, disease, heat dangers, starvation, thirst, and on Constitution checks to avoid suffocation. These bonuses increase to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Crab: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Swim checks and a +2 competence bonus on grapple combat maneuver checks. These bonuses increase to +6 and +4 respectively at 8th level, and +8 and +6 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Flea: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on saves against disease and Acrobatics checks to jump. These bonuses increase to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Fly: The creature gains a +2 bonus on Perception checks and on Acrobatics checks to balance or fall safely. These bonuses increase to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Leech: The creature gains a +2 competence bonus on grapple combat maneuver checks, and deals 1 point of bleed damage every time it succeeds at a grapple combat maneuver check to damage an opponent. These benefits increase to a +4 bonus and 3 points of bleed at 8th level, and a +6 bonus and 5 points of bleed at 15th level. Bleed damage from this ability does not stack with itself.</p>
			<p>Mantis: The creature gains a +2 bonus on attack of opportunity attack rolls and a +2 competence bonus on grapple combat maneuver checks. These bonuses increase to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Moth: The creature gains darkvision to a range of 60 feet. At 8th level, the range increases by 30 feet. At 15th level, the creature gains blindsense to a range of 10 feet.</p>
			<p>Phasmid: The creature gains low-light vision and a +4 competence bonus on Stealth checks in forests or plains. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Scorpion: The creature gains a +2 competence bonus on Stealth checks and grapple combat maneuver checks. These bonuses increase to +6 and +4 respectively at 8th level, and +8 and +6 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Spider: The creature gains a +2 competence bonus on Stealth checks, saving throws against web effects (magical or otherwise), and checks to break free of webs. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Wasp: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Perception checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Worm: The creature gains a 25% chance to treat any critical hit or sneak attack as a normal hit (as the fortification armor special ability). This increases to 50% at 8th level, and 75% at 15th level.</p>
			<p><b>Precise Companion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hunter chooses either Precise Shot or OutflankAPG as a bonus feat. She does not need to meet the prerequisites for this feat. If she chooses Outflank, she automatically grants this feat to her animal companion as well.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hunter adds 1/2 her level to Survival skill checks made to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Hunter Tactics (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, the hunter automatically grants her teamwork feats to her animal companion. The companion doesn&#146;t need to meet the prerequisites of these teamwork feats.</p>
			<p><b>Teamwork Feat: </b>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, the hunter gains a bonus teamwork feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. The hunter must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus teamwork feat.</p>
			<p>As a standard action, the hunter can choose to learn a new bonus teamwork feat in place of the most recent bonus teamwork feat she has already learned. In effect, the hunter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. She can change only the most recent teamwork feat gained, and must meet the prerequisites for the newly selected feat. A hunter can change her most recent teamwork feat a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Whenever she gains a new teamwork feat, her previous teamwork feats become permanent.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Empathic Link (Su): </b>At 4th level, the hunter gains an empathic link with her animal companion. This functions like an empathic link with a familiar, except the hunter can also see through a companion&#146;s eyes as a swift action, maintaining this connection as long as she likes (as long as the companion is within 1 mile) and ending it as a free action. The hunter is blinded while maintaining this connection.</p>
			<p><b>Swarm Stride (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a verminous hunter learns to move through vermin without danger. He can safely pass through swarms of vermin and does not take swarm damage while within a vermin swarm&#146;s space. In addition, he is immune to a swarm&#146;s distraction ability. If the hunter or his animal companion attacks a swarm, they lose this protection against only that swarm. This ability replaces woodland stride.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Tricks (Ex): </b>At 7th level and every 6 levels thereafter, a hunter&#146;s animal companion learns a bonus trick (in addition to the bonus tricks gained from the hunter&#146;s effective druid level).</p>
			<p><b>Second Animal Focus (Su): </b>At 8th level, whenever a hunter uses her animal focus ability, she selects two different animal aspects for herself instead of one, and can assign two aspects to her companion instead of one. As with the companion&#146;s previous aspect, the second one does not count against the minutes per day a hunter can take on an aspect.</p>
			<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead and the hunter has applied the companion&#146;s animal aspect to herself, that aspect does not count toward her maximum of two aspects at once. The hunter can still apply only one of her dead companion&#146;s aspects to herself, not both.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a hunter can move at her normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. She takes only a -10 penalty (instead of the normal -20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Raise Animal Companion (Sp): </b>At 10th level, a hunter gains raise animal companionUM as a spell-like ability; this is not restricted to raising only her own animal companion. Using this spell-like ability gives the hunter a permanent negative level. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration), but automatically ends after 24 hours. At 16th level, this functions as resurrection instead of raise dead, but otherwise operates as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Speak with Master (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a hunter and her animal companion can communicate verbally, as if they were using a common language. Other creatures cannot understand the communication without magical aid.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Empathic Link (Su): </b>At 14th level, the range of the hunter&#146;s empathic link with her animal companion increases to 10 miles. If the animal companion is within 1 mile, the hunter can communicate with it telepathically.</p>
			<p><b>One with the Wild (Ex): </b>At 17th level, the hunter and her animal companion are respected or even feared by other animals, so long as the animals are approximately of the same type as any of the hunter&#146;s current animal foci: bat for bats, tiger with felines, falcon for birds, snake for reptiles, and so on. No animal in this category (including dire varieties) willingly attacks the hunter or her companion unless magically compelled to or if the hunter or companion attacks it first.</p>
			<p>The hunter and her companion can attempt to demoralize animals in the appropriate category as a swift action, rolling 1d20 and adding the hunter&#146;s level and her Charisma modifier to determine the Intimidate check result.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a hunter becomes a master hunter, able to track down foes with ease. She can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty.</p>
			<p>Additionally, each day when the hunter regains her spell slots, she chooses one animal focus to be active on herself for the entire day. This focus is in addition to using her animal focus class ability (including the additional focus ability she is able to use on herself if her animal companion is dead).</p>

					<p>A hunter casts divine spells drawn from the druid and ranger spell lists. Only druid spells of 6th level and lower and ranger spells are considered to be part of the hunter spell list. If a spell appears on both the druid and ranger spell lists, the hunter uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. For instance, reduce animal is a 2nd-level druid spell and a 3rd-level ranger spell, making it a 2nd-level hunter spell. Likewise, detect poison is a 0-level druid spell and a 2nd-level ranger spell, making it a 0-level hunter spell.</p>
					<p>The hunter can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a hunter must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a hunter&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the hunter&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>A hunter cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful Use Magic Device check) of druid spells of 7th level or higher. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells below.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a hunter can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-6: Hunter. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>Unlike druids and rangers, a hunter&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. A hunter begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new hunter level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a hunter knows is not affected by her Wisdom score; the numbers on Table 1-7 are fixed.</p>
					<p>In addition to the spells gained by hunters as they gain levels, each hunter also automatically adds all summon nature&#146;s ally spells to her list of spells known. These spells are added as soon as the hunter is capable of casting them.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and at every 3 levels thereafter, a hunter can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the hunter loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A hunter may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any summon nature&#146;s ally spells.</p>
					<p>Unlike a druid or ranger, a hunter need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Urban hunters have animal companions that are domesticated animals or animals native to a major city. The urban hunter must select her animal companion from the following list: axe beakB3, badger, bird, camel, dire rat, dog, horse, llama (Pathfinder Player Companion: Animal Archive 28), ostrich (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Osirion, Legacy of Pharaohs 55), pony, ramB2, or trumpeter swanB4. In urban settings, an urban hunter&#146;s animal companion seems domesticated and likely harmless to anyone who has not seen it in combat (potentially reducing the DC of Diplomacy checks to convince anyone to allow it into secure areas). It draws no more attention than a friendly dog, loyal horse, or similar tame animal.</p>
					<p>Creatures who have never seen the animal companion make an attack must succeed at a Sense Motive check (opposed by the animal companion&#146;s Stealth check) to realize the animal companion is a potential threat. The hunter can calm those who witness her animal companion&#146;s attacks (so long as they were not injured) with a successful Handle Animal check (DC = 15 + the target&#146;s Will save modifier).</p>

					<p>At 1st level, a hunter can take on the aspect of an animal as a swift action. She must select one type of animal to emulate, gaining a bonus or special ability based on the type of animal emulated and her hunter level. The hunter can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. The hunter can emulate only one animal at a time.</p>
					<p>The hunter can also apply one of these aspects to her animal companion. Unlike with the hunter herself, there is no duration on the animal aspect applied to her animal companion. An aspect applied in this way does not count against the hunter&#146;s minutes of duration per day-it remains in effect until the hunter changes it. The companion&#146;s aspect can be the same aspect the ranger has taken on or a different one. The hunter can select or change the animal foci on both herself and her animal companion as part of the same swift action.</p>
					<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, the hunter can apply her companion&#146;s animal focus to herself instead of her animal companion. This is in addition to the normal one she can choose, and (as with a companion&#146;s focus) remains in effect until the hunter changes it instead of counting against her minutes per day.</p>

					<p>A hunter can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Chapter 4 of the Core Rulebook). The hunter rolls 1d20 and adds her hunter level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
					<p>To use wild empathy, the hunter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, inf luencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
					<p>The hunter can also use this ability to inf luence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A hunter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A hunter casts divine spells drawn from the druid and ranger spell lists. Only druid spells of 6th level and lower and ranger spells are considered to be part of the hunter spell list. If a spell appears on both the druid and ranger spell lists, the hunter uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. For instance, reduce animal is a 2nd-level druid spell and a 3rd-level ranger spell, making it a 2nd-level hunter spell. Likewise, detect poison is a 0-level druid spell and a 2nd-level ranger spell, making it a 0-level hunter spell.</p>
			<p>The hunter can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a hunter must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a hunter&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the hunter&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>A hunter cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful Use Magic Device check) of druid spells of 7th level or higher. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells below.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a hunter can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-6: Hunter. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike druids and rangers, a hunter&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. A hunter begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new hunter level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a hunter knows is not affected by her Wisdom score; the numbers on Table 1-7 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by hunters as they gain levels, each hunter also automatically adds all summon nature&#146;s ally spells to her list of spells known. These spells are added as soon as the hunter is capable of casting them.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and at every 3 levels thereafter, a hunter can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the hunter loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A hunter may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any summon nature&#146;s ally spells.</p>
			<p>Unlike a druid or ranger, a hunter need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Hunters learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells: </b>A hunter can&#146;t cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity&#146;s (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Animal Companion (Ex): </b>Urban hunters have animal companions that are domesticated animals or animals native to a major city. The urban hunter must select her animal companion from the following list: axe beakB3, badger, bird, camel, dire rat, dog, horse, llama (Pathfinder Player Companion: Animal Archive 28), ostrich (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Osirion, Legacy of Pharaohs 55), pony, ram, or trumpeter swan. In urban settings, an urban hunter&#146;s animal companion seems domesticated and likely harmless to anyone who has not seen it in combat (potentially reducing the DC of Diplomacy checks to convince anyone to allow it into secure areas). It draws no more attention than a friendly dog, loyal horse, or similar tame animal.</p>
			<p>Creatures who have never seen the animal companion make an attack must succeed at a Sense Motive check (opposed by the animal companion&#146;s Stealth check) to realize the animal companion is a potential threat. The hunter can calm those who witness her animal companion&#146;s attacks (so long as they were not injured) with a successful Handle Animal check (DC = 15 + the target&#146;s Will save modifier).</p>
			<p><b>Animal Focus (Su): </b>At 1st level, a hunter can take on the aspect of an animal as a swift action. She must select one type of animal to emulate, gaining a bonus or special ability based on the type of animal emulated and her hunter level. The hunter can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. The hunter can emulate only one animal at a time.</p>
			<p>The hunter can also apply one of these aspects to her animal companion. Unlike with the hunter herself, there is no duration on the animal aspect applied to her animal companion. An aspect applied in this way does not count against the hunter&#146;s minutes of duration per day-it remains in effect until the hunter changes it. The companion&#146;s aspect can be the same aspect the ranger has taken on or a different one. The hunter can select or change the animal foci on both herself and her animal companion as part of the same swift action.</p>
			<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, the hunter can apply her companion&#146;s animal focus to herself instead of her animal companion. This is in addition to the normal one she can choose, and (as with a companion&#146;s focus) remains in effect until the hunter changes it instead of counting against her minutes per day.</p>
			<p>See the Hunter Animal Focuses section for a full list of Focuses from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Training (Ex): </b>A hunter counts her total hunter level as both druid levels and ranger levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats, traits, and options that modify or improve an animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A hunter can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Chapter 4 of the Core Rulebook). The hunter rolls 1d20 and adds her hunter level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the hunter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, inf luencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The hunter can also use this ability to inf luence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Precise Companion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hunter chooses either Precise Shot or OutflankAPG as a bonus feat. She does not need to meet the prerequisites for this feat. If she chooses Outflank, she automatically grants this feat to her animal companion as well.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hunter adds 1/2 her level to Survival skill checks made to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Captor (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, an urban hunter and her animal companion take no penalties when dealing nonlethal damage with weapons or natural attacks. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the urban hunter selects a bonus feat from the following list to be gained by both the hunter and her animal companion: Improved Bull Rush, Improved Dirty Trick, Improved Disarm, Improved Grapple, and Improved Trip. At 12th level, the hunter can also select from the following feats: Combat Patrol, Combat Reflexes, Disarming Strike, Greater Bull Rush, Greater Dirty Trick, Greater Disarm, Greater Grapple, Greater Trip, and Lunge. Neither the hunter nor her animal companion needs to meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats. This ability replaces hunter tactics and teamwork feat.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Empathic Link (Su): </b>At 4th level, the hunter gains an empathic link with her animal companion. This functions like an empathic link with a familiar, except the hunter can also see through a companion&#146;s eyes as a swift action, maintaining this connection as long as she likes (as long as the companion is within 1 mile) and ending it as a free action. The hunter is blinded while maintaining this connection.</p>
			<p><b>Animal Insight (Ex): </b>At 5th level, an urban hunter and her animal companion learn to combine their insights to defeat deception and manipulation. As long as they are within 30 feet of each other, both hunter and animal companion gain an insight bonus on Sense Motive checks equal to half the urban hunter&#146;s hunter level. They also gain a +2 insight bonus on Will saving throws against illusions and mindaffecting effects. This ability replaces woodland stride.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Tricks (Ex): </b>At 7th level and every 6 levels thereafter, a hunter&#146;s animal companion learns a bonus trick (in addition to the bonus tricks gained from the hunter&#146;s effective druid level).</p>
			<p><b>Second Animal Focus (Su): </b>At 8th level, whenever a hunter uses her animal focus ability, she selects two different animal aspects for herself instead of one, and can assign two aspects to her companion instead of one. As with the companion&#146;s previous aspect, the second one does not count against the minutes per day a hunter can take on an aspect.</p>
			<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead and the hunter has applied the companion&#146;s animal aspect to herself, that aspect does not count toward her maximum of two aspects at once. The hunter can still apply only one of her dead companion&#146;s aspects to herself, not both.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a hunter can move at her normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. She takes only a -10 penalty (instead of the normal -20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Raise Animal Companion (Sp): </b>At 10th level, a hunter gains raise animal companionUM as a spell-like ability; this is not restricted to raising only her own animal companion. Using this spell-like ability gives the hunter a permanent negative level. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration), but automatically ends after 24 hours. At 16th level, this functions as resurrection instead of raise dead, but otherwise operates as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Speak with Master (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a hunter and her animal companion can communicate verbally, as if they were using a common language. Other creatures cannot understand the communication without magical aid.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Empathic Link (Su): </b>At 14th level, the range of the hunter&#146;s empathic link with her animal companion increases to 10 miles. If the animal companion is within 1 mile, the hunter can communicate with it telepathically.</p>
			<p><b>Frightful Ferocity (Ex): </b>At 17th level, an urban hunter and her animal companion can each attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize a foe as a swift action. This ability replaces one with the wild.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a hunter becomes a master hunter, able to track down foes with ease. She can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty.</p>
			<p>Additionally, each day when the hunter regains her spell slots, she chooses one animal focus to be active on herself for the entire day. This focus is in addition to using her animal focus class ability (including the additional focus ability she is able to use on herself if her animal companion is dead).</p>

					<p>At 1st level, a hunter forms a bond with an animal companion. A hunter may begin play with any of the animals available to a druid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the hunter on her adventures. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the nature bond class feature). The hunter&#146;s effective druid level is equal to her hunter level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the companion&#146;s statistics and abilities. A hunter may teach her companion hunter&#146;s tricks from the skirmisher ranger archetype (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&#146;s Guide 128) instead of standard tricks. The animal companion can use skirmisher tricks when commanded, a number of times per day equal to half its Hit Dice plus its Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>If a hunter releases her companion from service or her animal companion perishes, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. While the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, any animal she summons with a summon nature&#146;s ally spell remains for 1 minute per level instead of 1 round per level. A hunter cannot have more than one summon nature&#146;s ally spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon nature&#146;s ally immediately ends.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The Uprooters are an elite band of Kyonin elves skilled and brave enough to foray into the Tanglebriar and take the offensive in the fight against Treerazer. Uprooter scouts rely on their close bonds with their animal companions to survive such raids. One Uprooter scout who accompanied an expedition into the Worldwound to put his demon-fighting skills to work there has retired to Mendev to teach his techniques to others, so these skills are slowly being passed on to non-elves.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Hunters are warriors of the wilds that have forged close bonds with trusted animal companions. They focus their tactics on fighting alongside their companion animals as a formidable team of two. Able to cast a wide variety of nature spells and take on the abilities and attributes of beasts, hunters magically improve both themselves and their animal companions.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Hunters can adapt their tactics to many kinds of opponents, and cherish their highly trained animal companions. As a team, the hunter and her companion can react to danger with incredible speed, making them excellent scouts, explorers, and saboteurs.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any neutral.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Druid and ranger.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A hunter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A hunter casts divine spells drawn from the druid and ranger spell lists. Only druid spells of 6th level and lower and ranger spells are considered to be part of the hunter spell list. If a spell appears on both the druid and ranger spell lists, the hunter uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. For instance, reduce animal is a 2nd-level druid spell and a 3rd-level ranger spell, making it a 2nd-level hunter spell. Likewise, detect poison is a 0-level druid spell and a 2nd-level ranger spell, making it a 0-level hunter spell.</p>
			<p>The hunter can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a hunter must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a hunter&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the hunter&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>A hunter cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful Use Magic Device check) of druid spells of 7th level or higher. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells below.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a hunter can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-6: Hunter. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike druids and rangers, a hunter&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. A hunter begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new hunter level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a hunter knows is not affected by her Wisdom score; the numbers on Table 1-7 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by hunters as they gain levels, each hunter also automatically adds all summon nature&#146;s ally spells to her list of spells known. These spells are added as soon as the hunter is capable of casting them.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and at every 3 levels thereafter, a hunter can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the hunter loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A hunter may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any summon nature&#146;s ally spells.</p>
			<p>Unlike a druid or ranger, a hunter need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Hunters learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells: </b>A hunter can&#146;t cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity&#146;s (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Animal Companion (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a hunter forms a bond with an animal companion. A hunter may begin play with any of the animals available to a druid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the hunter on her adventures. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the nature bond class feature). The hunter&#146;s effective druid level is equal to her hunter level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the companion&#146;s statistics and abilities. A hunter may teach her companion hunter&#146;s tricks from the skirmisher ranger archetype (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&#146;s Guide 128) instead of standard tricks. The animal companion can use skirmisher tricks when commanded, a number of times per day equal to half its Hit Dice plus its Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>If a hunter releases her companion from service or her animal companion perishes, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. While the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, any animal she summons with a summon nature&#146;s ally spell remains for 1 minute per level instead of 1 round per level. A hunter cannot have more than one summon nature&#146;s ally spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon nature&#146;s ally immediately ends.</p>
			<p><b>Animal Focus (Su): </b>At 1st level, a hunter can take on the aspect of an animal as a swift action. She must select one type of animal to emulate, gaining a bonus or special ability based on the type of animal emulated and her hunter level. The hunter can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. The hunter can emulate only one animal at a time.</p>
			<p>The hunter can also apply one of these aspects to her animal companion. Unlike with the hunter herself, there is no duration on the animal aspect applied to her animal companion. An aspect applied in this way does not count against the hunter&#146;s minutes of duration per day-it remains in effect until the hunter changes it. The companion&#146;s aspect can be the same aspect the ranger has taken on or a different one. The hunter can select or change the animal foci on both herself and her animal companion as part of the same swift action.</p>
			<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, the hunter can apply her companion&#146;s animal focus to herself instead of her animal companion. This is in addition to the normal one she can choose, and (as with a companion&#146;s focus) remains in effect until the hunter changes it instead of counting against her minutes per day.</p>
			<p>See the Hunter Animal Focuses section for a full list of Focuses from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Training (Ex): </b>A hunter counts her total hunter level as both druid levels and ranger levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats, traits, and options that modify or improve an animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A hunter can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Chapter 4 of the Core Rulebook). The hunter rolls 1d20 and adds her hunter level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the hunter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, inf luencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The hunter can also use this ability to inf luence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Precise Companion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hunter chooses either Precise Shot or OutflankAPG as a bonus feat. She does not need to meet the prerequisites for this feat. If she chooses Outflank, she automatically grants this feat to her animal companion as well.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hunter adds 1/2 her level to Survival skill checks made to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Hunter Tactics (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, the hunter automatically grants her teamwork feats to her animal companion. The companion doesn&#146;t need to meet the prerequisites of these teamwork feats.</p>
			<p><b>Teamwork Feat: </b>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, the hunter gains a bonus teamwork feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. The hunter must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus teamwork feat.</p>
			<p>As a standard action, the hunter can choose to learn a new bonus teamwork feat in place of the most recent bonus teamwork feat she has already learned. In effect, the hunter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. She can change only the most recent teamwork feat gained, and must meet the prerequisites for the newly selected feat. A hunter can change her most recent teamwork feat a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Whenever she gains a new teamwork feat, her previous teamwork feats become permanent.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a hunter and her animal companion may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at their normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion will still affect the hunter and her animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Lore of the Blight (Ex): </b>At 6th level, an Uprooter scout and her animal companion gain a +2 bonus on initiative checks and on Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when she&#146;s in the Abyss or Abysstainted terrain (such as Tanglebriar or the Worldwound). When she travels through this terrain, she leaves no trail and can&#146;t be tracked (though she can leave a trail if she so chooses). This bonus increases to +4 at 11th level and +6 at 16th level. This ability replaces improved empathic link, speak with master, and greater empathic link.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Tricks (Ex): </b>At 7th level and every 6 levels thereafter, a hunter&#146;s animal companion learns a bonus trick (in addition to the bonus tricks gained from the hunter&#146;s effective druid level).</p>
			<p><b>Second Animal Focus (Su): </b>At 8th level, whenever a hunter uses her animal focus ability, she selects two different animal aspects for herself instead of one, and can assign two aspects to her companion instead of one. As with the companion&#146;s previous aspect, the second one does not count against the minutes per day a hunter can take on an aspect.</p>
			<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead and the hunter has applied the companion&#146;s animal aspect to herself, that aspect does not count toward her maximum of two aspects at once. The hunter can still apply only one of her dead companion&#146;s aspects to herself, not both.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a hunter can move at her normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. She takes only a -10 penalty (instead of the normal -20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Unnatural Stride (Ex): </b>At 10th level, the Uprooter scout and her animal companion learn how to move through undergrowth (as woodland stride) that has been enchanted, corrupted, or magically manipulated. This ability replaces raise animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Demon&#146;s End (Ex): </b>At 17th level, even demons must respect the number of their kindred an Uprooter scout has slain, and lesser demons quake before her. The Uprooter scout and her companion can attempt to demoralize a demon as a swift action, rolling 1d20 and adding the scout&#146;s level and her Charisma modifier to determine the Intimidate check result. This ability replaces one with the wild.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a hunter becomes a master hunter, able to track down foes with ease. She can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty.</p>
			<p>Additionally, each day when the hunter regains her spell slots, she chooses one animal focus to be active on herself for the entire day. This focus is in addition to using her animal focus class ability (including the additional focus ability she is able to use on herself if her animal companion is dead).</p>

					<p>A hunter casts divine spells drawn from the druid and ranger spell lists. Only druid spells of 6th level and lower and ranger spells are considered to be part of the hunter spell list. If a spell appears on both the druid and ranger spell lists, the hunter uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. For instance, reduce animal is a 2nd-level druid spell and a 3rd-level ranger spell, making it a 2nd-level hunter spell. Likewise, detect poison is a 0-level druid spell and a 2nd-level ranger spell, making it a 0-level hunter spell.</p>
					<p>The hunter can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a hunter must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a hunter&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the hunter&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>A hunter cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful Use Magic Device check) of druid spells of 7th level or higher. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells below.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a hunter can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-6: Hunter. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>Unlike druids and rangers, a hunter&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. A hunter begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new hunter level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a hunter knows is not affected by her Wisdom score; the numbers on Table 1-7 are fixed.</p>
					<p>In addition to the spells gained by hunters as they gain levels, each hunter also automatically adds all summon nature&#146;s ally spells to her list of spells known. These spells are added as soon as the hunter is capable of casting them.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and at every 3 levels thereafter, a hunter can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the hunter loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A hunter may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any summon nature&#146;s ally spells.</p>
					<p>Unlike a druid or ranger, a hunter need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.</p>

				<name type="string">Animal Companion</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, as a free action, a treestrider must select an ape as her animal companion.. A hunter may begin play with any of the animals available to a druid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the hunter on her adventures. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the nature bond class feature). The hunter&#146;s effective druid level is equal to her hunter level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the companion&#146;s statistics and abilities. A hunter may teach her companion hunter&#146;s tricks from the skirmisher ranger archetype (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&#146;s Guide 128) instead of standard tricks. The animal companion can use skirmisher tricks when commanded, a number of times per day equal to half its Hit Dice plus its Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>If a hunter releases her companion from service or her animal companion perishes, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. While the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, any animal she summons with a summon nature&#146;s ally spell remains for 1 minute per level instead of 1 round per level. A hunter cannot have more than one summon nature&#146;s ally spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon nature&#146;s ally immediately ends.</p>

					<p>At 1st level, a hunter can take on the aspect of an animal as a swift action. She must select one type of animal to emulate, gaining a bonus or special ability based on the type of animal emulated and her hunter level. The hunter can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. The hunter can emulate only one animal at a time.</p>
					<p>The hunter can also apply one of these aspects to her animal companion. Unlike with the hunter herself, there is no duration on the animal aspect applied to her animal companion. An aspect applied in this way does not count against the hunter&#146;s minutes of duration per day-it remains in effect until the hunter changes it. The companion&#146;s aspect can be the same aspect the ranger has taken on or a different one. The hunter can select or change the animal foci on both herself and her animal companion as part of the same swift action.</p>
					<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, the hunter can apply her companion&#146;s animal focus to herself instead of her animal companion. This is in addition to the normal one she can choose, and (as with a companion&#146;s focus) remains in effect until the hunter changes it instead of counting against her minutes per day.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A hunter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A hunter casts divine spells drawn from the druid and ranger spell lists. Only druid spells of 6th level and lower and ranger spells are considered to be part of the hunter spell list. If a spell appears on both the druid and ranger spell lists, the hunter uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. For instance, reduce animal is a 2nd-level druid spell and a 3rd-level ranger spell, making it a 2nd-level hunter spell. Likewise, detect poison is a 0-level druid spell and a 2nd-level ranger spell, making it a 0-level hunter spell.</p>
			<p>The hunter can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a hunter must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a hunter&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the hunter&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>A hunter cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful Use Magic Device check) of druid spells of 7th level or higher. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells below.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a hunter can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-6: Hunter. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike druids and rangers, a hunter&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. A hunter begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new hunter level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a hunter knows is not affected by her Wisdom score; the numbers on Table 1-7 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by hunters as they gain levels, each hunter also automatically adds all summon nature&#146;s ally spells to her list of spells known. These spells are added as soon as the hunter is capable of casting them.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and at every 3 levels thereafter, a hunter can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the hunter loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A hunter may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any summon nature&#146;s ally spells.</p>
			<p>Unlike a druid or ranger, a hunter need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Hunters learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells: </b>A hunter can&#146;t cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity&#146;s (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Animal Companion (Ex): </b>At 1st level, as a free action, a treestrider must select an ape as her animal companion.. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the hunter on her adventures. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the nature bond class feature). The hunter&#146;s effective druid level is equal to her hunter level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the companion&#146;s statistics and abilities. A hunter may teach her companion hunter&#146;s tricks from the skirmisher ranger archetype (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&#146;s Guide 128) instead of standard tricks. The animal companion can use skirmisher tricks when commanded, a number of times per day equal to half its Hit Dice plus its Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>If a hunter releases her companion from service or her animal companion perishes, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. While the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, any animal she summons with a summon nature&#146;s ally spell remains for 1 minute per level instead of 1 round per level. A hunter cannot have more than one summon nature&#146;s ally spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon nature&#146;s ally immediately ends.</p>
			<p><b>Animal Focus (Su): </b>At 1st level, a hunter can take on the aspect of an animal as a swift action. She must select one type of animal to emulate, gaining a bonus or special ability based on the type of animal emulated and her hunter level. The hunter can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. The hunter can emulate only one animal at a time.</p>
			<p>The hunter can also apply one of these aspects to her animal companion. Unlike with the hunter herself, there is no duration on the animal aspect applied to her animal companion. An aspect applied in this way does not count against the hunter&#146;s minutes of duration per day-it remains in effect until the hunter changes it. The companion&#146;s aspect can be the same aspect the ranger has taken on or a different one. The hunter can select or change the animal foci on both herself and her animal companion as part of the same swift action.</p>
			<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, the hunter can apply her companion&#146;s animal focus to herself instead of her animal companion. This is in addition to the normal one she can choose, and (as with a companion&#146;s focus) remains in effect until the hunter changes it instead of counting against her minutes per day.</p>
			<p>See the Hunter Animal Focuses section for a full list of Focuses from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Brachiation (Ex): </b>A treestrider can gain a climb speed equal to half her base speed as a free action for 1 minute per hunter level per day. This duration must be spent in 1-minute increments. In addition, she can use her climb speed to move through the canopies of forests or jungles, provided the limbs of the trees are strong enough to support her weight. The treestrider&#146;s companion gains a +10-foot enhancement bonus to its climb speed. At 8th level, the treestrider&#146;s climb speed increases to equal her base speed, the duration of her brachiation increases to 10 minutes per hunter level per day (usable in 10-minute increments), and the enhancement bonus to her companion&#146;s climb speed increases to +20 feet. At 15th level, she can use brachiation with no limit on the duration. This replaces animal focus and second animal focus.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Training (Ex): </b>A hunter counts her total hunter level as both druid levels and ranger levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats, traits, and options that modify or improve an animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A hunter can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Chapter 4 of the Core Rulebook). The hunter rolls 1d20 and adds her hunter level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the hunter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, inf luencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The hunter can also use this ability to inf luence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Unarmed Strike (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a treestrider gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hunter adds 1/2 her level to Survival skill checks made to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Hunter Tactics (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, the hunter automatically grants her teamwork feats to her animal companion. The companion doesn&#146;t need to meet the prerequisites of these teamwork feats.</p>
			<p><b>Teamwork Feat: </b>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, the hunter gains a bonus teamwork feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. The hunter must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus teamwork feat.</p>
			<p>As a standard action, the hunter can choose to learn a new bonus teamwork feat in place of the most recent bonus teamwork feat she has already learned. In effect, the hunter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. She can change only the most recent teamwork feat gained, and must meet the prerequisites for the newly selected feat. A hunter can change her most recent teamwork feat a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Whenever she gains a new teamwork feat, her previous teamwork feats become permanent.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Empathic Link (Su): </b>At 4th level, the hunter gains an empathic link with her animal companion. This functions like an empathic link with a familiar, except the hunter can also see through a companion&#146;s eyes as a swift action, maintaining this connection as long as she likes (as long as the companion is within 1 mile) and ending it as a free action. The hunter is blinded while maintaining this connection.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a hunter and her animal companion may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at their normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion will still affect the hunter and her animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Tricks (Ex): </b>At 7th level and every 6 levels thereafter, a hunter&#146;s animal companion learns a bonus trick (in addition to the bonus tricks gained from the hunter&#146;s effective druid level).</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a hunter can move at her normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. She takes only a -10 penalty (instead of the normal -20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Tree Stride (Sp): </b>At 10th level, a treestrider can use a full-round action to move between two trees, as per the spell tree stride. Unlike the spell, this ability has a duration of instantaneous and the treestrider can make only a single transfer. She can bring her animal companion with her, but if she does, her companion can&#146;t take any actions that round. Tree stride can be used a number of times per day equal to 3 + the hunter&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Speak with Master (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a hunter and her animal companion can communicate verbally, as if they were using a common language. Other creatures cannot understand the communication without magical aid.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Empathic Link (Su): </b>At 14th level, the range of the hunter&#146;s empathic link with her animal companion increases to 10 miles. If the animal companion is within 1 mile, the hunter can communicate with it telepathically.</p>
			<p><b>One with the Wild (Ex): </b>At 17th level, the hunter and her animal companion are respected or even feared by other animals, so long as the animals are approximately of the same type as any of the hunter&#146;s current animal foci: bat for bats, tiger with felines, falcon for birds, snake for reptiles, and so on. No animal in this category (including dire varieties) willingly attacks the hunter or her companion unless magically compelled to or if the hunter or companion attacks it first.</p>
			<p>The hunter and her companion can attempt to demoralize animals in the appropriate category as a swift action, rolling 1d20 and adding the hunter&#146;s level and her Charisma modifier to determine the Intimidate check result.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a hunter becomes a master hunter, able to track down foes with ease. She can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty.</p>
			<p>Additionally, each day when the hunter regains her spell slots, she chooses one animal focus to be active on herself for the entire day. This focus is in addition to using her animal focus class ability (including the additional focus ability she is able to use on herself if her animal companion is dead).</p>

					<p>In addition, a 7th-level totem-bonded&#146;s animal companion can grow further. If the animal companion&#146;s natural size is Large but it is normally available as a Medium animal companion at 7th level (such as a bear), the totembonded can have the companion increase in size. To generate statistics for such a creature, apply the following modifications: Size Large; AC +1 natural armor; Ability Scores Str +4, Dex &#150;2, Con +2.

					<p>At 1st level, the connection the totem-bonded has with her animal companion allows them to draw upon one another&#146;s strength. The totem-bonded can activate this ability as a swift action, and she can use it for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The effect ends immediately if the animal companion is ever more than 100 feet away from the totem-bonded.</p>
					<p>While the shared strength ability is active, the totembonded manifests one aspect of her animal companion drawn from the following list: low-light vision, scent, +1 bonus to natural armor, +10-foot bonus to speed, climb speed 30 feet, swim speed 40 feet, 2 claws (1d4), bite (1d6), gore (1d6), or slam (1d6); the natural attacks are all primary attacks, and the listed damage is for a Medium creature. The totem-bonded can select only a movement speed or natural attack that her animal companion also has, and an aspect cannot cause her speed or size to exceed that of her animal companion with this ability. At 8th level, the totem-bonded manifests two aspects of her animal companion, and she adds the following to her list of available aspects: +20-foot bonus to speed, fly speed 50 feet (average), increased size (as enlarge person), and powerful charge (doubles the damage dice dealt by the granted gore or slam attack). At 15th level, the damage dealt by any natural attacks granted by this ability increases by two die steps.</p>
					<p>A totem-bonded&#146;s animal companion also benefits from the shared strength ability, and while it is active, the animal understands the totem-bonded&#146;s known languages and can be pushed to perform an unfamiliar trick as a free action. At 8th level, the animal companion gains a +1 bonus on saving throws and a +2 bonus on checks with each skill in which it has at least 1 rank. At 15th level, the animal companion&#146;s bonuses on saving throws and skill checks increase to +2 and +4 respectively.</p>

					<p>A hunter can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Chapter 4 of the Core Rulebook). The hunter rolls 1d20 and adds her hunter level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
					<p>To use wild empathy, the hunter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, inf luencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
					<p>The hunter can also use this ability to inf luence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The Mammoth Lords coexist with the great primeval beasts that roam their lands, surviving with the help of the animals&#146; meat, hides, milk, bones, and more. These fearsome and wondrous animals have made their way into Kellid culture and tradition. Tribes are named after these creatures. Armor, clothing, weapons, and jewelry&#151;when not fashioned from bone, hide, or teeth harvested from these beasts&#151;are worked into images that evoke their shape and strength. They are even captured and trained for use as guardians, as hunters, or in the most iconic use, as mounts&#151;though they&#146;re rarely tamed, as the Mammoth Lords value the ferociousness of these creatures. The sight of a Mammoth Lord atop an elephantine steed is one that few soon forget.</i></p>
			<p><i>For some of the people of the Mammoth Lords, this adoration and respect for the megafauna that share their realm goes one step further. ShamansACG, oraclesAPG, druids, and others worship these animals as primal spirits of the world and draw great power from their faith. Others, like rangers and barbarians, are no less faithful in their belief, even though they focus more on physical combat than on spellcasting. Among the most devoted of these hunters are the so-called totem-bonded&#151;hunters who are able to form a true spiritual bond with the powerful fauna that dominate the wildlands. Such a hunter embraces one of the realm&#146;s megafauna as a sort of spiritual guide, eventually attracting a mighty beast that travels with her and helps keep her territory free of invaders. By doing so, the totem-bonded hunter becomes something more than merely a guardian and provider for her tribe&#151;she becomes a manifestation of the tribe&#146;s spiritual belief in the power of the land itself.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A hunter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A hunter casts divine spells drawn from the druid and ranger spell lists. Only druid spells of 6th level and lower and ranger spells are considered to be part of the hunter spell list. If a spell appears on both the druid and ranger spell lists, the hunter uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. For instance, reduce animal is a 2nd-level druid spell and a 3rd-level ranger spell, making it a 2nd-level hunter spell. Likewise, detect poison is a 0-level druid spell and a 2nd-level ranger spell, making it a 0-level hunter spell.</p>
			<p>The hunter can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a hunter must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a hunter&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the hunter&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>A hunter cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful Use Magic Device check) of druid spells of 7th level or higher. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells below.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a hunter can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-6: Hunter. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike druids and rangers, a hunter&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. A hunter begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new hunter level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a hunter knows is not affected by her Wisdom score; the numbers on Table 1-7 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by hunters as they gain levels, each hunter also automatically adds all summon nature&#146;s ally spells to her list of spells known. These spells are added as soon as the hunter is capable of casting them.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and at every 3 levels thereafter, a hunter can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the hunter loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A hunter may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any summon nature&#146;s ally spells.</p>
			<p>Unlike a druid or ranger, a hunter need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Hunters learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells: </b>A hunter can&#146;t cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity&#146;s (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Primeval Companion (Ex): </b>The totem-bonded adopts a powerful animal native to the region&#151;often one suited to the cold tundra&#151;selected from the following list: aurochs, badgerB2, bear, big cat, elkB3, giant ravenB6, mastodon, rhinoceros, walrusB4, wolf, or any creature categorized as megafauna. At the GM&#146;s discretion, she can select other animal companions.</p>
			<p>In addition, a 7th-level totem-bonded&#146;s animal companion can grow further. If the animal companion&#146;s natural size is Large but it is normally available as a Medium animal companion at 7th level (such as a bear), the totembonded can have the companion increase in size. To generate statistics for such a creature, apply the following modifications: Size Large; AC +1 natural armor; Ability Scores Str +4, Dex &#150;2, Con +2. Increase the damage of each of the companion&#146;s natural attacks by one die size.</p>
			<p><b>Shared Strength (Su): </b>At 1st level, the connection the totem-bonded has with her animal companion allows them to draw upon one another&#146;s strength. The totem-bonded can activate this ability as a swift action, and she can use it for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The effect ends immediately if the animal companion is ever more than 100 feet away from the totem-bonded.</p>
			<p>While the shared strength ability is active, the totembonded manifests one aspect of her animal companion drawn from the following list: low-light vision, scent, +1 bonus to natural armor, +10-foot bonus to speed, climb speed 30 feet, swim speed 40 feet, 2 claws (1d4), bite (1d6), gore (1d6), or slam (1d6); the natural attacks are all primary attacks, and the listed damage is for a Medium creature. The totem-bonded can select only a movement speed or natural attack that her animal companion also has, and an aspect cannot cause her speed or size to exceed that of her animal companion with this ability. At 8th level, the totem-bonded manifests two aspects of her animal companion, and she adds the following to her list of available aspects: +20-foot bonus to speed, fly speed 50 feet (average), increased size (as enlarge person), and powerful charge (doubles the damage dice dealt by the granted gore or slam attack). At 15th level, the damage dealt by any natural attacks granted by this ability increases by two die steps.</p>
			<p>A totem-bonded&#146;s animal companion also benefits from the shared strength ability, and while it is active, the animal understands the totem-bonded&#146;s known languages and can be pushed to perform an unfamiliar trick as a free action. At 8th level, the animal companion gains a +1 bonus on saving throws and a +2 bonus on checks with each skill in which it has at least 1 rank. At 15th level, the animal companion&#146;s bonuses on saving throws and skill checks increase to +2 and +4 respectively.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Training (Ex): </b>A hunter counts her total hunter level as both druid levels and ranger levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats, traits, and options that modify or improve an animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A hunter can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Chapter 4 of the Core Rulebook). The hunter rolls 1d20 and adds her hunter level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the hunter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, inf luencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The hunter can also use this ability to inf luence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Precise Companion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hunter chooses either Precise Shot or OutflankAPG as a bonus feat. She does not need to meet the prerequisites for this feat. If she chooses Outflank, she automatically grants this feat to her animal companion as well.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hunter adds 1/2 her level to Survival skill checks made to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Hunter Tactics (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, the hunter automatically grants her teamwork feats to her animal companion. The companion doesn&#146;t need to meet the prerequisites of these teamwork feats.</p>
			<p><b>Teamwork Feat: </b>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, the hunter gains a bonus teamwork feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. The hunter must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus teamwork feat.</p>
			<p>As a standard action, the hunter can choose to learn a new bonus teamwork feat in place of the most recent bonus teamwork feat she has already learned. In effect, the hunter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. She can change only the most recent teamwork feat gained, and must meet the prerequisites for the newly selected feat. A hunter can change her most recent teamwork feat a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Whenever she gains a new teamwork feat, her previous teamwork feats become permanent.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Empathic Link (Su): </b>At 4th level, the hunter gains an empathic link with her animal companion. This functions like an empathic link with a familiar, except the hunter can also see through a companion&#146;s eyes as a swift action, maintaining this connection as long as she likes (as long as the companion is within 1 mile) and ending it as a free action. The hunter is blinded while maintaining this connection.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a hunter and her animal companion may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at their normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion will still affect the hunter and her animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Tricks (Ex): </b>At 7th level and every 6 levels thereafter, a hunter&#146;s animal companion learns a bonus trick (in addition to the bonus tricks gained from the hunter&#146;s effective druid level).</p>
			<p><b>Second Animal Focus (Su): </b>At 8th level, whenever a hunter uses her animal focus ability, she selects two different animal aspects for herself instead of one, and can assign two aspects to her companion instead of one. As with the companion&#146;s previous aspect, the second one does not count against the minutes per day a hunter can take on an aspect.</p>
			<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead and the hunter has applied the companion&#146;s animal aspect to herself, that aspect does not count toward her maximum of two aspects at once. The hunter can still apply only one of her dead companion&#146;s aspects to herself, not both.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a hunter can move at her normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. She takes only a -10 penalty (instead of the normal -20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Raise Animal Companion (Sp): </b>At 10th level, a hunter gains raise animal companionUM as a spell-like ability; this is not restricted to raising only her own animal companion. Using this spell-like ability gives the hunter a permanent negative level. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration), but automatically ends after 24 hours. At 16th level, this functions as resurrection instead of raise dead, but otherwise operates as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Speak with Master (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a hunter and her animal companion can communicate verbally, as if they were using a common language. Other creatures cannot understand the communication without magical aid.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Empathic Link (Su): </b>At 14th level, the range of the hunter&#146;s empathic link with her animal companion increases to 10 miles. If the animal companion is within 1 mile, the hunter can communicate with it telepathically.</p>
			<p><b>One with the Wild (Ex): </b>At 17th level, the hunter and her animal companion are respected or even feared by other animals, so long as the animals are approximately of the same type as any of the hunter&#146;s current animal foci: bat for bats, tiger with felines, falcon for birds, snake for reptiles, and so on. No animal in this category (including dire varieties) willingly attacks the hunter or her companion unless magically compelled to or if the hunter or companion attacks it first.</p>
			<p>The hunter and her companion can attempt to demoralize animals in the appropriate category as a swift action, rolling 1d20 and adding the hunter&#146;s level and her Charisma modifier to determine the Intimidate check result.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a hunter becomes a master hunter, able to track down foes with ease. She can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty.</p>
			<p>Additionally, each day when the hunter regains her spell slots, she chooses one animal focus to be active on herself for the entire day. This focus is in addition to using her animal focus class ability (including the additional focus ability she is able to use on herself if her animal companion is dead).</p>

					<p>A hunter casts divine spells drawn from the druid and ranger spell lists. Only druid spells of 6th level and lower and ranger spells are considered to be part of the hunter spell list. If a spell appears on both the druid and ranger spell lists, the hunter uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. For instance, reduce animal is a 2nd-level druid spell and a 3rd-level ranger spell, making it a 2nd-level hunter spell. Likewise, detect poison is a 0-level druid spell and a 2nd-level ranger spell, making it a 0-level hunter spell.</p>
					<p>The hunter can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a hunter must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level.

				<name type="string">Animal Companion</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a hunter forms a bond with an animal companion. A hunter may begin play with any of the animals available to a druid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the hunter on her adventures. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the nature bond class feature). The hunter&#146;s effective druid level is equal to her hunter level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the companion&#146;s statistics and abilities. A hunter may teach her companion hunter&#146;s tricks from the skirmisher ranger archetype (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&#146;s Guide 128) instead of standard tricks. The animal companion can use skirmisher tricks when commanded, a number of times per day equal to half its Hit Dice plus its Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>If a hunter releases her companion from service or her animal companion perishes, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. While the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, any animal she summons with a summon nature&#146;s ally spell remains for 1 minute per level instead of 1 round per level. A hunter cannot have more than one summon nature&#146;s ally spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon nature&#146;s ally immediately ends.</p>

					<p>At 1st level, a hunter can take on the aspect of an animal as a swift action. She must select one type of animal to emulate, gaining a bonus or special ability based on the type of animal emulated and her hunter level. The hunter can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. The hunter can emulate only one animal at a time.</p>
					<p>The hunter can also apply one of these aspects to her animal companion. Unlike with the hunter herself, there is no duration on the animal aspect applied to her animal companion. An aspect applied in this way does not count against the hunter&#146;s minutes of duration per day-it remains in effect until the hunter changes it. The companion&#146;s aspect can be the same aspect the ranger has taken on or a different one. The hunter can select or change the animal foci on both herself and her animal companion as part of the same swift action.</p>
					<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, the hunter can apply her companion&#146;s animal focus to herself instead of her animal companion. This is in addition to the normal one she can choose, and (as with a companion&#146;s focus) remains in effect until the hunter changes it instead of counting against her minutes per day.</p>
					<p>A scarab stalker can select from the bull, falcon, and snake animal foci, as well as the following new animal foci.</p>
					<p>Bee: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Fly checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p>
					<p>Cat: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Acrobatics checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p>
					<p>Cow: The creature gains a +1 resistance bonus on Fortitude saving throws. This bonus increases to +2 at 8th level and +3 at 15th level.</p>
					<p>Crocodile: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Swim checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +3 at 15th level.</p>
					<p>Ibis: The creature gains a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against disease. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level.</p>
					<p>Jackal: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Survival checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p>
					<p>Kite: The creature recovers 1 additional hit point whenever it receives magical healing. This increases to 2 additional hit points at 8th level and 3 additional hit points at 15th level.</p>
					<p>Leopard: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Escape Artist checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p>
					<p>Lion: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Intimidate checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p>
					<p>Ram: The creature gains a +1 bonus on damage rolls when making charge attacks. This bonus increases to +2 at 8th level and +3 at 15th level.</p>
					<p>Scarab Beetle: The creature gains a +1 enhancement bonus to its natural armor bonus. This bonus increases to +2 at 8th level and +3 at 15th level.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, the hunter gains an empathic link with her animal companion. This functions like an empathic link with a familiar, except the hunter can also see through a companion&#146;s eyes as a swift action, maintaining this connection as long as she likes (as long as the companion is within 1 mile) and ending it as a free action. The hunter is blinded while maintaining this connection.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A hunter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A hunter casts divine spells drawn from the druid and ranger spell lists. Only druid spells of 6th level and lower and ranger spells are considered to be part of the hunter spell list. If a spell appears on both the druid and ranger spell lists, the hunter uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. For instance, reduce animal is a 2nd-level druid spell and a 3rd-level ranger spell, making it a 2nd-level hunter spell. Likewise, detect poison is a 0-level druid spell and a 2nd-level ranger spell, making it a 0-level hunter spell.</p>
			<p>The hunter can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a hunter must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a hunter&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the hunter&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>A hunter cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful Use Magic Device check) of druid spells of 7th level or higher. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells below.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a hunter can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-6: Hunter. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike druids and rangers, a hunter&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. A hunter begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new hunter level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a hunter knows is not affected by her Wisdom score; the numbers on Table 1-7 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by hunters as they gain levels, each hunter also automatically adds all summon nature&#146;s ally spells to her list of spells known. These spells are added as soon as the hunter is capable of casting them.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and at every 3 levels thereafter, a hunter can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the hunter loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A hunter may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any summon nature&#146;s ally spells.</p>
			<p>Unlike a druid or ranger, a hunter need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Hunters learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells: </b>A hunter can&#146;t cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity&#146;s (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Animal Companion (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a hunter forms a bond with an animal companion. A hunter may begin play with any of the animals available to a druid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the hunter on her adventures. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the nature bond class feature). The hunter&#146;s effective druid level is equal to her hunter level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the companion&#146;s statistics and abilities. A hunter may teach her companion hunter&#146;s tricks from the skirmisher ranger archetype (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&#146;s Guide 128) instead of standard tricks. The animal companion can use skirmisher tricks when commanded, a number of times per day equal to half its Hit Dice plus its Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>If a hunter releases her companion from service or her animal companion perishes, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. While the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, any animal she summons with a summon nature&#146;s ally spell remains for 1 minute per level instead of 1 round per level. A hunter cannot have more than one summon nature&#146;s ally spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon nature&#146;s ally immediately ends.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Training (Ex): </b>A hunter counts her total hunter level as both druid levels and ranger levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats, traits, and options that modify or improve an animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Sacred Animal Focus (Su): </b>A scarab stalker can select from the bull, falcon, and snake animal foci, as well as the following new animal foci.</p>
			<p>Bee: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Fly checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Cat: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Acrobatics checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Cow: The creature gains a +1 resistance bonus on Fortitude saving throws. This bonus increases to +2 at 8th level and +3 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Crocodile: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Swim checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +3 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Ibis: The creature gains a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against disease. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Jackal: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Survival checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Kite: The creature recovers 1 additional hit point whenever it receives magical healing. This increases to 2 additional hit points at 8th level and 3 additional hit points at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Leopard: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Escape Artist checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Lion: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Intimidate checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Ram: The creature gains a +1 bonus on damage rolls when making charge attacks. This bonus increases to +2 at 8th level and +3 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Scarab Beetle: The creature gains a +1 enhancement bonus to its natural armor bonus. This bonus increases to +2 at 8th level and +3 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Scorpion: The creature gains a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against poison. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Sha: The creature ignores the Perception penalty from sandstorms and can see twice as far in sandstorms. This increases to three times as far at 8th level and four times as far at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Uraeus: The creature gains a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against breath weapons. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A hunter can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Chapter 4 of the Core Rulebook). The hunter rolls 1d20 and adds her hunter level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the hunter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, inf luencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The hunter can also use this ability to inf luence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Precise Companion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hunter chooses either Precise Shot or OutflankAPG as a bonus feat. She does not need to meet the prerequisites for this feat. If she chooses Outflank, she automatically grants this feat to her animal companion as well.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hunter adds 1/2 her level to Survival skill checks made to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Hunter Tactics (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, the hunter automatically grants her teamwork feats to her animal companion. The companion doesn&#146;t need to meet the prerequisites of these teamwork feats.</p>
			<p><b>Teamwork Feat: </b>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, the hunter gains a bonus teamwork feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. The hunter must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus teamwork feat.</p>
			<p>As a standard action, the hunter can choose to learn a new bonus teamwork feat in place of the most recent bonus teamwork feat she has already learned. In effect, the hunter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. She can change only the most recent teamwork feat gained, and must meet the prerequisites for the newly selected feat. A hunter can change her most recent teamwork feat a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Whenever she gains a new teamwork feat, her previous teamwork feats become permanent.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Empathic Link (Su): </b>At 4th level, the hunter gains an empathic link with her animal companion. This functions like an empathic link with a familiar, except the hunter can also see through a companion&#146;s eyes as a swift action, maintaining this connection as long as she likes (as long as the companion is within 1 mile) and ending it as a free action. The hunter is blinded while maintaining this connection.</p>
			<p><b>Desert Walker (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a scarab stalker and her animal companion can move through desert terrain at normal speed without taking damage or suffering any other impairments unless that terrain has been enchanted or magically manipulated.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Tricks (Ex): </b>At 7th level and every 6 levels thereafter, a hunter&#146;s animal companion learns a bonus trick (in addition to the bonus tricks gained from the hunter&#146;s effective druid level).</p>
			<p><b>Second Animal Focus (Su): </b>At 8th level, whenever a hunter uses her animal focus ability, she selects two different animal aspects for herself instead of one, and can assign two aspects to her companion instead of one. As with the companion&#146;s previous aspect, the second one does not count against the minutes per day a hunter can take on an aspect.</p>
			<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead and the hunter has applied the companion&#146;s animal aspect to herself, that aspect does not count toward her maximum of two aspects at once. The hunter can still apply only one of her dead companion&#146;s aspects to herself, not both.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a hunter can move at her normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. She takes only a -10 penalty (instead of the normal -20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Raise Animal Companion (Sp): </b>At 10th level, a hunter gains raise animal companionUM as a spell-like ability; this is not restricted to raising only her own animal companion. Using this spell-like ability gives the hunter a permanent negative level. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration), but automatically ends after 24 hours. At 16th level, this functions as resurrection instead of raise dead, but otherwise operates as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Speak with Master (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a hunter and her animal companion can communicate verbally, as if they were using a common language. Other creatures cannot understand the communication without magical aid.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Empathic Link (Su): </b>At 14th level, the range of the hunter&#146;s empathic link with her animal companion increases to 10 miles. If the animal companion is within 1 mile, the hunter can communicate with it telepathically.</p>
			<p><b>One with the Wild (Ex): </b>At 17th level, the hunter and her animal companion are respected or even feared by other animals, so long as the animals are approximately of the same type as any of the hunter&#146;s current animal foci: bat for bats, tiger with felines, falcon for birds, snake for reptiles, and so on. No animal in this category (including dire varieties) willingly attacks the hunter or her companion unless magically compelled to or if the hunter or companion attacks it first.</p>
			<p>The hunter and her companion can attempt to demoralize animals in the appropriate category as a swift action, rolling 1d20 and adding the hunter&#146;s level and her Charisma modifier to determine the Intimidate check result.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a hunter becomes a master hunter, able to track down foes with ease. She can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty.</p>
			<p>Additionally, each day when the hunter regains her spell slots, she chooses one animal focus to be active on herself for the entire day. This focus is in addition to using her animal focus class ability (including the additional focus ability she is able to use on herself if her animal companion is dead).</p>

					<p>A hunter casts divine spells drawn from the druid and ranger spell lists. Only druid spells of 6th level and lower and ranger spells are considered to be part of the hunter spell list. If a spell appears on both the druid and ranger spell lists, the hunter uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. For instance, reduce animal is a 2nd-level druid spell and a 3rd-level ranger spell, making it a 2nd-level hunter spell. Likewise, detect poison is a 0-level druid spell and a 2nd-level ranger spell, making it a 0-level hunter spell.</p>
					<p>The hunter can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a hunter must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a hunter&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the hunter&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>A hunter cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful Use Magic Device check) of druid spells of 7th level or higher. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells below.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a hunter can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-6: Hunter. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>Unlike druids and rangers, a hunter&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. A hunter begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new hunter level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a hunter knows is not affected by her Wisdom score; the numbers on Table 1-7 are fixed.</p>
					<p>In addition to the spells gained by hunters as they gain levels, each hunter also automatically adds all summon nature&#146;s ally spells to her list of spells known. These spells are added as soon as the hunter is capable of casting them.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and at every 3 levels thereafter, a hunter can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the hunter loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A hunter may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any summon nature&#146;s ally spells.</p>
					<p>Unlike a druid or ranger, a hunter need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.</p>

				<name type="string">Animal Companion</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a hunter forms a bond with an animal companion. A hunter may begin play with any of the animals available to a druid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the hunter on her adventures. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the nature bond class feature). The hunter&#146;s effective druid level is equal to her hunter level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the companion&#146;s statistics and abilities. A hunter may teach her companion hunter&#146;s tricks from the skirmisher ranger archetype (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&#146;s Guide 128) instead of standard tricks. The animal companion can use skirmisher tricks when commanded, a number of times per day equal to half its Hit Dice plus its Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>If a hunter releases her companion from service or her animal companion perishes, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. While the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, any animal she summons with a summon nature&#146;s ally spell remains for 1 minute per level instead of 1 round per level. A hunter cannot have more than one summon nature&#146;s ally spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon nature&#146;s ally immediately ends.</p>

				<name type="string">Animal Focus</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a hunter can take on the aspect of an animal as a swift action. She must select one type of animal to emulate, gaining a bonus or special ability based on the type of animal emulated and her hunter level. The hunter can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. The hunter can emulate only one animal at a time.</p>
					<p>The hunter can also apply one of these aspects to her animal companion. Unlike with the hunter herself, there is no duration on the animal aspect applied to her animal companion. An aspect applied in this way does not count against the hunter&#146;s minutes of duration per day-it remains in effect until the hunter changes it. The companion&#146;s aspect can be the same aspect the ranger has taken on or a different one. The hunter can select or change the animal foci on both herself and her animal companion as part of the same swift action.</p>
					<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, the hunter can apply her companion&#146;s animal focus to herself instead of her animal companion. This is in addition to the normal one she can choose, and (as with a companion&#146;s focus) remains in effect until the hunter changes it instead of counting against her minutes per day.</p>

					<p>A hunter can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Chapter 4 of the Core Rulebook). The hunter rolls 1d20 and adds her hunter level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
					<p>To use wild empathy, the hunter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, inf luencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
					<p>The hunter can also use this ability to inf luence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Roof runners are skilled ambushers, skirmishers, and spies who eschew heavier types of armor in order to remain light on their feet. They lurk in the shadows of the rooftops to find people or houses to rob, though some use their specialized skills for nobler purposes.</i></p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A hunter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A hunter casts divine spells drawn from the druid and ranger spell lists. Only druid spells of 6th level and lower and ranger spells are considered to be part of the hunter spell list. If a spell appears on both the druid and ranger spell lists, the hunter uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. For instance, reduce animal is a 2nd-level druid spell and a 3rd-level ranger spell, making it a 2nd-level hunter spell. Likewise, detect poison is a 0-level druid spell and a 2nd-level ranger spell, making it a 0-level hunter spell.</p>
			<p>The hunter can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a hunter must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a hunter&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the hunter&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>A hunter cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful Use Magic Device check) of druid spells of 7th level or higher. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells below.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a hunter can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-6: Hunter. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike druids and rangers, a hunter&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. A hunter begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new hunter level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a hunter knows is not affected by her Wisdom score; the numbers on Table 1-7 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by hunters as they gain levels, each hunter also automatically adds all summon nature&#146;s ally spells to her list of spells known. These spells are added as soon as the hunter is capable of casting them.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and at every 3 levels thereafter, a hunter can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the hunter loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A hunter may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any summon nature&#146;s ally spells.</p>
			<p>Unlike a druid or ranger, a hunter need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Hunters learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells: </b>A hunter can&#146;t cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity&#146;s (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Animal Companion (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a hunter forms a bond with an animal companion. A hunter may begin play with any of the animals available to a druid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the hunter on her adventures. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the nature bond class feature). The hunter&#146;s effective druid level is equal to her hunter level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the companion&#146;s statistics and abilities. A hunter may teach her companion hunter&#146;s tricks from the skirmisher ranger archetype (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&#146;s Guide 128) instead of standard tricks. The animal companion can use skirmisher tricks when commanded, a number of times per day equal to half its Hit Dice plus its Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>If a hunter releases her companion from service or her animal companion perishes, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. While the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, any animal she summons with a summon nature&#146;s ally spell remains for 1 minute per level instead of 1 round per level. A hunter cannot have more than one summon nature&#146;s ally spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon nature&#146;s ally immediately ends.</p>
			<p><b>Animal Focus (Su): </b>At 1st level, a hunter can take on the aspect of an animal as a swift action. She must select one type of animal to emulate, gaining a bonus or special ability based on the type of animal emulated and her hunter level. The hunter can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. The hunter can emulate only one animal at a time.</p>
			<p>The hunter can also apply one of these aspects to her animal companion. Unlike with the hunter herself, there is no duration on the animal aspect applied to her animal companion. An aspect applied in this way does not count against the hunter&#146;s minutes of duration per day-it remains in effect until the hunter changes it. The companion&#146;s aspect can be the same aspect the ranger has taken on or a different one. The hunter can select or change the animal foci on both herself and her animal companion as part of the same swift action.</p>
			<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, the hunter can apply her companion&#146;s animal focus to herself instead of her animal companion. This is in addition to the normal one she can choose, and (as with a companion&#146;s focus) remains in effect until the hunter changes it instead of counting against her minutes per day.</p>
			<p>See the Hunter Animal Focuses section for a full list of Focuses from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Training (Ex): </b>A hunter counts her total hunter level as both druid levels and ranger levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats, traits, and options that modify or improve an animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A hunter can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Chapter 4 of the Core Rulebook). The hunter rolls 1d20 and adds her hunter level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the hunter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, inf luencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The hunter can also use this ability to inf luence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Precise Companion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hunter chooses either Precise Shot or OutflankAPG as a bonus feat. She does not need to meet the prerequisites for this feat. If she chooses Outflank, she automatically grants this feat to her animal companion as well.</p>
			<p><b>Natural Leaper (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a roof runner adds half her hunter level on Acrobatics checks to jump.</p>
			<p><b>Hunter Tactics (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, the hunter automatically grants her teamwork feats to her animal companion. The companion doesn&#146;t need to meet the prerequisites of these teamwork feats.</p>
			<p><b>Teamwork Feat: </b>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, the hunter gains a bonus teamwork feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. The hunter must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus teamwork feat.</p>
			<p>As a standard action, the hunter can choose to learn a new bonus teamwork feat in place of the most recent bonus teamwork feat she has already learned. In effect, the hunter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. She can change only the most recent teamwork feat gained, and must meet the prerequisites for the newly selected feat. A hunter can change her most recent teamwork feat a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Whenever she gains a new teamwork feat, her previous teamwork feats become permanent.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Empathic Link (Su): </b>At 4th level, the hunter gains an empathic link with her animal companion. This functions like an empathic link with a familiar, except the hunter can also see through a companion&#146;s eyes as a swift action, maintaining this connection as long as she likes (as long as the companion is within 1 mile) and ending it as a free action. The hunter is blinded while maintaining this connection.</p>
			<p><b>Shingle Stride (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a roof runner and her animal companion can move at full speed without penalty when using Acrobatics to cross narrow or uneven surfaces, and climb at half speed (instead of one-quarter speed) without taking the &#150; 5 penalty.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion will still affect the hunter and her animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Tricks (Ex): </b>At 7th level and every 6 levels thereafter, a hunter&#146;s animal companion learns a bonus trick (in addition to the bonus tricks gained from the hunter&#146;s effective druid level).</p>
			<p><b>Second Animal Focus (Su): </b>At 8th level, whenever a hunter uses her animal focus ability, she selects two different animal aspects for herself instead of one, and can assign two aspects to her companion instead of one. As with the companion&#146;s previous aspect, the second one does not count against the minutes per day a hunter can take on an aspect.</p>
			<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead and the hunter has applied the companion&#146;s animal aspect to herself, that aspect does not count toward her maximum of two aspects at once. The hunter can still apply only one of her dead companion&#146;s aspects to herself, not both.</p>
			<p><b>Alley Ghost (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a roof runner gains the benefits of the fast stealth rogue talent.</p>
			<p><b>Raise Animal Companion (Sp): </b>At 10th level, a hunter gains raise animal companionUM as a spell-like ability; this is not restricted to raising only her own animal companion. Using this spell-like ability gives the hunter a permanent negative level. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration), but automatically ends after 24 hours. At 16th level, this functions as resurrection instead of raise dead, but otherwise operates as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Speak with Master (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a hunter and her animal companion can communicate verbally, as if they were using a common language. Other creatures cannot understand the communication without magical aid.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Empathic Link (Su): </b>At 14th level, the range of the hunter&#146;s empathic link with her animal companion increases to 10 miles. If the animal companion is within 1 mile, the hunter can communicate with it telepathically.</p>
			<p><b>One with the Wild (Ex): </b>At 17th level, the hunter and her animal companion are respected or even feared by other animals, so long as the animals are approximately of the same type as any of the hunter&#146;s current animal foci: bat for bats, tiger with felines, falcon for birds, snake for reptiles, and so on. No animal in this category (including dire varieties) willingly attacks the hunter or her companion unless magically compelled to or if the hunter or companion attacks it first.</p>
			<p>The hunter and her companion can attempt to demoralize animals in the appropriate category as a swift action, rolling 1d20 and adding the hunter&#146;s level and her Charisma modifier to determine the Intimidate check result.</p>
			<p><b>Master Climber (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a roof runner gains a climb speed equal to her base land speed, instead of being able to move at full speed while tracking.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At first level, a primal companion hunter can awaken a primal creature from within his animal companion as a swift action. The animal companion gains a pool of 2 evolution points (Advanced Player&#146;s Guide 60) that can be used to temporarily give the companion evolutions as if it were an eidolon. A primal companion hunter uses her hunter level to determine her effective summoner level for the purpose of qualifying for evolutions and determining their effects. At 8th level, the number of evolution points in her pool increases to 4, and at 15th level, it increases to 6.</p>
					<p>Activating these evolutions on the animal companion is a swift action. A primal companion hunter can use this ability for 1 minute per day per hunter level. This duration need not to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. An animal companion transformed in this way cannot exceed the maximum number of attacks available to the eidolon of a summoner whose class level equals that of the hunter. While transformed in this way, the animal companion&#146;s type changes to magical beast, though the primal companion hunter still treats it as an animal for the purpose of the Handle Animal skill.</p>
					<p>If a primal companion hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, she can apply these evolutions to herself instead of to her animal companion. Uses of this ability count toward the hunter&#146;s maximum daily duration of evolution use. This ability replaces animal focus.</p>

					<p>At 8th level, once per day as a swift action, a primal companion hunter can touch her animal companion and grant it one evolution that costs up to 4 evolution points. The companion must meet the prerequisites of the selected evolution. Unlike the evolutions from primal transformation, this evolution is not set; it can be changed each time the hunter uses this ability. Using primal surge activates the primal transformation ability on the companion if it isn&#146;t already active. This effect lasts until the hunter ends the primal transformation. This does not allow a companion to exceed its maximum number of natural attacks.</p>
					<p>This ability can grant only one evolution at a time, even if the chosen evolution could be selected multiple times.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Most hunters are skilled at awakening the primal beasts inside themselves. However, some can instead activate the primal essence within their animal companion. These primal companion hunters bestow upon their companions the ability to suddenly manifest new and terrifying powers&#151;throwbacks to long-extinct beasts, bizarre mutations from extreme environments, or new abilities crafted from generations of selective breeding.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Hunters are warriors of the wilds that have forged close bonds with trusted animal companions. They focus their tactics on fighting alongside their companion animals as a formidable team of two. Able to cast a wide variety of nature spells and take on the abilities and attributes of beasts, hunters magically improve both themselves and their animal companions.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Hunters can adapt their tactics to many kinds of opponents, and cherish their highly trained animal companions. As a team, the hunter and her companion can react to danger with incredible speed, making them excellent scouts, explorers, and saboteurs.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any neutral.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Druid and ranger.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Hunter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A hunter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A hunter casts divine spells drawn from the druid and ranger spell lists. Only druid spells of 6th level and lower and ranger spells are considered to be part of the hunter spell list. If a spell appears on both the druid and ranger spell lists, the hunter uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. For instance, reduce animal is a 2nd-level druid spell and a 3rd-level ranger spell, making it a 2nd-level hunter spell. Likewise, detect poison is a 0-level druid spell and a 2nd-level ranger spell, making it a 0-level hunter spell.</p>
			<p>The hunter can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a hunter must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a hunter&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the hunter&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>A hunter cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful Use Magic Device check) of druid spells of 7th level or higher. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells below.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a hunter can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-6: Hunter. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike druids and rangers, a hunter&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. A hunter begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new hunter level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a hunter knows is not affected by her Wisdom score; the numbers on Table 1-7 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by hunters as they gain levels, each hunter also automatically adds all summon nature&#146;s ally spells to her list of spells known. These spells are added as soon as the hunter is capable of casting them.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and at every 3 levels thereafter, a hunter can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the hunter loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A hunter may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any summon nature&#146;s ally spells.</p>
			<p>Unlike a druid or ranger, a hunter need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Hunters learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells: </b>A hunter can&#146;t cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity&#146;s (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Animal Companion (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a hunter forms a bond with an animal companion. A hunter may begin play with any of the animals available to a druid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the hunter on her adventures. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the nature bond class feature). The hunter&#146;s effective druid level is equal to her hunter level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the companion&#146;s statistics and abilities. A hunter may teach her companion hunter&#146;s tricks from the skirmisher ranger archetype (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&#146;s Guide 128) instead of standard tricks. The animal companion can use skirmisher tricks when commanded, a number of times per day equal to half its Hit Dice plus its Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>If a hunter releases her companion from service or her animal companion perishes, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. While the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, any animal she summons with a summon nature&#146;s ally spell remains for 1 minute per level instead of 1 round per level. A hunter cannot have more than one summon nature&#146;s ally spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon nature&#146;s ally immediately ends.</p>
			<p><b>Primal Transformation (Su): </b>At first level, a primal companion hunter can awaken a primal creature from within his animal companion as a swift action. The animal companion gains a pool of 2 evolution points (Advanced Player&#146;s Guide 60) that can be used to temporarily give the companion evolutions as if it were an eidolon. A primal companion hunter uses her hunter level to determine her effective summoner level for the purpose of qualifying for evolutions and determining their effects. At 8th level, the number of evolution points in her pool increases to 4, and at 15th level, it increases to 6.</p>
			<p>Activating these evolutions on the animal companion is a swift action. A primal companion hunter can use this ability for 1 minute per day per hunter level. This duration need not to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. An animal companion transformed in this way cannot exceed the maximum number of attacks available to the eidolon of a summoner whose class level equals that of the hunter. While transformed in this way, the animal companion&#146;s type changes to magical beast, though the primal companion hunter still treats it as an animal for the purpose of the Handle Animal skill.</p>
			<p>If a primal companion hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, she can apply these evolutions to herself instead of to her animal companion. Uses of this ability count toward the hunter&#146;s maximum daily duration of evolution use. This ability replaces animal focus.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Training (Ex): </b>A hunter counts her total hunter level as both druid levels and ranger levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats, traits, and options that modify or improve an animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A hunter can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Chapter 4 of the Core Rulebook). The hunter rolls 1d20 and adds her hunter level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the hunter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, inf luencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The hunter can also use this ability to inf luence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Precise Companion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hunter chooses either Precise Shot or OutflankAPG as a bonus feat. She does not need to meet the prerequisites for this feat. If she chooses Outflank, she automatically grants this feat to her animal companion as well.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hunter adds 1/2 her level to Survival skill checks made to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Hunter Tactics (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, the hunter automatically grants her teamwork feats to her animal companion. The companion doesn&#146;t need to meet the prerequisites of these teamwork feats.</p>
			<p><b>Teamwork Feat: </b>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, the hunter gains a bonus teamwork feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. The hunter must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus teamwork feat.</p>
			<p>As a standard action, the hunter can choose to learn a new bonus teamwork feat in place of the most recent bonus teamwork feat she has already learned. In effect, the hunter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. She can change only the most recent teamwork feat gained, and must meet the prerequisites for the newly selected feat. A hunter can change her most recent teamwork feat a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Whenever she gains a new teamwork feat, her previous teamwork feats become permanent.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Empathic Link (Su): </b>At 4th level, the hunter gains an empathic link with her animal companion. This functions like an empathic link with a familiar, except the hunter can also see through a companion&#146;s eyes as a swift action, maintaining this connection as long as she likes (as long as the companion is within 1 mile) and ending it as a free action. The hunter is blinded while maintaining this connection.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a hunter and her animal companion may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at their normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion will still affect the hunter and her animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Tricks (Ex): </b>At 7th level and every 6 levels thereafter, a hunter&#146;s animal companion learns a bonus trick (in addition to the bonus tricks gained from the hunter&#146;s effective druid level).</p>
			<p><b>Primal Surge (Su): </b>At 8th level, once per day as a swift action, a primal companion hunter can touch her animal companion and grant it one evolution that costs up to 4 evolution points. The companion must meet the prerequisites of the selected evolution. Unlike the evolutions from primal transformation, this evolution is not set; it can be changed each time the hunter uses this ability. Using primal surge activates the primal transformation ability on the companion if it isn&#146;t already active. This effect lasts until the hunter ends the primal transformation. This does not allow a companion to exceed its maximum number of natural attacks.</p>
			<p>This ability can grant only one evolution at a time, even if the chosen evolution could be selected multiple times.</p>
			<p>This ability can grant an evolution that allows additional evolution points to be spent to upgrade that evolution (such as damage reduction or flight), and any points left over can be spent on such upgrades. This ability cannot be used to grant an upgrade to an evolution that the companion already possesses. This ability replaces second animal focus.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a hunter can move at her normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. She takes only a -10 penalty (instead of the normal -20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Raise Animal Companion (Sp): </b>At 10th level, a hunter gains raise animal companionUM as a spell-like ability; this is not restricted to raising only her own animal companion. Using this spell-like ability gives the hunter a permanent negative level. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration), but automatically ends after 24 hours. At 16th level, this functions as resurrection instead of raise dead, but otherwise operates as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Speak with Master (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a hunter and her animal companion can communicate verbally, as if they were using a common language. Other creatures cannot understand the communication without magical aid.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Empathic Link (Su): </b>At 14th level, the range of the hunter&#146;s empathic link with her animal companion increases to 10 miles. If the animal companion is within 1 mile, the hunter can communicate with it telepathically.</p>
			<p><b>One with the Wild (Ex): </b>At 17th level, the hunter and her animal companion are respected or even feared by other animals, so long as the animals are approximately of the same type as any of the hunter&#146;s current animal foci: bat for bats, tiger with felines, falcon for birds, snake for reptiles, and so on. No animal in this category (including dire varieties) willingly attacks the hunter or her companion unless magically compelled to or if the hunter or companion attacks it first.</p>
			<p>The hunter and her companion can attempt to demoralize animals in the appropriate category as a swift action, rolling 1d20 and adding the hunter&#146;s level and her Charisma modifier to determine the Intimidate check result.</p>
			<p><b>Primal Master (Su): </b>At 20th level, a primal companion hunter becomes in tune with his primal nature. He can activate his companion&#146;s primal aspect as a free action. When using primal surge, he can grant his companion two evolutions instead of one (each costing up to 4 evolution points). This ability replaces master hunter.</p>

					<p>A hunter casts divine spells drawn from the druid and ranger spell lists. Only druid spells of 6th level and lower and ranger spells are considered to be part of the hunter spell list. If a spell appears on both the druid and ranger spell lists, the hunter uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. For instance, reduce animal is a 2nd-level druid spell and a 3rd-level ranger spell, making it a 2nd-level hunter spell. Likewise, detect poison is a 0-level druid spell and a 2nd-level ranger spell, making it a 0-level hunter spell.</p>
					<p>The hunter can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a hunter must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a hunter&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the hunter&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>A hunter cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful Use Magic Device check) of druid spells of 7th level or higher. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells below.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a hunter can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-6: Hunter. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>Unlike druids and rangers, a hunter&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. A hunter begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new hunter level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a hunter knows is not affected by her Wisdom score; the numbers on Table 1-7 are fixed.</p>
					<p>In addition to the spells gained by hunters as they gain levels, each hunter also automatically adds all summon nature&#146;s ally spells to her list of spells known. These spells are added as soon as the hunter is capable of casting them.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and at every 3 levels thereafter, a hunter can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the hunter loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A hunter may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any summon nature&#146;s ally spells.</p>
					<p>Unlike a druid or ranger, a hunter need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.</p>

					<p>A plant master can take on the aspect of a plant as a swift action. He must select one type of plant to emulate, gaining a bonus or special ability based on the type of plant emulated and his hunter level. The plant master can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to his level. This duration does not need to be consecutive but must be spent in 1-minute increments. He can emulate only one plant at a time.</p>
					<p>The plant master can also apply one of these aspects to his plant companion. An aspect applied in this way does not count against the hunter&#146;s minutes of duration per day&#151;it remains in effect until he changes it. The companion&#146;s aspect can be the same aspect the hunter has taken on or a different one. A plant master can select or change the plant foci on both himself and his plant companion as part of the same swift action.</p>

					<p>Creeping Vine: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Climb checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p>

The plant master rolls 1d20 and adds his hunter level and his Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical wild plant creature has a starting attitude of indifferent. To use green empathy, the plant master and the plant creature must be within 30 feet of each other under normal conditions. Generally, influencing a plant creature in this way takes 1 minute, but as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some hunters form a bond with plant life instead of an animal and take on those aspects instead. These hunters form potent bonds with plant creatures, and their leafy or fungal friends are more than capable of anything another hunter&#146;s animal allies can accomplish.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Hunters are warriors of the wilds that have forged close bonds with trusted animal companions. They focus their tactics on fighting alongside their companion animals as a formidable team of two. Able to cast a wide variety of nature spells and take on the abilities and attributes of beasts, hunters magically improve both themselves and their animal companions.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Hunters can adapt their tactics to many kinds of opponents, and cherish their highly trained animal companions. As a team, the hunter and her companion can react to danger with incredible speed, making them excellent scouts, explorers, and saboteurs.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any neutral.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Druid and ranger.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Hunter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A hunter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A hunter casts divine spells drawn from the druid and ranger spell lists. Only druid spells of 6th level and lower and ranger spells are considered to be part of the hunter spell list. If a spell appears on both the druid and ranger spell lists, the hunter uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. For instance, reduce animal is a 2nd-level druid spell and a 3rd-level ranger spell, making it a 2nd-level hunter spell. Likewise, detect poison is a 0-level druid spell and a 2nd-level ranger spell, making it a 0-level hunter spell.</p>
			<p>The hunter can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a hunter must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a hunter&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the hunter&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>A hunter cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful Use Magic Device check) of druid spells of 7th level or higher. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells below.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a hunter can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-6: Hunter. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike druids and rangers, a hunter&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. A hunter begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new hunter level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a hunter knows is not affected by her Wisdom score; the numbers on Table 1-7 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by hunters as they gain levels, each hunter also automatically adds all summon nature&#146;s ally spells to her list of spells known. These spells are added as soon as the hunter is capable of casting them.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and at every 3 levels thereafter, a hunter can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the hunter loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A hunter may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any summon nature&#146;s ally spells.</p>
			<p>Unlike a druid or ranger, a hunter need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Hunters learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells: </b>A hunter can&#146;t cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity&#146;s (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Plant Companion (Ex): </b>A plant master forms a mystic bond with a plant companion. A plant master can begin play with any plant companion (see page 182 and page 26 of the Pathfinder RPG Advanced Race Guide). Except for the companion being a creature of the plant type, this ability otherwise works like the druid&#146;s animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Plant Focus (Su): </b>A plant master can take on the aspect of a plant as a swift action. He must select one type of plant to emulate, gaining a bonus or special ability based on the type of plant emulated and his hunter level. The plant master can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to his level. This duration does not need to be consecutive but must be spent in 1-minute increments. He can emulate only one plant at a time.</p>
			<p>The plant master can also apply one of these aspects to his plant companion. An aspect applied in this way does not count against the hunter&#146;s minutes of duration per day&#151;it remains in effect until he changes it. The companion&#146;s aspect can be the same aspect the hunter has taken on or a different one. A plant master can select or change the plant foci on both himself and his plant companion as part of the same swift action.</p>
			<p>Assassin Vine: The creature gains a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to grapple. This bonus increases to +3 at 8th level and +4 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Brambles: When the creature is hit by an unarmed strike or natural attack, the attacker takes 1 point of piercing damage. This increases to 2 points at 8th level and 3 points at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Creeping Vine: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Climb checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Giant Flytrap: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Stealth checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Mushroom: The creature gains a +4 enhancement bonus on saves against poison. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Oak: The creature gains a +2 enhancement bonus to CMD. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Shrieker: The creature gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet. At 8th level, the range increases by 30 feet. At 15th level, the creature also gains blindsense with a range of 10 feet.</p>
			<p>Spore: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Fly checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Water Lily: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Swim checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Training (Ex): </b>A hunter counts her total hunter level as both druid levels and ranger levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats, traits, and options that modify or improve an animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Green Empathy (Ex): </b>A plant master can improve the attitude of a plant creature. Green empathy functions like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person. The plant master rolls 1d20 and adds his hunter level and his Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical wild plant creature has a starting attitude of indifferent. To use green empathy, the plant master and the plant creature must be within 30 feet of each other under normal conditions. Generally, influencing a plant creature in this way takes 1 minute, but as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>A plant master can also use this ability to influence an animal, but he takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check. He has no ability to influence magical beasts.</p>
			<p><b>Precise Companion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hunter chooses either Precise Shot or OutflankAPG as a bonus feat. She does not need to meet the prerequisites for this feat. If she chooses Outflank, she automatically grants this feat to her animal companion as well.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hunter adds 1/2 her level to Survival skill checks made to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Hunter Tactics (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, the hunter automatically grants her teamwork feats to her animal companion. The companion doesn&#146;t need to meet the prerequisites of these teamwork feats.</p>
			<p><b>Teamwork Feat: </b>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, the hunter gains a bonus teamwork feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. The hunter must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus teamwork feat.</p>
			<p>As a standard action, the hunter can choose to learn a new bonus teamwork feat in place of the most recent bonus teamwork feat she has already learned. In effect, the hunter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. She can change only the most recent teamwork feat gained, and must meet the prerequisites for the newly selected feat. A hunter can change her most recent teamwork feat a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Whenever she gains a new teamwork feat, her previous teamwork feats become permanent.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Empathic Link (Su): </b>At 4th level, the hunter gains an empathic link with her animal companion. This functions like an empathic link with a familiar, except the hunter can also see through a companion&#146;s eyes as a swift action, maintaining this connection as long as she likes (as long as the companion is within 1 mile) and ending it as a free action. The hunter is blinded while maintaining this connection.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a hunter and her animal companion may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at their normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion will still affect the hunter and her animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Tricks (Ex): </b>At 7th level and every 6 levels thereafter, a hunter&#146;s animal companion learns a bonus trick (in addition to the bonus tricks gained from the hunter&#146;s effective druid level).</p>
			<p><b>Second Animal Focus (Su): </b>At 8th level, whenever a hunter uses her animal focus ability, she selects two different animal aspects for herself instead of one, and can assign two aspects to her companion instead of one. As with the companion&#146;s previous aspect, the second one does not count against the minutes per day a hunter can take on an aspect.</p>
			<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead and the hunter has applied the companion&#146;s animal aspect to herself, that aspect does not count toward her maximum of two aspects at once. The hunter can still apply only one of her dead companion&#146;s aspects to herself, not both.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a hunter can move at her normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. She takes only a -10 penalty (instead of the normal -20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Raise Animal Companion (Sp): </b>At 10th level, a hunter gains raise animal companionUM as a spell-like ability; this is not restricted to raising only her own animal companion. Using this spell-like ability gives the hunter a permanent negative level. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration), but automatically ends after 24 hours. At 16th level, this functions as resurrection instead of raise dead, but otherwise operates as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Speak with Master (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a hunter and her animal companion can communicate verbally, as if they were using a common language. Other creatures cannot understand the communication without magical aid.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Empathic Link (Su): </b>At 14th level, the range of the hunter&#146;s empathic link with her animal companion increases to 10 miles. If the animal companion is within 1 mile, the hunter can communicate with it telepathically.</p>
			<p><b>Plant Shield (Ex): </b>At 17th level, a plant master and his companion are distasteful to plant creatures. Creatures of the plant type with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower will not willingly attack either the plant master or his companion unless magically compelled to do so or the plant master or his companion attacks the creature first.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>At 20th level, when a plant master prepares spells for the day, he chooses one plant focus to be active for the entire day.</p>

The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a hunter&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the hunter&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>A hunter cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful Use Magic Device check) of druid spells of 7th level or higher.

				<name type="string">Pelagic Companion</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a hunter forms a bond with an animal companion. A pelagic hunter must select an aquatic animal companion. A hunter may begin play with any of the animals available to a druid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the hunter on her adventures. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the nature bond class feature). The hunter&#146;s effective druid level is equal to her hunter level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the companion&#146;s statistics and abilities. A hunter may teach her companion hunter&#146;s tricks from the skirmisher ranger archetype (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&#146;s Guide 128) instead of standard tricks. The animal companion can use skirmisher tricks when commanded, a number of times per day equal to half its Hit Dice plus its Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>If a hunter releases her companion from service or her animal companion perishes, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. While the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, any animal she summons with a summon nature&#146;s ally spell remains for 1 minute per level instead of 1 round per level. A hunter cannot have more than one summon nature&#146;s ally spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon nature&#146;s ally immediately ends.</p>

					<p>At 1st level, a hunter can take on the aspect of an animal as a swift action. She must select one type of animal to emulate, gaining a bonus or special ability based on the type of animal emulated and her hunter level. The hunter can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. The hunter can emulate only one animal at a time.</p>
					<p>The hunter can also apply one of these aspects to her animal companion. Unlike with the hunter herself, there is no duration on the animal aspect applied to her animal companion. An aspect applied in this way does not count against the hunter&#146;s minutes of duration per day-it remains in effect until the hunter changes it. The companion&#146;s aspect can be the same aspect the ranger has taken on or a different one. The hunter can select or change the animal foci on both herself and her animal companion as part of the same swift action.</p>
					<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, the hunter can apply her companion&#146;s animal focus to herself instead of her animal companion. This is in addition to the normal one she can choose, and (as with a companion&#146;s focus) remains in effect until the hunter changes it instead of counting against her minutes per day.</p>
					<p>See the Hunter Animal Focuses section for a full list of Focuses from all sources.</p>
					<p>Unlike with a normal hunter&#146;s animal focus, pelagic focus allows the hunter to contact magical deep sea creatures instead of animals, using the options below instead of the normal hunter options. This alters animal focus.</p>
					<p>Aboleth: The creature gains a +1 morale bonus on saves against divine spells and spell-like abilities. This bonus increases to +2 at 8th level and +3 at 15th level.</p>
					<p>Cetus: The creature gains Lunge as a bonus feat. At 12th level, instead of gaining Lunge, the creature increases its reach by 5 feet.</p>
					<p>Charybdis: The creature&#146;s attacks ignore the first 5 points of hardness. This improves to ignore the first 7 points of hardness at 8th level and the first 10 points of hardness at 15th level.</p>
					<p>Deep One: The creature reduces pressure damage it takes (see page 48) by 10. At 12th level, the creature is immune to damage from changing pressure.</p>
					<p>Hippocampus: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Swim checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p>
					<p>Kraken: The creature gains the jet ability (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 298) with a speed equal to its unmodified base land speed or four times its swim speed (if it has one), whichever is higher. If it has a swim speed, at 8th level, the jet ability&#146;s speed increases to five times its swim speed, and at 15th level, the speed increases to seven times its swim speed.</p>
					<p>Reefclaw: The creature gains Diehard as a bonus feat. At 12th level, instead of gaining Diehard, the creature gains the ferocity ability (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 300).</p>
					<p>Scylla: The creature&#146;s attacks deal 1 point of bleed damage in addition to their normal damage. At 8th level, the bleed damage increases to 1d3, and at 15th level, it increases to 1d6.</p>
					<p>Sea Serpent: The creature is considered to be under a nondetection spell it cast on itself, with a caster level equal to the pelagic hunter&#146;s class level.</p>
					<p>Selkie: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Bluff checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p>
					<p>Shoggoth: The creature gains a +2 competence bonus on Perception checks and reduces the flanking bonuses of creatures flanking it by 1. This Perception bonus increases to +3 at 8th level and +4 at 15th level. At 12th level, the creature can&#146;t be flanked.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A hunter can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Chapter 4 of the Core Rulebook). The hunter rolls 1d20 and adds her hunter level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
					<p>To use wild empathy, the hunter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, inf luencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
					<p>The hunter can also use this ability to inf luence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A hunter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A hunter casts divine spells drawn from the druid and ranger spell lists. Only druid spells of 6th level and lower and ranger spells are considered to be part of the hunter spell list. If a spell appears on both the druid and ranger spell lists, the hunter uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. For instance, reduce animal is a 2nd-level druid spell and a 3rd-level ranger spell, making it a 2nd-level hunter spell. Likewise, detect poison is a 0-level druid spell and a 2nd-level ranger spell, making it a 0-level hunter spell.</p>
			<p>The hunter can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a hunter must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a hunter&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the hunter&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>A hunter cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful Use Magic Device check) of druid spells of 7th level or higher. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells below.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a hunter can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-6: Hunter. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike druids and rangers, a hunter&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. A hunter begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new hunter level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a hunter knows is not affected by her Wisdom score; the numbers on Table 1-7 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by hunters as they gain levels, each hunter also automatically adds all summon nature&#146;s ally spells to her list of spells known. These spells are added as soon as the hunter is capable of casting them.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and at every 3 levels thereafter, a hunter can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the hunter loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A hunter may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any summon nature&#146;s ally spells.</p>
			<p>Unlike a druid or ranger, a hunter need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Hunters learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells: </b>A hunter can&#146;t cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity&#146;s (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Animal Companion (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a hunter forms a bond with an animal companion. A pelagic hunter must select an aquatic animal companion. A hunter may begin play with any of the animals available to a druid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the hunter on her adventures. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the nature bond class feature). The hunter&#146;s effective druid level is equal to her hunter level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the companion&#146;s statistics and abilities. A hunter may teach her companion hunter&#146;s tricks from the skirmisher ranger archetype (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&#146;s Guide 128) instead of standard tricks. The animal companion can use skirmisher tricks when commanded, a number of times per day equal to half its Hit Dice plus its Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>If a hunter releases her companion from service or her animal companion perishes, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. While the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, any animal she summons with a summon nature&#146;s ally spell remains for 1 minute per level instead of 1 round per level. A hunter cannot have more than one summon nature&#146;s ally spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon nature&#146;s ally immediately ends.</p>
			<p><b>Pelagic Focus (Su): </b>Unlike with a normal hunter&#146;s animal focus, pelagic focus allows the hunter to contact magical deep sea creatures instead of animals, using the options below instead of the normal hunter options. This alters animal focus.</p>
			<p>Aboleth: The creature gains a +1 morale bonus on saves against divine spells and spell-like abilities. This bonus increases to +2 at 8th level and +3 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Cetus: The creature gains Lunge as a bonus feat. At 12th level, instead of gaining Lunge, the creature increases its reach by 5 feet.</p>
			<p>Charybdis: The creature&#146;s attacks ignore the first 5 points of hardness. This improves to ignore the first 7 points of hardness at 8th level and the first 10 points of hardness at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Deep One: The creature reduces pressure damage it takes (see page 48) by 10. At 12th level, the creature is immune to damage from changing pressure.</p>
			<p>Hippocampus: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Swim checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Kraken: The creature gains the jet ability (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 298) with a speed equal to its unmodified base land speed or four times its swim speed (if it has one), whichever is higher. If it has a swim speed, at 8th level, the jet ability&#146;s speed increases to five times its swim speed, and at 15th level, the speed increases to seven times its swim speed.</p>
			<p>Reefclaw: The creature gains Diehard as a bonus feat. At 12th level, instead of gaining Diehard, the creature gains the ferocity ability (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 300).</p>
			<p>Scylla: The creature&#146;s attacks deal 1 point of bleed damage in addition to their normal damage. At 8th level, the bleed damage increases to 1d3, and at 15th level, it increases to 1d6.</p>
			<p>Sea Serpent: The creature is considered to be under a nondetection spell it cast on itself, with a caster level equal to the pelagic hunter&#146;s class level.</p>
			<p>Selkie: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Bluff checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Shoggoth: The creature gains a +2 competence bonus on Perception checks and reduces the flanking bonuses of creatures flanking it by 1. This Perception bonus increases to +3 at 8th level and +4 at 15th level. At 12th level, the creature can&#146;t be flanked.</p>
			<p>Siyokoy: The creature&#146;s attacks deal 1 additional point of electricity damage. At 8th level, the electricity damage increases to 1d3, and at 15th level, it increases to 1d6.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Training (Ex): </b>A hunter counts her total hunter level as both druid levels and ranger levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats, traits, and options that modify or improve an animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A hunter can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Chapter 4 of the Core Rulebook). The hunter rolls 1d20 and adds her hunter level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the hunter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, inf luencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The hunter can also use this ability to inf luence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Precise Companion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hunter chooses either Precise Shot or OutflankAPG as a bonus feat. She does not need to meet the prerequisites for this feat. If she chooses Outflank, she automatically grants this feat to her animal companion as well.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hunter adds 1/2 her level to Survival skill checks made to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Hunter Tactics (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, the hunter automatically grants her teamwork feats to her animal companion. The companion doesn&#146;t need to meet the prerequisites of these teamwork feats.</p>
			<p><b>Teamwork Feat: </b>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, the hunter gains a bonus teamwork feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. The hunter must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus teamwork feat.</p>
			<p>As a standard action, the hunter can choose to learn a new bonus teamwork feat in place of the most recent bonus teamwork feat she has already learned. In effect, the hunter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. She can change only the most recent teamwork feat gained, and must meet the prerequisites for the newly selected feat. A hunter can change her most recent teamwork feat a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Whenever she gains a new teamwork feat, her previous teamwork feats become permanent.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Empathic Link (Su): </b>At 4th level, the hunter gains an empathic link with her animal companion. This functions like an empathic link with a familiar, except the hunter can also see through a companion&#146;s eyes as a swift action, maintaining this connection as long as she likes (as long as the companion is within 1 mile) and ending it as a free action. The hunter is blinded while maintaining this connection.</p>
			<p><b>Blood to Water (Su): </b>At 5th level, when a pelagic hunter or her animal companion bleeds underwater into the surrounding water (whether from piercing or slashing damage, a bleed effect, or another effect that causes blood to spill), the blood transmutes into ordinary water within 1 round. This prevents sharks and other predators with keen scent from being drawn to the pelagic hunter&#146;s position by the blood and makes it harder for such creatures to track her.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Tricks (Ex): </b>At 7th level and every 6 levels thereafter, a hunter&#146;s animal companion learns a bonus trick (in addition to the bonus tricks gained from the hunter&#146;s effective druid level).</p>
			<p><b>Second Animal Focus (Su): </b>At 8th level, whenever a hunter uses her animal focus ability, she selects two different animal aspects for herself instead of one, and can assign two aspects to her companion instead of one. As with the companion&#146;s previous aspect, the second one does not count against the minutes per day a hunter can take on an aspect.</p>
			<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead and the hunter has applied the companion&#146;s animal aspect to herself, that aspect does not count toward her maximum of two aspects at once. The hunter can still apply only one of her dead companion&#146;s aspects to herself, not both.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a hunter can move at her normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. She takes only a -10 penalty (instead of the normal -20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Raise Animal Companion (Sp): </b>At 10th level, a hunter gains raise animal companionUM as a spell-like ability; this is not restricted to raising only her own animal companion. Using this spell-like ability gives the hunter a permanent negative level. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration), but automatically ends after 24 hours. At 16th level, this functions as resurrection instead of raise dead, but otherwise operates as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Speak with Master (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a hunter and her animal companion can communicate verbally, as if they were using a common language. Other creatures cannot understand the communication without magical aid.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Empathic Link (Su): </b>At 14th level, the range of the hunter&#146;s empathic link with her animal companion increases to 10 miles. If the animal companion is within 1 mile, the hunter can communicate with it telepathically.</p>
			<p><b>One with the Wild (Ex): </b>At 17th level, the hunter and her animal companion are respected or even feared by other animals, so long as the animals are approximately of the same type as any of the hunter&#146;s current animal foci: bat for bats, tiger with felines, falcon for birds, snake for reptiles, and so on. No animal in this category (including dire varieties) willingly attacks the hunter or her companion unless magically compelled to or if the hunter or companion attacks it first.</p>
			<p>The hunter and her companion can attempt to demoralize animals in the appropriate category as a swift action, rolling 1d20 and adding the hunter&#146;s level and her Charisma modifier to determine the Intimidate check result.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a hunter becomes a master hunter, able to track down foes with ease. She can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty.</p>
			<p>Additionally, each day when the hunter regains her spell slots, she chooses one animal focus to be active on herself for the entire day. This focus is in addition to using her animal focus class ability (including the additional focus ability she is able to use on herself if her animal companion is dead).</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A hunter casts divine spells drawn from the druid and ranger spell lists. Only druid spells of 6th level and lower and ranger spells are considered to be part of the hunter spell list. If a spell appears on both the druid and ranger spell lists, the hunter uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. For instance, reduce animal is a 2nd-level druid spell and a 3rd-level ranger spell, making it a 2nd-level hunter spell. Likewise, detect poison is a 0-level druid spell and a 2nd-level ranger spell, making it a 0-level hunter spell.</p>
					<p>The hunter can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a hunter must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a hunter&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the hunter&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>A hunter cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful Use Magic Device check) of druid spells of 7th level or higher. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells below.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a hunter can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-6: Hunter. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>Unlike druids and rangers, a hunter&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. A hunter begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new hunter level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a hunter knows is not affected by her Wisdom score; the numbers on Table 1-7 are fixed.</p>
					<p>In addition to the spells gained by hunters as they gain levels, each hunter also automatically adds all summon nature&#146;s ally spells to her list of spells known. These spells are added as soon as the hunter is capable of casting them.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and at every 3 levels thereafter, a hunter can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the hunter loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A hunter may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any summon nature&#146;s ally spells.</p>
					<p>Unlike a druid or ranger, a hunter need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.</p>

					<p>At 1st level, a hunter can take on the aspect of an animal as a swift action. She must select one type of animal to emulate, gaining a bonus or special ability based on the type of animal emulated and her hunter level. The hunter can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. The hunter can emulate only one animal at a time.</p>
					<p>The hunter can also apply one of these aspects to her animal companion. Unlike with the hunter herself, there is no duration on the animal aspect applied to her animal companion. An aspect applied in this way does not count against the hunter&#146;s minutes of duration per day-it remains in effect until the hunter changes it. The companion&#146;s aspect can be the same aspect the ranger has taken on or a different one. The hunter can select or change the animal foci on both herself and her animal companion as part of the same swift action.</p>
					<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, the hunter can apply her companion&#146;s animal focus to herself instead of her animal companion. This is in addition to the normal one she can choose, and (as with a companion&#146;s focus) remains in effect until the hunter changes it instead of counting against her minutes per day.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Wandering the wilds, some hunters eschew the bond of innate teamwork with their animal companions. Instead, these hunters master the creation and deployment of intricate ranger traps, often using themselves or their animal companions to lure foes into their snares.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Hunters are warriors of the wilds that have forged close bonds with trusted animal companions. They focus their tactics on fighting alongside their companion animals as a formidable team of two. Able to cast a wide variety of nature spells and take on the abilities and attributes of beasts, hunters magically improve both themselves and their animal companions.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Hunters can adapt their tactics to many kinds of opponents, and cherish their highly trained animal companions. As a team, the hunter and her companion can react to danger with incredible speed, making them excellent scouts, explorers, and saboteurs.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any neutral.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Druid and ranger.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Hunter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Disable Device (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A hunter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A hunter casts divine spells drawn from the druid and ranger spell lists. Only druid spells of 6th level and lower and ranger spells are considered to be part of the hunter spell list. If a spell appears on both the druid and ranger spell lists, the hunter uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. For instance, reduce animal is a 2nd-level druid spell and a 3rd-level ranger spell, making it a 2nd-level hunter spell. Likewise, detect poison is a 0-level druid spell and a 2nd-level ranger spell, making it a 0-level hunter spell.</p>
			<p>The hunter can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a hunter must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a hunter&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the hunter&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>A hunter cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful Use Magic Device check) of druid spells of 7th level or higher. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells below.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a hunter can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-6: Hunter. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike druids and rangers, a hunter&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. A hunter begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new hunter level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a hunter knows is not affected by her Wisdom score; the numbers on Table 1-7 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by hunters as they gain levels, each hunter also automatically adds all summon nature&#146;s ally spells to her list of spells known. These spells are added as soon as the hunter is capable of casting them.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and at every 3 levels thereafter, a hunter can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the hunter loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A hunter may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any summon nature&#146;s ally spells.</p>
			<p>Unlike a druid or ranger, a hunter need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Hunters learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells: </b>A hunter can&#146;t cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity&#146;s (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Animal Companion (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a hunter forms a bond with an animal companion. A hunter may begin play with any of the animals available to a druid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the hunter on her adventures. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the nature bond class feature). The hunter&#146;s effective druid level is equal to her hunter level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the companion&#146;s statistics and abilities. A hunter may teach her companion hunter&#146;s tricks from the skirmisher ranger archetype (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&#146;s Guide 128) instead of standard tricks. The animal companion can use skirmisher tricks when commanded, a number of times per day equal to half its Hit Dice plus its Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>If a hunter releases her companion from service or her animal companion perishes, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. While the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, any animal she summons with a summon nature&#146;s ally spell remains for 1 minute per level instead of 1 round per level. A hunter cannot have more than one summon nature&#146;s ally spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon nature&#146;s ally immediately ends.</p>
			<p><b>Animal Focus (Su): </b>At 1st level, a hunter can take on the aspect of an animal as a swift action. She must select one type of animal to emulate, gaining a bonus or special ability based on the type of animal emulated and her hunter level. The hunter can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. The hunter can emulate only one animal at a time.</p>
			<p>The hunter can also apply one of these aspects to her animal companion. Unlike with the hunter herself, there is no duration on the animal aspect applied to her animal companion. An aspect applied in this way does not count against the hunter&#146;s minutes of duration per day-it remains in effect until the hunter changes it. The companion&#146;s aspect can be the same aspect the ranger has taken on or a different one. The hunter can select or change the animal foci on both herself and her animal companion as part of the same swift action.</p>
			<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, the hunter can apply her companion&#146;s animal focus to herself instead of her animal companion. This is in addition to the normal one she can choose, and (as with a companion&#146;s focus) remains in effect until the hunter changes it instead of counting against her minutes per day.</p>
			<p>See the Hunter Animal Focuses section for a full list of Focuses from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Trapfinding (Ex): </b>A patient ambusher adds half her hunter level (minimum +1) on Perception checks to locate traps and on Disable Device skill checks. A patient ambusher can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps.</p>
			<p><b>Precise Companion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hunter chooses either Precise Shot or OutflankAPG as a bonus feat. She does not need to meet the prerequisites for this feat. If she chooses Outflank, she automatically grants this feat to her animal companion as well.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hunter adds 1/2 her level to Survival skill checks made to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Additional Traps (Ex or Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 3 hunter levels thereafter, a patient ambusher can learn a new type of trap, selected from the list of ranger traps presented on pages 64&#150;65 of Ultimate Magic. Once a trap is learned, it can&#146;t be unlearned and replaced with a different type of trap. The patient ambusher cannot learn an individual trap more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Snare Trap (Ex or Su): </b>At 3rd level, a patient ambusher learns how to create a snare trap. The patient ambusher can use this and other learned traps a total number of times per day equal to half her hunter level + her Wisdom modifier. This snare trap otherwise functions the same as the ranger snare trap detailed in Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Empathic Link (Su): </b>At 4th level, the hunter gains an empathic link with her animal companion. This functions like an empathic link with a familiar, except the hunter can also see through a companion&#146;s eyes as a swift action, maintaining this connection as long as she likes (as long as the companion is within 1 mile) and ending it as a free action. The hunter is blinded while maintaining this connection.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a hunter and her animal companion may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at their normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion will still affect the hunter and her animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Tricks (Ex): </b>At 7th level and every 6 levels thereafter, a hunter&#146;s animal companion learns a bonus trick (in addition to the bonus tricks gained from the hunter&#146;s effective druid level).</p>
			<p><b>Second Animal Focus (Su): </b>At 8th level, whenever a hunter uses her animal focus ability, she selects two different animal aspects for herself instead of one, and can assign two aspects to her companion instead of one. As with the companion&#146;s previous aspect, the second one does not count against the minutes per day a hunter can take on an aspect.</p>
			<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead and the hunter has applied the companion&#146;s animal aspect to herself, that aspect does not count toward her maximum of two aspects at once. The hunter can still apply only one of her dead companion&#146;s aspects to herself, not both.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a hunter can move at her normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. She takes only a -10 penalty (instead of the normal -20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Launch Trap (Su): </b>At 10th level, a patient ambusher can affix a magical ranger trap to an arrow, a crossbow bolt, or a thrown weapon, allowing her to set the trap remotely or use it as a direct attack. Attaching the trap to the projectile is part of the full-round action to create a new trap. The trapped projectile is fired or thrown in the normal manner. If fired at a square, the trap is treated as if the hunter had set the trap in that square, except the DC is 5 lower than normal. If the trap is fired at a creature, the target takes damage from the ranged weapon and is treated as if it had triggered the trap (attempting a saving throw, if any). The attack has a maximum range of 60 feet, and penalties from range increments apply on the attack roll. The duration of the trap starts when it is created, not when it is triggered.</p>
			<p><b>Speak with Master (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a hunter and her animal companion can communicate verbally, as if they were using a common language. Other creatures cannot understand the communication without magical aid.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Empathic Link (Su): </b>At 14th level, the range of the hunter&#146;s empathic link with her animal companion increases to 10 miles. If the animal companion is within 1 mile, the hunter can communicate with it telepathically.</p>
			<p><b>One with the Wild (Ex): </b>At 17th level, the hunter and her animal companion are respected or even feared by other animals, so long as the animals are approximately of the same type as any of the hunter&#146;s current animal foci: bat for bats, tiger with felines, falcon for birds, snake for reptiles, and so on. No animal in this category (including dire varieties) willingly attacks the hunter or her companion unless magically compelled to or if the hunter or companion attacks it first.</p>
			<p>The hunter and her companion can attempt to demoralize animals in the appropriate category as a swift action, rolling 1d20 and adding the hunter&#146;s level and her Charisma modifier to determine the Intimidate check result.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a hunter becomes a master hunter, able to track down foes with ease. She can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty.</p>
			<p>Additionally, each day when the hunter regains her spell slots, she chooses one animal focus to be active on herself for the entire day. This focus is in addition to using her animal focus class ability (including the additional focus ability she is able to use on herself if her animal companion is dead).</p>

					<p>When a packmaster gains a level, she must decide how to allocate the increase among her animal companions, including whether or not to add a new 1st-level companion. Once a hunter level is allocated to a particular companion, it cannot be redistributed while that companion is in the packmaster&#146;s service. She must release the companion or wait until the companion dies to allocate its levels to another companion, which she can then do the next time she refreshes her spell slots for the day. The share spells animal companion ability applies to only one animal companion at a time&#151;the packmaster cannot use it to cast a spell that affects only a single target and have the spell affect all of her animal companions.</p>
					<p>A packmaster&#146;s precise companion, woodland stride, and teamwork feats apply to only one of her animal companions at a time. (For example, a packmaster can apply precise companion to one companion, woodland stride to another, and a given teamwork feat to a third, but cannot apply any of those to two animal companions at once.) As a swift action, she can change which companion gains any or all of these benefits. This ability replaces animal companion.</p>

				<name type="string">Pack Focus</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>This ability functions like animal focus, with the following exceptions. A packmaster can apply her animal aspect to only one of her animal companions at a time without it counting against the number of minutes per day she can use that ability. When using animal focus on herself or her other animal companion, the ability counts against her minutes per day as normal. She can have only two animal aspects in effect at a time&#151;one that counts against her minutes per day and one that doesn&#146;t&#151;and they can&#146;t both target the same companion. Unless both her companions are dead, the hunter can&#146;t apply the companion&#146;s aspect to herself (and thereby gain the benefit of its unlimited duration). This ability replaces animal focus.</p>

				<name type="string">Wild Empathy</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A hunter can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Chapter 4 of the Core Rulebook). The hunter rolls 1d20 and adds her hunter level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
					<p>To use wild empathy, the hunter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, inf luencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
					<p>The hunter can also use this ability to inf luence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some hunters form bonds with packs of well-trained creatures. Whether such a hunter is a northern berserker running with a pack of timber wolves or a savage warrior dashing through the jungle alongside her herd of dimetrodons, the packmaster revels in the thrill of the hunt and the glory of the kill. A packmaster is more comfortable in groups than alone, and although her animal companions may be weaker than a typical hunter&#146;s, what they lack in strength they make up for in numbers.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Hunters are warriors of the wilds that have forged close bonds with trusted animal companions. They focus their tactics on fighting alongside their companion animals as a formidable team of two. Able to cast a wide variety of nature spells and take on the abilities and attributes of beasts, hunters magically improve both themselves and their animal companions.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Hunters can adapt their tactics to many kinds of opponents, and cherish their highly trained animal companions. As a team, the hunter and her companion can react to danger with incredible speed, making them excellent scouts, explorers, and saboteurs.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any neutral.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Druid and ranger.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Hunter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A hunter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A hunter casts divine spells drawn from the druid and ranger spell lists. Only druid spells of 6th level and lower and ranger spells are considered to be part of the hunter spell list. If a spell appears on both the druid and ranger spell lists, the hunter uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. For instance, reduce animal is a 2nd-level druid spell and a 3rd-level ranger spell, making it a 2nd-level hunter spell. Likewise, detect poison is a 0-level druid spell and a 2nd-level ranger spell, making it a 0-level hunter spell.</p>
			<p>The hunter can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a hunter must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a hunter&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the hunter&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>A hunter cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful Use Magic Device check) of druid spells of 7th level or higher. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells below.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a hunter can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-6: Hunter. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike druids and rangers, a hunter&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. A hunter begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new hunter level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a hunter knows is not affected by her Wisdom score; the numbers on Table 1-7 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by hunters as they gain levels, each hunter also automatically adds all summon nature&#146;s ally spells to her list of spells known. These spells are added as soon as the hunter is capable of casting them.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and at every 3 levels thereafter, a hunter can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the hunter loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A hunter may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any summon nature&#146;s ally spells.</p>
			<p>Unlike a druid or ranger, a hunter need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Hunters learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells: </b>A hunter can&#146;t cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity&#146;s (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Pack Bond (Ex): </b>A packmaster can have more than one animal companion, but she must divide her effective druid level between her companions to determine the abilities of each one. For example, a 4th-level packmaster can have one 4th-level animal companion, two 2nd-level companions, one 3rd-level companion and one 1st-level companion, or four 1st-level companions.</p>
			<p>When a packmaster gains a level, she must decide how to allocate the increase among her animal companions, including whether or not to add a new 1st-level companion. Once a hunter level is allocated to a particular companion, it cannot be redistributed while that companion is in the packmaster&#146;s service. She must release the companion or wait until the companion dies to allocate its levels to another companion, which she can then do the next time she refreshes her spell slots for the day. The share spells animal companion ability applies to only one animal companion at a time&#151;the packmaster cannot use it to cast a spell that affects only a single target and have the spell affect all of her animal companions.</p>
			<p>A packmaster&#146;s precise companion, woodland stride, and teamwork feats apply to only one of her animal companions at a time. (For example, a packmaster can apply precise companion to one companion, woodland stride to another, and a given teamwork feat to a third, but cannot apply any of those to two animal companions at once.) As a swift action, she can change which companion gains any or all of these benefits. This ability replaces animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Pack Focus (Su): </b>This ability functions like animal focus, with the following exceptions. A packmaster can apply her animal aspect to only one of her animal companions at a time without it counting against the number of minutes per day she can use that ability. When using animal focus on herself or her other animal companion, the ability counts against her minutes per day as normal. She can have only two animal aspects in effect at a time&#151;one that counts against her minutes per day and one that doesn&#146;t&#151;and they can&#146;t both target the same companion. Unless both her companions are dead, the hunter can&#146;t apply the companion&#146;s aspect to herself (and thereby gain the benefit of its unlimited duration). This ability replaces animal focus.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Training (Ex): </b>A hunter counts her total hunter level as both druid levels and ranger levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats, traits, and options that modify or improve an animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A hunter can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Chapter 4 of the Core Rulebook). The hunter rolls 1d20 and adds her hunter level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the hunter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, inf luencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The hunter can also use this ability to inf luence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Precise Companion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hunter chooses either Precise Shot or OutflankAPG as a bonus feat. She does not need to meet the prerequisites for this feat. If she chooses Outflank, she automatically grants this feat to her animal companion as well.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hunter adds 1/2 her level to Survival skill checks made to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Hunter Tactics (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, the hunter automatically grants her teamwork feats to her animal companion. The companion doesn&#146;t need to meet the prerequisites of these teamwork feats.</p>
			<p><b>Teamwork Feat: </b>At 3rd level or any level at which a packmaster would gain a bonus teamwork feat, she can instead increase the number of her animal companions that gain the benefits of her precise companion, woodland stride, and teamwork feats by 1. She can select this ability multiple times. This ability alters teamwork feats.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Empathic Link (Su): </b>At 4th level, the hunter gains an empathic link with her animal companion. This functions like an empathic link with a familiar, except the hunter can also see through a companion&#146;s eyes as a swift action, maintaining this connection as long as she likes (as long as the companion is within 1 mile) and ending it as a free action. The hunter is blinded while maintaining this connection.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a hunter and her animal companion may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at their normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion will still affect the hunter and her animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Tricks (Ex): </b>At 7th level and every 6 levels thereafter, a hunter&#146;s animal companion learns a bonus trick (in addition to the bonus tricks gained from the hunter&#146;s effective druid level).</p>
			<p><b>Second Pack Focus (Su): </b>At 8th level, the hunter gains an ability that functions like the second animal focus, but the hunter can either assign each companion one aspect each or assign both aspects to the same companion. The foci on the companions don&#146;t need to be the same, nor do they need to be the same as the one assigned to the packmaster. This ability replaces second animal focus.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a hunter can move at her normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. She takes only a -10 penalty (instead of the normal -20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Raise Animal Companion (Sp): </b>At 10th level, a hunter gains raise animal companionUM as a spell-like ability; this is not restricted to raising only her own animal companion. Using this spell-like ability gives the hunter a permanent negative level. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration), but automatically ends after 24 hours. At 16th level, this functions as resurrection instead of raise dead, but otherwise operates as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Speak with Master (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a hunter and her animal companion can communicate verbally, as if they were using a common language. Other creatures cannot understand the communication without magical aid.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Empathic Link (Su): </b>At 14th level, the range of the hunter&#146;s empathic link with her animal companion increases to 10 miles. If the animal companion is within 1 mile, the hunter can communicate with it telepathically.</p>
			<p><b>One with the Wild (Ex): </b>At 17th level, the hunter and her animal companion are respected or even feared by other animals, so long as the animals are approximately of the same type as any of the hunter&#146;s current animal foci: bat for bats, tiger with felines, falcon for birds, snake for reptiles, and so on. No animal in this category (including dire varieties) willingly attacks the hunter or her companion unless magically compelled to or if the hunter or companion attacks it first.</p>
			<p>The hunter and her companion can attempt to demoralize animals in the appropriate category as a swift action, rolling 1d20 and adding the hunter&#146;s level and her Charisma modifier to determine the Intimidate check result.</p>
			<p><b>Master of the Pack (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a packmaster and her animal companions can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. Each day when a packmaster gains new spells for the day, she chooses one animal focus to be active on herself or one of her animal companions for the entire day (if all of her animal companions are dead, she instead chooses two animal foci to be active on herself for the entire day). This focus is in addition to her pack focus class ability. This ability replaces master hunter.</p>

					<p>A hunter casts divine spells drawn from the druid and ranger spell lists. Only druid spells of 6th level and lower and ranger spells are considered to be part of the hunter spell list. If a spell appears on both the druid and ranger spell lists, the hunter uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. For instance, reduce animal is a 2nd-level druid spell and a 3rd-level ranger spell, making it a 2nd-level hunter spell. Likewise, detect poison is a 0-level druid spell and a 2nd-level ranger spell, making it a 0-level hunter spell.</p>
					<p>The hunter can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a hunter must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a hunter&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the hunter&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>A hunter cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful Use Magic Device check) of druid spells of 7th level or higher. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells below.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a hunter can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-6: Hunter. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>Unlike druids and rangers, a hunter&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. A hunter begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new hunter level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a hunter knows is not affected by her Wisdom score; the numbers on Table 1-7 are fixed.</p>
					<p>In addition to the spells gained by hunters as they gain levels, each hunter also automatically adds all summon nature&#146;s ally spells to her list of spells known. These spells are added as soon as the hunter is capable of casting them.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and at every 3 levels thereafter, a hunter can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the hunter loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A hunter may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any summon nature&#146;s ally spells.</p>
					<p>Unlike a druid or ranger, a hunter need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.</p>

In addition, at each such interval, the bonuses on initiative checks and skill checks in one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired) increase by 2.

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>As a forester has no animal companion, the aspects granted by this ability always apply to the forester herself, just as if a normal hunter&#146;s companion were dead.</p>
					<p>At 1st level, a hunter can take on the aspect of an animal as a swift action. She must select one type of animal to emulate, gaining a bonus or special ability based on the type of animal emulated and her hunter level. The hunter can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. The hunter can emulate only one animal at a time.</p>
					<p>The hunter can also apply one of these aspects to her animal companion. Unlike with the hunter herself, there is no duration on the animal aspect applied to her animal companion. An aspect applied in this way does not count against the hunter&#146;s minutes of duration per day-it remains in effect until the hunter changes it. The companion&#146;s aspect can be the same aspect the ranger has taken on or a different one. The hunter can select or change the animal foci on both herself and her animal companion as part of the same swift action.</p>
					<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, the hunter can apply her companion&#146;s animal focus to herself instead of her animal companion. This is in addition to the normal one she can choose, and (as with a companion&#146;s focus) remains in effect until the hunter changes it instead of counting against her minutes per day.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>While all hunters have a bond with the natural world, a forester has a stronger tie to her environment than to the animals within it. While most foresters feel strong bonds with woodland regions, the archetype functions well in other terrains as well. In such cases, a forester might refer to herself by a different name that more accurately reflects her chosen terrain. For example, a forester who favors bogs and marshes might call herself a &#147;swamper,&#148; while one who favors frozen regions might call herself a &#147;glacier guardian.&#148; As foresters gain levels and take on new favored terrains, they often eschew such titles completely, viewing them as unnecessary, and merely refer to themselves as guardians of the wild or champions of nature&#146;s will&#151;but regardless of the name, their devotion remains.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Hunters are warriors of the wilds that have forged close bonds with trusted animal companions. They focus their tactics on fighting alongside their companion animals as a formidable team of two. Able to cast a wide variety of nature spells and take on the abilities and attributes of beasts, hunters magically improve both themselves and their animal companions.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Hunters can adapt their tactics to many kinds of opponents, and cherish their highly trained animal companions. As a team, the hunter and her companion can react to danger with incredible speed, making them excellent scouts, explorers, and saboteurs.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any neutral.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Druid and ranger.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Hunter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A hunter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A hunter casts divine spells drawn from the druid and ranger spell lists. Only druid spells of 6th level and lower and ranger spells are considered to be part of the hunter spell list. If a spell appears on both the druid and ranger spell lists, the hunter uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. For instance, reduce animal is a 2nd-level druid spell and a 3rd-level ranger spell, making it a 2nd-level hunter spell. Likewise, detect poison is a 0-level druid spell and a 2nd-level ranger spell, making it a 0-level hunter spell.</p>
			<p>The hunter can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a hunter must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a hunter&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the hunter&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>A hunter cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful Use Magic Device check) of druid spells of 7th level or higher. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells below.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a hunter can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-6: Hunter. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike druids and rangers, a hunter&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. A hunter begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new hunter level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a hunter knows is not affected by her Wisdom score; the numbers on Table 1-7 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by hunters as they gain levels, each hunter also automatically adds all summon nature&#146;s ally spells to her list of spells known. These spells are added as soon as the hunter is capable of casting them.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and at every 3 levels thereafter, a hunter can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the hunter loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A hunter may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any summon nature&#146;s ally spells.</p>
			<p>Unlike a druid or ranger, a hunter need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Hunters learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells: </b>A hunter can&#146;t cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity&#146;s (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Animal Focus (Su): </b>As a forester has no animal companion, the aspects granted by this ability always apply to the forester herself, just as if a normal hunter&#146;s companion were dead.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a hunter can take on the aspect of an animal as a swift action. She must select one type of animal to emulate, gaining a bonus or special ability based on the type of animal emulated and her hunter level. The hunter can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. The hunter can emulate only one animal at a time.</p>
			<p>The hunter can also apply one of these aspects to her animal companion. Unlike with the hunter herself, there is no duration on the animal aspect applied to her animal companion. An aspect applied in this way does not count against the hunter&#146;s minutes of duration per day-it remains in effect until the hunter changes it. The companion&#146;s aspect can be the same aspect the ranger has taken on or a different one. The hunter can select or change the animal foci on both herself and her animal companion as part of the same swift action.</p>
			<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, the hunter can apply her companion&#146;s animal focus to herself instead of her animal companion. This is in addition to the normal one she can choose, and (as with a companion&#146;s focus) remains in effect until the hunter changes it instead of counting against her minutes per day.</p>
			<p>See the Hunter Animal Focuses section for a full list of Focuses from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>A forester gains the ranger&#146;s favored terrain ability. She gains her first favored terrain at 5th level and a new favored terrain every 4 levels thereafter. In addition, at each such interval, the bonuses on initiative checks and skill checks in one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired) increase by 2. Starting at 5th level, a forester adds half her favored terrain bonus on damage rolls while in her favored terrain and fighting a creature native to that terrain.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Training (Ex): </b>A hunter counts her total hunter level as both druid levels and ranger levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats, traits, and options that modify or improve an animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A hunter can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Chapter 4 of the Core Rulebook). The hunter rolls 1d20 and adds her hunter level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the hunter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, inf luencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The hunter can also use this ability to inf luence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a forester gains one bonus combat feat. She must meet the prerequisites for this feat as normal. She gains an additional bonus combat feat at 7th, 13th, and 19th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hunter adds 1/2 her level to Survival skill checks made to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Tactician (Ex): </b>At 3rd level as a standard action, a forester can grant the benefits of one teamwork feat to all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear her. Allies retain the use of this bonus feat for 3 rounds plus 1 round for every 2 levels the forester has. Allies do not need to meet the prerequisites of these bonus feats. The forester can use this ability once per day at 3rd level, plus one additional time per day at 7th level and every 5 levels thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Teamwork Feat: </b>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, the hunter gains a bonus teamwork feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. The hunter must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus teamwork feat.</p>
			<p>As a standard action, the hunter can choose to learn a new bonus teamwork feat in place of the most recent bonus teamwork feat she has already learned. In effect, the hunter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. She can change only the most recent teamwork feat gained, and must meet the prerequisites for the newly selected feat. A hunter can change her most recent teamwork feat a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Whenever she gains a new teamwork feat, her previous teamwork feats become permanent.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a forester can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the forester is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless forester does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a hunter and her animal companion may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at their normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion will still affect the hunter and her animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Camouflage (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a forester can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of her favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn&#146;t grant cover or concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Second Animal Focus (Su): </b>At 8th level, whenever a hunter uses her animal focus ability, she selects two different animal aspects for herself instead of one, and can assign two aspects to her companion instead of one. As with the companion&#146;s previous aspect, the second one does not count against the minutes per day a hunter can take on an aspect.</p>
			<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead and the hunter has applied the companion&#146;s animal aspect to herself, that aspect does not count toward her maximum of two aspects at once. The hunter can still apply only one of her dead companion&#146;s aspects to herself, not both.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a hunter can move at her normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. She takes only a -10 penalty (instead of the normal -20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Breath of Life (Sp): </b>At 10th level, a forester can cast breath of life once per day as a spell-like ability.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a forester&#146;s evasion improves. Improved evasion works like evasion, except while the forester still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, she takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless forester does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>
			<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): </b>At 14th level, while in any of her favored terrains, a forester can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.</p>
			<p><b>One with the Wild (Ex): </b>At 17th level, the hunter and her animal companion are respected or even feared by other animals, so long as the animals are approximately of the same type as any of the hunter&#146;s current animal foci: bat for bats, tiger with felines, falcon for birds, snake for reptiles, and so on. No animal in this category (including dire varieties) willingly attacks the hunter or her companion unless magically compelled to or if the hunter or companion attacks it first.</p>
			<p>The hunter and her companion can attempt to demoralize animals in the appropriate category as a swift action, rolling 1d20 and adding the hunter&#146;s level and her Charisma modifier to determine the Intimidate check result.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a hunter becomes a master hunter, able to track down foes with ease. She can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty.</p>
			<p>Additionally, each day when the hunter regains her spell slots, she chooses one animal focus to be active on herself for the entire day. This focus is in addition to using her animal focus class ability (including the additional focus ability she is able to use on herself if her animal companion is dead).</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a hunter forms a bond with an animal companion. A hunter may begin play with any of the animals available to a druid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the hunter on her adventures. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the nature bond class feature). The hunter&#146;s effective druid level is equal to her hunter level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the companion&#146;s statistics and abilities. A hunter may teach her companion hunter&#146;s tricks from the skirmisher ranger archetype (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&#146;s Guide 128) instead of standard tricks. The animal companion can use skirmisher tricks when commanded, a number of times per day equal to half its Hit Dice plus its Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>If a hunter releases her companion from service or her animal companion perishes, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. While the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, any animal she summons with a summon nature&#146;s ally spell remains for 1 minute per level instead of 1 round per level. A hunter cannot have more than one summon nature&#146;s ally spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon nature&#146;s ally immediately ends.</p>

The hunter can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. The hunter can emulate only one animal at a time.</p>
					<p>The hunter can also apply one of these aspects to her animal companion. Unlike with the hunter herself, there is no duration on the animal aspect applied to her animal companion. An aspect applied in this way does not count against the hunter&#146;s minutes of duration per day-it remains in effect until the hunter changes it. The companion&#146;s aspect can be the same aspect the ranger has taken on or a different one. The hunter can select or change the animal foci on both herself and her animal companion as part of the same swift action.</p>
					<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, the hunter can apply her companion&#146;s animal focus to herself instead of her animal companion. This is in addition to the normal one she can choose, and (as with a companion&#146;s focus) remains in effect until the hunter changes it instead of counting against her minutes per day.</p>
					<p>See the Hunter Animal Focuses section for a full list of Focuses from all sources.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A hunter can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Chapter 4 of the Core Rulebook). The hunter rolls 1d20 and adds her hunter level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
					<p>To use wild empathy, the hunter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, inf luencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
					<p>The hunter can also use this ability to inf luence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A hunter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A hunter casts divine spells drawn from the druid and ranger spell lists. Only druid spells of 6th level and lower and ranger spells are considered to be part of the hunter spell list. If a spell appears on both the druid and ranger spell lists, the hunter uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. For instance, reduce animal is a 2nd-level druid spell and a 3rd-level ranger spell, making it a 2nd-level hunter spell. Likewise, detect poison is a 0-level druid spell and a 2nd-level ranger spell, making it a 0-level hunter spell.</p>
			<p>The hunter can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a hunter must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a hunter&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the hunter&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>A hunter cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful Use Magic Device check) of druid spells of 7th level or higher. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells below.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a hunter can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-6: Hunter. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike druids and rangers, a hunter&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. A hunter begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new hunter level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a hunter knows is not affected by her Wisdom score; the numbers on Table 1-7 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by hunters as they gain levels, each hunter also automatically adds all summon nature&#146;s ally spells to her list of spells known. These spells are added as soon as the hunter is capable of casting them.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and at every 3 levels thereafter, a hunter can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the hunter loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A hunter may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any summon nature&#146;s ally spells.</p>
			<p>Unlike a druid or ranger, a hunter need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Hunters learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells: </b>A hunter can&#146;t cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity&#146;s (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Animal Companion (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a hunter forms a bond with an animal companion. A hunter may begin play with any of the animals available to a druid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the hunter on her adventures. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the nature bond class feature). The hunter&#146;s effective druid level is equal to her hunter level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the companion&#146;s statistics and abilities. A hunter may teach her companion hunter&#146;s tricks from the skirmisher ranger archetype (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&#146;s Guide 128) instead of standard tricks. The animal companion can use skirmisher tricks when commanded, a number of times per day equal to half its Hit Dice plus its Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>If a hunter releases her companion from service or her animal companion perishes, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. While the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, any animal she summons with a summon nature&#146;s ally spell remains for 1 minute per level instead of 1 round per level. A hunter cannot have more than one summon nature&#146;s ally spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon nature&#146;s ally immediately ends.</p>
			<p><b>Animal Focus (Su): </b>At 1st level, a hunter can take on the aspect of an animal as a swift action. She must select one type of animal to emulate, gaining a bonus or special ability based on the type of animal emulated and her hunter level. The hunter can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. The hunter can emulate only one animal at a time.</p>
			<p>The hunter can also apply one of these aspects to her animal companion. Unlike with the hunter herself, there is no duration on the animal aspect applied to her animal companion. An aspect applied in this way does not count against the hunter&#146;s minutes of duration per day-it remains in effect until the hunter changes it. The companion&#146;s aspect can be the same aspect the ranger has taken on or a different one. The hunter can select or change the animal foci on both herself and her animal companion as part of the same swift action.</p>
			<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, the hunter can apply her companion&#146;s animal focus to herself instead of her animal companion. This is in addition to the normal one she can choose, and (as with a companion&#146;s focus) remains in effect until the hunter changes it instead of counting against her minutes per day.</p>
			<p>See the Hunter Animal Focuses section for a full list of Focuses from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Training (Ex): </b>A hunter counts her total hunter level as both druid levels and ranger levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats, traits, and options that modify or improve an animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A hunter can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Chapter 4 of the Core Rulebook). The hunter rolls 1d20 and adds her hunter level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the hunter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, inf luencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The hunter can also use this ability to inf luence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Precise Companion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hunter chooses either Precise Shot or OutflankAPG as a bonus feat. She does not need to meet the prerequisites for this feat. If she chooses Outflank, she automatically grants this feat to her animal companion as well.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hunter adds 1/2 her level to Survival skill checks made to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Twin Hunters (Ex): </b>Each time a flood flourisher gains a benefit from this archetype, she also grants the benefit to her animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Skilled Ambusher (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a flood flourisher gains either Athletic or Stealthy as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Empathic Link (Su): </b>At 4th level, the hunter gains an empathic link with her animal companion. This functions like an empathic link with a familiar, except the hunter can also see through a companion&#146;s eyes as a swift action, maintaining this connection as long as she likes (as long as the companion is within 1 mile) and ending it as a free action. The hunter is blinded while maintaining this connection.</p>
			<p><b>Watery Stride (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a flood flourisher and her animal companion gain a swim speed equal to their base land speed (maximum 30 feet). A flood flourisher or animal companion that already has a swim speed instead gains a +10 bonus on Acrobatics checks to avoid provoking attacks of opportunity from swimming out of a threatened square.</p>
			<p><b>Water Striker (Ex): </b>At 6th level, a flood flourisher gains the benefits of either Shot on the Run or Spring Attack, even if she does not meet either of the feats&#146; prerequisites. She gains the benefits of this feat only while using her swim speed.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Tricks (Ex): </b>At 7th level and every 6 levels thereafter, a hunter&#146;s animal companion learns a bonus trick (in addition to the bonus tricks gained from the hunter&#146;s effective druid level).</p>
			<p><b>Second Animal Focus (Su): </b>At 8th level, whenever a hunter uses her animal focus ability, she selects two different animal aspects for herself instead of one, and can assign two aspects to her companion instead of one. As with the companion&#146;s previous aspect, the second one does not count against the minutes per day a hunter can take on an aspect.</p>
			<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead and the hunter has applied the companion&#146;s animal aspect to herself, that aspect does not count toward her maximum of two aspects at once. The hunter can still apply only one of her dead companion&#146;s aspects to herself, not both.</p>
			<p><b>Submerged Stealth (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a flood flourisher learns how to ambush targets from beneath the muck, becoming a silent threat. While in a deep bog, the flood flourisher can use cover from the water to attempt Stealth checks with no penalties from the natural environment. While in a deep bog, as long as she moves no more than 5 feet in a round, she has tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet against anything that moves within the same body of water. While underwater in a deep bog, she can hold her breath for a number of minutes equal to 6 times her Constitution score before she risks drowning.</p>
			<p><b>Aquatic Action (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a flood flourisher gains the benefits of the aquatic action vigilante talent.</p>
			<p><b>Raise Animal Companion (Sp): </b>At 10th level, a hunter gains raise animal companionUM as a spell-like ability; this is not restricted to raising only her own animal companion. Using this spell-like ability gives the hunter a permanent negative level. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration), but automatically ends after 24 hours. At 16th level, this functions as resurrection instead of raise dead, but otherwise operates as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Speak with Master (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a hunter and her animal companion can communicate verbally, as if they were using a common language. Other creatures cannot understand the communication without magical aid.</p>
			<p><b>Sudden Strike (Ex): </b>At 12th level, a flood flourisher can better take advantage of the element of surprise. She can take a full round&#146;s worth of actions during the surprise round, rather than a single standard action or move action.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Empathic Link (Su): </b>At 14th level, the range of the hunter&#146;s empathic link with her animal companion increases to 10 miles. If the animal companion is within 1 mile, the hunter can communicate with it telepathically.</p>
			<p><b>Fast Submerged Stealth (Ex): </b>At 15th level, a flood flourisher can move up to her full swim speed with no penalty while using Stealth in a deep bog, and she can maintain her tremorsense from her submerged stealth while doing so.</p>
			<p><b>One with the Wild (Ex): </b>At 17th level, the hunter and her animal companion are respected or even feared by other animals, so long as the animals are approximately of the same type as any of the hunter&#146;s current animal foci: bat for bats, tiger with felines, falcon for birds, snake for reptiles, and so on. No animal in this category (including dire varieties) willingly attacks the hunter or her companion unless magically compelled to or if the hunter or companion attacks it first.</p>
			<p>The hunter and her companion can attempt to demoralize animals in the appropriate category as a swift action, rolling 1d20 and adding the hunter&#146;s level and her Charisma modifier to determine the Intimidate check result.</p>
			<p><b>Fast Swimmer (Ex): </b>At 18th level, a flood flourisher increases her swim speed by 20 feet.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a hunter becomes a master hunter, able to track down foes with ease. She can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty.</p>
			<p>Additionally, each day when the hunter regains her spell slots, she chooses one animal focus to be active on herself for the entire day. This focus is in addition to using her animal focus class ability (including the additional focus ability she is able to use on herself if her animal companion is dead).</p>

					<p>A hunter casts divine spells drawn from the druid and ranger spell lists. Only druid spells of 6th level and lower and ranger spells are considered to be part of the hunter spell list. If a spell appears on both the druid and ranger spell lists, the hunter uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. For instance, reduce animal is a 2nd-level druid spell and a 3rd-level ranger spell, making it a 2nd-level hunter spell. Likewise, detect poison is a 0-level druid spell and a 2nd-level ranger spell, making it a 0-level hunter spell.</p>
					<p>The hunter can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a hunter must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a hunter&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the hunter&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>A hunter cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful Use Magic Device check) of druid spells of 7th level or higher. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells below.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a hunter can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-6: Hunter. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>Unlike druids and rangers, a hunter&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. A hunter begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new hunter level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a hunter knows is not affected by her Wisdom score; the numbers on Table 1-7 are fixed.</p>
					<p>In addition to the spells gained by hunters as they gain levels, each hunter also automatically adds all summon nature&#146;s ally spells to her list of spells known. These spells are added as soon as the hunter is capable of casting them.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and at every 3 levels thereafter, a hunter can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the hunter loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A hunter may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any summon nature&#146;s ally spells.</p>
					<p>Unlike a druid or ranger, a hunter need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.</p>

				<name type="string">Animal Companion</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a hunter forms a bond with an animal companion. A hunter may begin play with any of the animals available to a druid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the hunter on her adventures. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the nature bond class feature). The hunter&#146;s effective druid level is equal to her hunter level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the companion&#146;s statistics and abilities. A hunter may teach her companion hunter&#146;s tricks from the skirmisher ranger archetype (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&#146;s Guide 128) instead of standard tricks. The animal companion can use skirmisher tricks when commanded, a number of times per day equal to half its Hit Dice plus its Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>If a hunter releases her companion from service or her animal companion perishes, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. While the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, any animal she summons with a summon nature&#146;s ally spell remains for 1 minute per level instead of 1 round per level. A hunter cannot have more than one summon nature&#146;s ally spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon nature&#146;s ally immediately ends.</p>

					<p>Goat: The creature gains a +2 competence bonus on saving throws against enchantment spells and spell-like abilities. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level.</p>
					<p>Mongoose: The creature gains a +2 competence bonus on grapple combat maneuver checks and on saving throws against poison. These bonuses increase to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level.</p>
					<p>Shark: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Survival checks to track a creature that has taken damage from the hunter or her animal companion in the past 24 hours. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p>
					<p>Turtle: The creature gains a +2 enhancement bonus to its natural armor bonus. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level. (A creature without natural armor has an effective natural armor bonus of +0.)</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A hunter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A hunter casts divine spells drawn from the druid and ranger spell lists. Only druid spells of 6th level and lower and ranger spells are considered to be part of the hunter spell list. If a spell appears on both the druid and ranger spell lists, the hunter uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. For instance, reduce animal is a 2nd-level druid spell and a 3rd-level ranger spell, making it a 2nd-level hunter spell. Likewise, detect poison is a 0-level druid spell and a 2nd-level ranger spell, making it a 0-level hunter spell.</p>
			<p>The hunter can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a hunter must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a hunter&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the hunter&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>A hunter cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful Use Magic Device check) of druid spells of 7th level or higher. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells below.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a hunter can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-6: Hunter. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike druids and rangers, a hunter&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. A hunter begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new hunter level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a hunter knows is not affected by her Wisdom score; the numbers on Table 1-7 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by hunters as they gain levels, each hunter also automatically adds all summon nature&#146;s ally spells to her list of spells known. These spells are added as soon as the hunter is capable of casting them.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and at every 3 levels thereafter, a hunter can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the hunter loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A hunter may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any summon nature&#146;s ally spells.</p>
			<p>Unlike a druid or ranger, a hunter need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Hunters learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells: </b>A hunter can&#146;t cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity&#146;s (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Animal Companion (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a hunter forms a bond with an animal companion. A hunter may begin play with any of the animals available to a druid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the hunter on her adventures. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the nature bond class feature). The hunter&#146;s effective druid level is equal to her hunter level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the companion&#146;s statistics and abilities. A hunter may teach her companion hunter&#146;s tricks from the skirmisher ranger archetype (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&#146;s Guide 128) instead of standard tricks. The animal companion can use skirmisher tricks when commanded, a number of times per day equal to half its Hit Dice plus its Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>If a hunter releases her companion from service or her animal companion perishes, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. While the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, any animal she summons with a summon nature&#146;s ally spell remains for 1 minute per level instead of 1 round per level. A hunter cannot have more than one summon nature&#146;s ally spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon nature&#146;s ally immediately ends.</p>
			<p><b>Animal Focus (Su): </b>At 1st level, a hunter can take on the aspect of an animal as a swift action. She must select one type of animal to emulate, gaining a bonus or special ability based on the type of animal emulated and her hunter level. The hunter can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. The hunter can emulate only one animal at a time.</p>
			<p>The hunter can also apply one of these aspects to her animal companion. Unlike with the hunter herself, there is no duration on the animal aspect applied to her animal companion. An aspect applied in this way does not count against the hunter&#146;s minutes of duration per day-it remains in effect until the hunter changes it. The companion&#146;s aspect can be the same aspect the ranger has taken on or a different one. The hunter can select or change the animal foci on both herself and her animal companion as part of the same swift action.</p>
			<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, the hunter can apply her companion&#146;s animal focus to herself instead of her animal companion. This is in addition to the normal one she can choose, and (as with a companion&#146;s focus) remains in effect until the hunter changes it instead of counting against her minutes per day.</p>
			<p>See the Hunter Animal Focuses section for a full list of Focuses from all sources.</p>
			<p>A feykiller emulates animals that grant her the ability to unmask fey trickery. She adds the following choices to her animal focus ability instead of the bear, frog, monkey, mouse, and snake choices.</p>
			<p>Crow: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Knowledge checks to identify the abilities and weaknesses of creatures. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Goat: The creature gains a +2 competence bonus on saving throws against enchantment spells and spell-like abilities. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Mongoose: The creature gains a +2 competence bonus on grapple combat maneuver checks and on saving throws against poison. These bonuses increase to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Shark: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Survival checks to track a creature that has taken damage from the hunter or her animal companion in the past 24 hours. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Turtle: The creature gains a +2 enhancement bonus to its natural armor bonus. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level. (A creature without natural armor has an effective natural armor bonus of +0.)</p>
			<p><b>Iron Talons (Ex): </b>Through training and prayer, a feykiller imbues her animal companion with an enhanced ability to fight fey. One of the animal companion&#146;s natural attacks, as selected by the feykiller, is treated as cold iron for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 7th level, all of her animal companion&#146;s natural attacks are treated as cold iron.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Training (Ex): </b>A hunter counts her total hunter level as both druid levels and ranger levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats, traits, and options that modify or improve an animal companion.</p>
			<p>The hunter can also use this ability to inf luence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Precise Companion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hunter chooses either Precise Shot or OutflankAPG as a bonus feat. She does not need to meet the prerequisites for this feat. If she chooses Outflank, she automatically grants this feat to her animal companion as well.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hunter adds 1/2 her level to Survival skill checks made to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Hunter Tactics (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, the hunter automatically grants her teamwork feats to her animal companion. The companion doesn&#146;t need to meet the prerequisites of these teamwork feats.</p>
			<p><b>Teamwork Feat: </b>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, the hunter gains a bonus teamwork feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. The hunter must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus teamwork feat.</p>
			<p>As a standard action, the hunter can choose to learn a new bonus teamwork feat in place of the most recent bonus teamwork feat she has already learned. In effect, the hunter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. She can change only the most recent teamwork feat gained, and must meet the prerequisites for the newly selected feat. A hunter can change her most recent teamwork feat a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Whenever she gains a new teamwork feat, her previous teamwork feats become permanent.</p>
			<p><b>Resist Nature&#146;s Lure (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a feykiller gains the resist nature&#146;s lure druid class feature whenever her animal companion is within 60 feet.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a hunter and her animal companion may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at their normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion will still affect the hunter and her animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Tricks (Ex): </b>At 7th level and every 6 levels thereafter, a hunter&#146;s animal companion learns a bonus trick (in addition to the bonus tricks gained from the hunter&#146;s effective druid level).</p>
			<p><b>Second Animal Focus (Su): </b>At 8th level, whenever a hunter uses her animal focus ability, she selects two different animal aspects for herself instead of one, and can assign two aspects to her companion instead of one. As with the companion&#146;s previous aspect, the second one does not count against the minutes per day a hunter can take on an aspect.</p>
			<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead and the hunter has applied the companion&#146;s animal aspect to herself, that aspect does not count toward her maximum of two aspects at once. The hunter can still apply only one of her dead companion&#146;s aspects to herself, not both.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a hunter can move at her normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. She takes only a -10 penalty (instead of the normal -20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Raise Animal Companion (Sp): </b>At 10th level, a hunter gains raise animal companionUM as a spell-like ability; this is not restricted to raising only her own animal companion. Using this spell-like ability gives the hunter a permanent negative level. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration), but automatically ends after 24 hours. At 16th level, this functions as resurrection instead of raise dead, but otherwise operates as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Empathic Link (Su): </b>At 14th level, the range of the hunter&#146;s empathic link with her animal companion increases to 10 miles. If the animal companion is within 1 mile, the hunter can communicate with it telepathically.</p>
			<p><b>Grounded (Su): </b>At 17th level, a feykiller gains a +4 insight bonus on saving throws against illusion and enchantment effects, and she is immune to illusion and enchantment effects created by fey. This ability functions only when her animal companion is within 60 feet.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a hunter becomes a master hunter, able to track down foes with ease. She can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty.</p>
			<p>Additionally, each day when the hunter regains her spell slots, she chooses one animal focus to be active on herself for the entire day. This focus is in addition to using her animal focus class ability (including the additional focus ability she is able to use on herself if her animal companion is dead).</p>

This functions as the animal focus class feature, except that the hunter always applies the animal aspect to herself, and there is no limit to this ability&#146;s duration. She can end this ability as a free action.</p>
					<p>When a feral hunter uses this ability, her body takes on cosmetic aspects of an animal, such as furry skin, longer nails, elongated teeth, and oddly colored eyes; these changes do not grant her any abilities other than what is stated in the animal focus, and end when she takes on a different aspect or ends the ability. This physical change is a polymorph effect, though the effects of the animal focus are not.</p>
					<p>This ability alters animal focus and replaces the hunter tactics and speak with master class abilities.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A hunter can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Chapter 4 of the Core Rulebook). The hunter rolls 1d20 and adds her hunter level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
					<p>To use wild empathy, the hunter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, inf luencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
					<p>The hunter can also use this ability to inf luence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A feral hunter has forged a bond with nature that&#146;s so strong that she doesn&#146;t merely channel the aspects of animals&#151; she actually becomes an animal herself. Though she lacks an animal companion, a feral hunter is in tune with the beast lurking within her flesh and spirit, and lives in a near-wild state of being. A feral hunter often resembles a lycanthrope, but her power comes from her own nature and is not inf luenced by moonlight or silver.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Hunters are warriors of the wilds that have forged close bonds with trusted animal companions. They focus their tactics on fighting alongside their companion animals as a formidable team of two. Able to cast a wide variety of nature spells and take on the abilities and attributes of beasts, hunters magically improve both themselves and their animal companions.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Hunters can adapt their tactics to many kinds of opponents, and cherish their highly trained animal companions. As a team, the hunter and her companion can react to danger with incredible speed, making them excellent scouts, explorers, and saboteurs.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any neutral.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Druid and ranger.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Hunter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p>Skill Points at each Level: 6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A hunter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A hunter casts divine spells drawn from the druid and ranger spell lists. Only druid spells of 6th level and lower and ranger spells are considered to be part of the hunter spell list. If a spell appears on both the druid and ranger spell lists, the hunter uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. For instance, reduce animal is a 2nd-level druid spell and a 3rd-level ranger spell, making it a 2nd-level hunter spell. Likewise, detect poison is a 0-level druid spell and a 2nd-level ranger spell, making it a 0-level hunter spell.</p>
			<p>The hunter can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a hunter must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a hunter&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the hunter&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>A hunter cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful Use Magic Device check) of druid spells of 7th level or higher. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells below.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a hunter can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-6: Hunter. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike druids and rangers, a hunter&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. A hunter begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new hunter level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a hunter knows is not affected by her Wisdom score; the numbers on Table 1-7 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by hunters as they gain levels, each hunter also automatically adds all summon nature&#146;s ally spells to her list of spells known. These spells are added as soon as the hunter is capable of casting them.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and at every 3 levels thereafter, a hunter can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the hunter loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A hunter may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any summon nature&#146;s ally spells.</p>
			<p>Unlike a druid or ranger, a hunter need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Hunters learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells: </b>A hunter can&#146;t cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity&#146;s (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Feral Focus (Su): </b>At 1st level, a feral hunter gains a limited ability to change her shape into hybrid animal forms. This functions as the animal focus class feature, except that the hunter always applies the animal aspect to herself, and there is no limit to this ability&#146;s duration. She can end this ability as a free action.</p>
			<p>When a feral hunter uses this ability, her body takes on cosmetic aspects of an animal, such as furry skin, longer nails, elongated teeth, and oddly colored eyes; these changes do not grant her any abilities other than what is stated in the animal focus, and end when she takes on a different aspect or ends the ability. This physical change is a polymorph effect, though the effects of the animal focus are not.</p>
			<p>This ability alters animal focus and replaces the hunter tactics and speak with master class abilities.</p>
			<p><b>Solitary: </b>Unlike most hunters, a feral hunter does not gain an animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Training (Ex): </b>A hunter counts her total hunter level as both druid levels and ranger levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats, traits, and options that modify or improve an animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A hunter can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Chapter 4 of the Core Rulebook). The hunter rolls 1d20 and adds her hunter level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the hunter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, inf luencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The hunter can also use this ability to inf luence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Precise Summoned Animal (Ex): </b>This functions like the precise companion class ability, except the hunter grants all her teamwork feats to all animals she summons with summon nature&#146;s ally. This ability alters precise companion.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hunter adds 1/2 her level to Survival skill checks made to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Hunter Tactics (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, the hunter automatically grants her teamwork feats to her animal companion. The companion doesn&#146;t need to meet the prerequisites of these teamwork feats.</p>
			<p><b>Teamwork Feat: </b>At 3rd level, the hunter gains a bonus teamwork feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. The hunter must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus teamwork feat.</p>
			<p>As a standard action, the hunter can choose to learn a new bonus teamwork feat in place of the most recent bonus teamwork feat she has already learned. In effect, the hunter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. She can change only the most recent teamwork feat gained, and must meet the prerequisites for the newly selected feat. A hunter can change her most recent teamwork feat a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Whenever she gains a new teamwork feat, her previous teamwork feats become permanent.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su): </b>At 4th level, a feral hunter gains the ability to change shape. This ability functions like the druid wild shape ability, except the hunter can take only animal forms (not elemental or plant forms). The hunter&#146;s effective druid level is equal to her class level. This ability replaces the bonus tricks, improved empathic link, greater empathic link, master of the wild, and raise animal companion class abilities.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a hunter and her animal companion may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at their normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion will still affect the hunter and her animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Summon Pack (Sp): </b>Starting at 6th level, whenever a feral hunter casts a summon nature&#146;s ally spell to summon one or more animals, she summons one additional animal of the same type. The summoned creature or creatures must be animals and must be of the same type as the hunter&#146;s current aspect or of a similar type (bears for bear aspect, dogs or wolves for wolf aspect, great cats for the tiger aspect, and so on). The additional creature immediately vanishes if the hunter chooses a different aspect or ends his feral focus ability. She can increase the duration of any one summon nature's ally spell affected by this ability to 1 minute per level. She can have only one spell with a duration increased by this ability active at a time. This ability replaces the teamwork feats gained at 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Second Feral Focus (Su): </b>At 8th level, whenever a hunter uses her animal focus ability, she selects two different animal aspects for herself instead of one, and can assign two aspects to her companion instead of one. As with the companion&#146;s previous aspect, the second one does not count against the minutes per day a hunter can take on an aspect.</p>
			<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead and the hunter has applied the companion&#146;s animal aspect to herself, that aspect does not count toward her maximum of two aspects at once. The hunter can still apply only one of her dead companion&#146;s aspects to herself, not both.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a hunter can move at her normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. She takes only a -10 penalty (instead of the normal -20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a hunter becomes a master hunter, able to track down foes with ease. She can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty.</p>
			<p>Additionally, each day when the hunter regains her spell slots, she chooses one animal focus to be active on herself for the entire day. This focus is in addition to using her animal focus class ability (including the additional focus ability she is able to use on herself if her animal companion is dead).</p>

					<p>A hunter casts divine spells drawn from the druid and ranger spell lists. Only druid spells of 6th level and lower and ranger spells are considered to be part of the hunter spell list. If a spell appears on both the druid and ranger spell lists, the hunter uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. For instance, reduce animal is a 2nd-level druid spell and a 3rd-level ranger spell, making it a 2nd-level hunter spell. Likewise, detect poison is a 0-level druid spell and a 2nd-level ranger spell, making it a 0-level hunter spell.</p>
					<p>The hunter can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a hunter must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a hunter&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the hunter&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>A hunter cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful Use Magic Device check) of druid spells of 7th level or higher. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells below.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a hunter can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-6: Hunter. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>Unlike druids and rangers, a hunter&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. A hunter begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new hunter level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a hunter knows is not affected by her Wisdom score; the numbers on Table 1-7 are fixed.</p>
					<p>In addition to the spells gained by hunters as they gain levels, each hunter also automatically adds all summon nature&#146;s ally spells to her list of spells known. These spells are added as soon as the hunter is capable of casting them.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and at every 3 levels thereafter, a hunter can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the hunter loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A hunter may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any summon nature&#146;s ally spells.</p>
					<p>Unlike a druid or ranger, a hunter need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.</p>

				<name type="string">Animal Companion</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a hunter forms a bond with an animal companion. A hunter may begin play with any of the animals available to a druid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the hunter on her adventures. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the nature bond class feature). The hunter&#146;s effective druid level is equal to her hunter level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the companion&#146;s statistics and abilities. A hunter may teach her companion hunter&#146;s tricks from the skirmisher ranger archetype (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&#146;s Guide 128) instead of standard tricks. The animal companion can use skirmisher tricks when commanded, a number of times per day equal to half its Hit Dice plus its Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>If a hunter releases her companion from service or her animal companion perishes, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. While the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, any animal she summons with a summon nature&#146;s ally spell remains for 1 minute per level instead of 1 round per level. A hunter cannot have more than one summon nature&#146;s ally spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon nature&#146;s ally immediately ends.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a hunter can take on the aspect of an animal as a swift action. She must select one type of animal to emulate, gaining a bonus or special ability based on the type of animal emulated and her hunter level. The hunter can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. The hunter can emulate only one animal at a time.</p>
					<p>The hunter can also apply one of these aspects to her animal companion. Unlike with the hunter herself, there is no duration on the animal aspect applied to her animal companion. An aspect applied in this way does not count against the hunter&#146;s minutes of duration per day-it remains in effect until the hunter changes it. The companion&#146;s aspect can be the same aspect the ranger has taken on or a different one. The hunter can select or change the animal foci on both herself and her animal companion as part of the same swift action.</p>
					<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, the hunter can apply her companion&#146;s animal focus to herself instead of her animal companion. This is in addition to the normal one she can choose, and (as with a companion&#146;s focus) remains in effect until the hunter changes it instead of counting against her minutes per day.</p>

If the hunter is neutral and worships a neutral deity, she must choose either the celestial or fiendish template; once this choice is made, it cannot be changed.

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A hunter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A hunter casts divine spells drawn from the druid and ranger spell lists. Only druid spells of 6th level and lower and ranger spells are considered to be part of the hunter spell list. If a spell appears on both the druid and ranger spell lists, the hunter uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. For instance, reduce animal is a 2nd-level druid spell and a 3rd-level ranger spell, making it a 2nd-level hunter spell. Likewise, detect poison is a 0-level druid spell and a 2nd-level ranger spell, making it a 0-level hunter spell.</p>
			<p>The hunter can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a hunter must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a hunter&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the hunter&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>A hunter cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful Use Magic Device check) of druid spells of 7th level or higher. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells below.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a hunter can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-6: Hunter. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike druids and rangers, a hunter&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. A hunter begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new hunter level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a hunter knows is not affected by her Wisdom score; the numbers on Table 1-7 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by hunters as they gain levels, each hunter also automatically adds all summon nature&#146;s ally spells to her list of spells known. These spells are added as soon as the hunter is capable of casting them.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and at every 3 levels thereafter, a hunter can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the hunter loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A hunter may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any summon nature&#146;s ally spells.</p>
			<p>Unlike a druid or ranger, a hunter need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Hunters learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells: </b>A hunter can&#146;t cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity&#146;s (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Animal Companion (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a hunter forms a bond with an animal companion. A hunter may begin play with any of the animals available to a druid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the hunter on her adventures. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the nature bond class feature). The hunter&#146;s effective druid level is equal to her hunter level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the companion&#146;s statistics and abilities. A hunter may teach her companion hunter&#146;s tricks from the skirmisher ranger archetype (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&#146;s Guide 128) instead of standard tricks. The animal companion can use skirmisher tricks when commanded, a number of times per day equal to half its Hit Dice plus its Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>If a hunter releases her companion from service or her animal companion perishes, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. While the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, any animal she summons with a summon nature&#146;s ally spell remains for 1 minute per level instead of 1 round per level. A hunter cannot have more than one summon nature&#146;s ally spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon nature&#146;s ally immediately ends.</p>
			<p><b>Animal Focus (Su): </b>At 1st level, a hunter can take on the aspect of an animal as a swift action. She must select one type of animal to emulate, gaining a bonus or special ability based on the type of animal emulated and her hunter level. The hunter can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. The hunter can emulate only one animal at a time.</p>
			<p>The hunter can also apply one of these aspects to her animal companion. Unlike with the hunter herself, there is no duration on the animal aspect applied to her animal companion. An aspect applied in this way does not count against the hunter&#146;s minutes of duration per day-it remains in effect until the hunter changes it. The companion&#146;s aspect can be the same aspect the ranger has taken on or a different one. The hunter can select or change the animal foci on both herself and her animal companion as part of the same swift action.</p>
			<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, the hunter can apply her companion&#146;s animal focus to herself instead of her animal companion. This is in addition to the normal one she can choose, and (as with a companion&#146;s focus) remains in effect until the hunter changes it instead of counting against her minutes per day.</p>
			<p>See the Hunter Animal Focuses section for a full list of Focuses from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Training (Ex): </b>A hunter counts her total hunter level as both druid levels and ranger levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats, traits, and options that modify or improve an animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A hunter can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Chapter 4 of the Core Rulebook). The hunter rolls 1d20 and adds her hunter level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the hunter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, inf luencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The hunter can also use this ability to inf luence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Precise Companion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hunter chooses either Precise Shot or OutflankAPG as a bonus feat. She does not need to meet the prerequisites for this feat. If she chooses Outflank, she automatically grants this feat to her animal companion as well.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hunter adds 1/2 her level to Survival skill checks made to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Domain: </b>At 3rd level, a divine hunter learns to call upon the power of her deity. The divine hunter must select one domain from those available to her deity. She gains the granted powers of this domain, using her hunter level &#150; 2 as her cleric level for determining when the powers are gained and what effects they have. Once she chooses this domain, it cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>If the divine hunter selects the animal domain, she does not gain a second animal companion upon reaching an effective cleric level of 4th. When the divine hunter would gain that ability, her animal companion instead gains two ability score increases (gaining +1 to two different ability scores or +2 to one ability score). If her animal companion dies or is released, when she gains a new one, it benefits from this ability score increase.</p>
			<p>In addition, the divine hunter adds the 1st-level domain spell from her domain to her list of spells known. She adds the 2nd-level domain spell at 6th level, the 3rd-level domain spell at 9th level, the 4th-level domain spell at 12th level, the 5th-level domain spell at 15th level, and the 6th-level domain spell at 18th level.</p>
			<p><b>Otherworldly Companion (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a hunter&#146;s companion takes on otherworldly features. If the divine hunter is good (or worships a good deity), the animal companion gains the celestial template. If the hunter is evil (or worships an evil deity), the animal companion gains the fiendish template. If the hunter is neutral and worships a neutral deity, she must choose either the celestial or fiendish template; once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. The companion's CR is considered to be equal to its Hit Dice for the purpose of the celestial or fiendish template. This ability replaces hunter tactics.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Empathic Link (Su): </b>At 4th level, the hunter gains an empathic link with her animal companion. This functions like an empathic link with a familiar, except the hunter can also see through a companion&#146;s eyes as a swift action, maintaining this connection as long as she likes (as long as the companion is within 1 mile) and ending it as a free action. The hunter is blinded while maintaining this connection.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a hunter and her animal companion may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at their normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion will still affect the hunter and her animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Tricks (Ex): </b>At 7th level and every 6 levels thereafter, a hunter&#146;s animal companion learns a bonus trick (in addition to the bonus tricks gained from the hunter&#146;s effective druid level).</p>
			<p><b>Second Animal Focus (Su): </b>At 8th level, whenever a hunter uses her animal focus ability, she selects two different animal aspects for herself instead of one, and can assign two aspects to her companion instead of one. As with the companion&#146;s previous aspect, the second one does not count against the minutes per day a hunter can take on an aspect.</p>
			<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead and the hunter has applied the companion&#146;s animal aspect to herself, that aspect does not count toward her maximum of two aspects at once. The hunter can still apply only one of her dead companion&#146;s aspects to herself, not both.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a hunter can move at her normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. She takes only a -10 penalty (instead of the normal -20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Raise Animal Companion (Sp): </b>At 10th level, a hunter gains raise animal companionUM as a spell-like ability; this is not restricted to raising only her own animal companion. Using this spell-like ability gives the hunter a permanent negative level. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration), but automatically ends after 24 hours. At 16th level, this functions as resurrection instead of raise dead, but otherwise operates as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Speak with Master (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a hunter and her animal companion can communicate verbally, as if they were using a common language. Other creatures cannot understand the communication without magical aid.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Empathic Link (Su): </b>At 14th level, the range of the hunter&#146;s empathic link with her animal companion increases to 10 miles. If the animal companion is within 1 mile, the hunter can communicate with it telepathically.</p>
			<p><b>One with the Wild (Ex): </b>At 17th level, the hunter and her animal companion are respected or even feared by other animals, so long as the animals are approximately of the same type as any of the hunter&#146;s current animal foci: bat for bats, tiger with felines, falcon for birds, snake for reptiles, and so on. No animal in this category (including dire varieties) willingly attacks the hunter or her companion unless magically compelled to or if the hunter or companion attacks it first.</p>
			<p>The hunter and her companion can attempt to demoralize animals in the appropriate category as a swift action, rolling 1d20 and adding the hunter&#146;s level and her Charisma modifier to determine the Intimidate check result.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a hunter becomes a master hunter, able to track down foes with ease. She can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty.</p>
			<p>Additionally, each day when the hunter regains her spell slots, she chooses one animal focus to be active on herself for the entire day. This focus is in addition to using her animal focus class ability (including the additional focus ability she is able to use on herself if her animal companion is dead).</p>

As a standard action, the courtly hunter can touch her animal companion to transform it.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>While most hunters find themselves at ease in the wildest parts of the world, courtly hunters instead make their homes in cultured urban environments. They and their animal companions are more refined than typical hunters, using their skills to navigate the winding paths of courtly intrigue as surely as other hunters find trails in the wilderness.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Hunters are warriors of the wilds that have forged close bonds with trusted animal companions. They focus their tactics on fighting alongside their companion animals as a formidable team of two. Able to cast a wide variety of nature spells and take on the abilities and attributes of beasts, hunters magically improve both themselves and their animal companions.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Hunters can adapt their tactics to many kinds of opponents, and cherish their highly trained animal companions. As a team, the hunter and her companion can react to danger with incredible speed, making them excellent scouts, explorers, and saboteurs.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any neutral.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Druid and ranger.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Hunter's class skills are Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p>Skill Points at each Level: 6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A hunter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A hunter casts divine spells drawn from the druid and ranger spell lists. Only druid spells of 6th level and lower and ranger spells are considered to be part of the hunter spell list. If a spell appears on both the druid and ranger spell lists, the hunter uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. For instance, reduce animal is a 2nd-level druid spell and a 3rd-level ranger spell, making it a 2nd-level hunter spell. Likewise, detect poison is a 0-level druid spell and a 2nd-level ranger spell, making it a 0-level hunter spell.</p>
			<p>The hunter can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a hunter must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a hunter&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the hunter&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>A hunter cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful Use Magic Device check) of druid spells of 7th level or higher. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells below.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a hunter can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-6: Hunter. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike druids and rangers, a hunter&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. A hunter begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new hunter level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a hunter knows is not affected by her Wisdom score; the numbers on Table 1-7 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by hunters as they gain levels, each hunter also automatically adds all summon nature&#146;s ally spells to her list of spells known. These spells are added as soon as the hunter is capable of casting them.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and at every 3 levels thereafter, a hunter can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the hunter loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A hunter may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any summon nature&#146;s ally spells.</p>
			<p>Unlike a druid or ranger, a hunter need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Hunters learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells: </b>A hunter can&#146;t cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity&#146;s (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Courtly Companion: </b>A courtly hunter&#146;s animal companion was touched by either the fey or the nature spirits that form leshys and answer to commune with nature, granting it its own intelligence. The companion&#146;s type changes to magical beast (augmented animal), but this doesn&#146;t change any of its statistics and it counts as an animal, not as a magical beast, for the purposes of determining all effects, prerequisites, and so on. It does not learn tricks, but it does have an Intelligence score equal to that of a familiar belonging to a wizard of the courtly hunter&#146;s hunter level. Levels in other classes that grant animal companions do not stack with levels of courtly hunter for the purpose of determining the abilities of her courtly companion.</p>
			<p><b>Refined Focus (Su): </b>A courtly hunter has access to a different set of animal aspects with her animal focus. She does not gain access to the bear, bull, frog, monkey, snake, stag, tiger, or wolf aspects. Instead, she gains access to the following aspects.</p>
			<p>Beaver: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Craft checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Chameleon: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Disguise checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Eagle: The creature gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Charisma. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Fox: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Bluff checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Frilled Lizard: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Intimidate checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Octopus: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Escape Artist checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Raccoon: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Sleight of Hand checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Songbird: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Perform checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Training (Ex): </b>A hunter counts her total hunter level as both druid levels and ranger levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats, traits, and options that modify or improve an animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A hunter can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Chapter 4 of the Core Rulebook). The hunter rolls 1d20 and adds her hunter level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the hunter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, inf luencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The hunter can also use this ability to inf luence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Subtle Companion (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a courtly hunter can transform her animal companion into a similar Tiny animal to allow it hide easily or even blend in and act as a spy. For instance, a tiger could be transformed into a housecat, a wolf could be transformed into a Tiny dog, a dire bat could be transformed into a Tiny flying fox, and so on. This functions as a polymorph effect, and the animal companion gains a +2 size bonus to Dexterity and a &#150;4 size penalty to Strength (use the polymorph table on page 212 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook to adjust its ability score if the animal companion is larger than Medium). As a standard action, the courtly hunter can touch her animal companion to transform it.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hunter adds 1/2 her level to Survival skill checks made to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Skill Bond (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a courtly hunter&#146;s animal companion gains the courtly hunter&#146;s class skills as class skills. Her animal companion can use the courtly hunter&#146;s skill ranks in a skill in place of its own, but only to a maximum of the courtly hunter&#146;s hunter level (for instance, if a character had 3 levels in courtly hunter and 5 ranks in Diplomacy, her animal companion could either share 3 ranks with skill bond or use its own ranks, whichever would result in a higher total skill bonus).</p>
			<p><b>Improved Empathic Link (Su): </b>At 4th level, the hunter gains an empathic link with her animal companion. This functions like an empathic link with a familiar, except the hunter can also see through a companion&#146;s eyes as a swift action, maintaining this connection as long as she likes (as long as the companion is within 1 mile) and ending it as a free action. The hunter is blinded while maintaining this connection.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a hunter and her animal companion may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at their normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion will still affect the hunter and her animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Alternate Form (Su): </b>At 7th level, the courtly hunter&#146;s animal companion learns an additional subtle form. When the courtly hunter gains this ability, she chooses a Tiny animal. When under the effects of the subtle companion ability, the courtly hunter&#146;s animal companion can change between a shrunken, more innocuous version of its original shape or the shape of the chosen animal as a standard action. When it transforms, it loses abilities dependent on its original shape and gains abilities from its new shape as beast shape II. At 13th and 19th levels, the courtly hunter can select an additional form to add to the animal companion&#146;s list of choices while it is in its polymorphed form.</p>
			<p><b>Second Refined Focus (Su): </b>At 8th level, whenever a hunter uses her animal focus ability, she selects two different animal aspects for herself instead of one, and can assign two aspects to her companion instead of one. As with the companion&#146;s previous aspect, the second one does not count against the minutes per day a hunter can take on an aspect.</p>
			<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead and the hunter has applied the companion&#146;s animal aspect to herself, that aspect does not count toward her maximum of two aspects at once. The hunter can still apply only one of her dead companion&#146;s aspects to herself, not both.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a hunter can move at her normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. She takes only a -10 penalty (instead of the normal -20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Raise Animal Companion (Sp): </b>At 10th level, a hunter gains raise animal companionUM as a spell-like ability; this is not restricted to raising only her own animal companion. Using this spell-like ability gives the hunter a permanent negative level. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration), but automatically ends after 24 hours. At 16th level, this functions as resurrection instead of raise dead, but otherwise operates as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Speak with Master (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a hunter and her animal companion can communicate verbally, as if they were using a common language. Other creatures cannot understand the communication without magical aid.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Empathic Link (Su): </b>At 14th level, the range of the hunter&#146;s empathic link with her animal companion increases to 10 miles. If the animal companion is within 1 mile, the hunter can communicate with it telepathically.</p>
			<p><b>One with the Wild (Ex): </b>At 17th level, the hunter and her animal companion are respected or even feared by other animals, so long as the animals are approximately of the same type as any of the hunter&#146;s current animal foci: bat for bats, tiger with felines, falcon for birds, snake for reptiles, and so on. No animal in this category (including dire varieties) willingly attacks the hunter or her companion unless magically compelled to or if the hunter or companion attacks it first.</p>
			<p>The hunter and her companion can attempt to demoralize animals in the appropriate category as a swift action, rolling 1d20 and adding the hunter&#146;s level and her Charisma modifier to determine the Intimidate check result.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a hunter becomes a master hunter, able to track down foes with ease. She can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty.</p>
			<p>Additionally, each day when the hunter regains her spell slots, she chooses one animal focus to be active on herself for the entire day. This focus is in addition to using her animal focus class ability (including the additional focus ability she is able to use on herself if her animal companion is dead).</p>

					<p>A hunter casts divine spells drawn from the druid and ranger spell lists. Only druid spells of 6th level and lower and ranger spells are considered to be part of the hunter spell list. If a spell appears on both the druid and ranger spell lists, the hunter uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. For instance, reduce animal is a 2nd-level druid spell and a 3rd-level ranger spell, making it a 2nd-level hunter spell. Likewise, detect poison is a 0-level druid spell and a 2nd-level ranger spell, making it a 0-level hunter spell.</p>
					<p>The hunter can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a hunter must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a hunter&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the hunter&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>A hunter cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful Use Magic Device check) of druid spells of 7th level or higher. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells below.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a hunter can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-6: Hunter. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>Unlike druids and rangers, a hunter&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. A hunter begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new hunter level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a hunter knows is not affected by her Wisdom score; the numbers on Table 1-7 are fixed.</p>
					<p>In addition to the spells gained by hunters as they gain levels, each hunter also automatically adds all summon nature&#146;s ally spells to her list of spells known. These spells are added as soon as the hunter is capable of casting them.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and at every 3 levels thereafter, a hunter can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the hunter loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A hunter may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any summon nature&#146;s ally spells.</p>
					<p>Unlike a druid or ranger, a hunter need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.</p>

				<name type="string">Animal Companion</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a hunter forms a bond with an animal companion. A hunter may begin play with any of the animals available to a druid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the hunter on her adventures. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the nature bond class feature). The hunter&#146;s effective druid level is equal to her hunter level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the companion&#146;s statistics and abilities. A hunter may teach her companion hunter&#146;s tricks from the skirmisher ranger archetype (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&#146;s Guide 128) instead of standard tricks. The animal companion can use skirmisher tricks when commanded, a number of times per day equal to half its Hit Dice plus its Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>If a hunter releases her companion from service or her animal companion perishes, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. While the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, any animal she summons with a summon nature&#146;s ally spell remains for 1 minute per level instead of 1 round per level. A hunter cannot have more than one summon nature&#146;s ally spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon nature&#146;s ally immediately ends.</p>

				<name type="string">Scapegoat</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A colluding scoundrel is adept at redirecting a foe&#146;s hostility toward another creature, creating openings for her own attacks. A number of times per day equal to her hunter level, as a swift action, she can target one foe within 30 feet and designate one willing ally adjacent to that foe as a scapegoat. For the following minute, the target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attacks against any creature other than the designated scapegoat, and the target has a 10% spell failure chance on spells that don&#146;t target the scapegoat or include the scapegoat in their area of effect. The penalty increases to &#150;4 at 8th level and &#150;6 at 15th level.</p>
					<p>The colluding scoundrel can designate her animal companion as a scapegoat without it counting against her daily uses of this ability.</p>
					<p>This is a mind-affecting effect. The effect ends if the colluding scoundrel falls unconscious or is slain.</p>

				<name type="string">Wild Empathy</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A hunter can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Chapter 4 of the Core Rulebook). The hunter rolls 1d20 and adds her hunter level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
					<p>To use wild empathy, the hunter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, inf luencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
					<p>The hunter can also use this ability to inf luence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The colluding scoundrel is a canny and conniving skirmisher, manipulating her enemies and leveraging her allies for her own benefit. A Free Captain ordering her crew to occupy foes and thus expose the enemy to her attacks might take this archetype, and colluding scoundrels have proven to be formidable members of the Wasp Queens, as their giant wasp companions draw out opponents to fall under the Wasp Queens&#146; stinging blades. In any case, the colluding scoundrel rarely concerns herself overmuch with her allies&#146; well-being.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A hunter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A hunter casts divine spells drawn from the druid and ranger spell lists. Only druid spells of 6th level and lower and ranger spells are considered to be part of the hunter spell list. If a spell appears on both the druid and ranger spell lists, the hunter uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. For instance, reduce animal is a 2nd-level druid spell and a 3rd-level ranger spell, making it a 2nd-level hunter spell. Likewise, detect poison is a 0-level druid spell and a 2nd-level ranger spell, making it a 0-level hunter spell.</p>
			<p>The hunter can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a hunter must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a hunter&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the hunter&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>A hunter cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful Use Magic Device check) of druid spells of 7th level or higher. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells below.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a hunter can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-6: Hunter. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike druids and rangers, a hunter&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. A hunter begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new hunter level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a hunter knows is not affected by her Wisdom score; the numbers on Table 1-7 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by hunters as they gain levels, each hunter also automatically adds all summon nature&#146;s ally spells to her list of spells known. These spells are added as soon as the hunter is capable of casting them.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and at every 3 levels thereafter, a hunter can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the hunter loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A hunter may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any summon nature&#146;s ally spells.</p>
			<p>Unlike a druid or ranger, a hunter need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Hunters learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells: </b>A hunter can&#146;t cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity&#146;s (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Animal Companion (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a hunter forms a bond with an animal companion. A hunter may begin play with any of the animals available to a druid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the hunter on her adventures. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the nature bond class feature). The hunter&#146;s effective druid level is equal to her hunter level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the companion&#146;s statistics and abilities. A hunter may teach her companion hunter&#146;s tricks from the skirmisher ranger archetype (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&#146;s Guide 128) instead of standard tricks. The animal companion can use skirmisher tricks when commanded, a number of times per day equal to half its Hit Dice plus its Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>If a hunter releases her companion from service or her animal companion perishes, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. While the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, any animal she summons with a summon nature&#146;s ally spell remains for 1 minute per level instead of 1 round per level. A hunter cannot have more than one summon nature&#146;s ally spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon nature&#146;s ally immediately ends.</p>
			<p><b>Scapegoat (Ex): </b>A colluding scoundrel is adept at redirecting a foe&#146;s hostility toward another creature, creating openings for her own attacks. A number of times per day equal to her hunter level, as a swift action, she can target one foe within 30 feet and designate one willing ally adjacent to that foe as a scapegoat. For the following minute, the target takes a &#150;2 penalty on attacks against any creature other than the designated scapegoat, and the target has a 10% spell failure chance on spells that don&#146;t target the scapegoat or include the scapegoat in their area of effect. The penalty increases to &#150;4 at 8th level and &#150;6 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>The colluding scoundrel can designate her animal companion as a scapegoat without it counting against her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p>This is a mind-affecting effect. The effect ends if the colluding scoundrel falls unconscious or is slain.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Training (Ex): </b>A hunter counts her total hunter level as both druid levels and ranger levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats, traits, and options that modify or improve an animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A hunter can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Chapter 4 of the Core Rulebook). The hunter rolls 1d20 and adds her hunter level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the hunter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, inf luencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The hunter can also use this ability to inf luence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Precise Companion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hunter chooses either Precise Shot or OutflankAPG as a bonus feat. She does not need to meet the prerequisites for this feat. If she chooses Outflank, she automatically grants this feat to her animal companion as well.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hunter adds 1/2 her level to Survival skill checks made to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Hunter Tactics (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, the hunter automatically grants her teamwork feats to her animal companion. The companion doesn&#146;t need to meet the prerequisites of these teamwork feats.</p>
			<p><b>Teamwork Feat: </b>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, the hunter gains a bonus teamwork feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. The hunter must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus teamwork feat.</p>
			<p>As a standard action, the hunter can choose to learn a new bonus teamwork feat in place of the most recent bonus teamwork feat she has already learned. In effect, the hunter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. She can change only the most recent teamwork feat gained, and must meet the prerequisites for the newly selected feat. A hunter can change her most recent teamwork feat a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Whenever she gains a new teamwork feat, her previous teamwork feats become permanent.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Empathic Link (Su): </b>At 4th level, the hunter gains an empathic link with her animal companion. This functions like an empathic link with a familiar, except the hunter can also see through a companion&#146;s eyes as a swift action, maintaining this connection as long as she likes (as long as the companion is within 1 mile) and ending it as a free action. The hunter is blinded while maintaining this connection.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a hunter and her animal companion may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at their normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion will still affect the hunter and her animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Tricks (Ex): </b>At 7th level and every 6 levels thereafter, a hunter&#146;s animal companion learns a bonus trick (in addition to the bonus tricks gained from the hunter&#146;s effective druid level).</p>
			<p><b>Backstabber (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a colluding scoundrel deals 2d6 additional points of damage on attacks against a target threatened by an ally currently designated as the scapegoat. This increases to 3d6 points of damage at 15th level. This is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit, but it does stack with sneak attack and similar effects.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a hunter can move at her normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. She takes only a -10 penalty (instead of the normal -20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Raise Animal Companion (Sp): </b>At 10th level, a hunter gains raise animal companionUM as a spell-like ability; this is not restricted to raising only her own animal companion. Using this spell-like ability gives the hunter a permanent negative level. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration), but automatically ends after 24 hours. At 16th level, this functions as resurrection instead of raise dead, but otherwise operates as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Speak with Master (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a hunter and her animal companion can communicate verbally, as if they were using a common language. Other creatures cannot understand the communication without magical aid.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Empathic Link (Su): </b>At 14th level, the range of the hunter&#146;s empathic link with her animal companion increases to 10 miles. If the animal companion is within 1 mile, the hunter can communicate with it telepathically.</p>
			<p><b>One with the Wild (Ex): </b>At 17th level, the hunter and her animal companion are respected or even feared by other animals, so long as the animals are approximately of the same type as any of the hunter&#146;s current animal foci: bat for bats, tiger with felines, falcon for birds, snake for reptiles, and so on. No animal in this category (including dire varieties) willingly attacks the hunter or her companion unless magically compelled to or if the hunter or companion attacks it first.</p>
			<p>The hunter and her companion can attempt to demoralize animals in the appropriate category as a swift action, rolling 1d20 and adding the hunter&#146;s level and her Charisma modifier to determine the Intimidate check result.</p>
			<p><b>Master Backstabber (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a colluding scoundrel is a master at dispatching distracted targets. As a standard action, she can make a single attack against a foe that is taking the penalties of her scapegoat ability and is adjacent to an ally currently designated as the scapegoat. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half the colluding scoundrel&#146;s level + her Wisdom modifier) or be slain. Whether or not the target succeeds, it cannot be targeted by this ability again (by any colluding scoundrel) for 24 hours.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a hunter can take on the aspect of an animal as a swift action. She must select one type of animal to emulate, gaining a bonus or special ability based on the type of animal emulated and her hunter level. The hunter can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. The hunter can emulate only one animal at a time.</p>
					<p>The hunter can also apply one of these aspects to her animal companion. Unlike with the hunter herself, there is no duration on the animal aspect applied to her animal companion. An aspect applied in this way does not count against the hunter&#146;s minutes of duration per day-it remains in effect until the hunter changes it. The companion&#146;s aspect can be the same aspect the ranger has taken on or a different one. The hunter can select or change the animal foci on both herself and her animal companion as part of the same swift action.</p>
					<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, the hunter can apply her companion&#146;s animal focus to herself instead of her animal companion. This is in addition to the normal one she can choose, and (as with a companion&#146;s focus) remains in effect until the hunter changes it instead of counting against her minutes per day.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A hunter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A hunter casts divine spells drawn from the druid and ranger spell lists. Only druid spells of 6th level and lower and ranger spells are considered to be part of the hunter spell list. If a spell appears on both the druid and ranger spell lists, the hunter uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. For instance, reduce animal is a 2nd-level druid spell and a 3rd-level ranger spell, making it a 2nd-level hunter spell. Likewise, detect poison is a 0-level druid spell and a 2nd-level ranger spell, making it a 0-level hunter spell.</p>
			<p>The hunter can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a hunter must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a hunter&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the hunter&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>A hunter cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful Use Magic Device check) of druid spells of 7th level or higher. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells below.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a hunter can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-6: Hunter. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike druids and rangers, a hunter&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. A hunter begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new hunter level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a hunter knows is not affected by her Wisdom score; the numbers on Table 1-7 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by hunters as they gain levels, each hunter also automatically adds all summon nature&#146;s ally spells to her list of spells known. These spells are added as soon as the hunter is capable of casting them.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and at every 3 levels thereafter, a hunter can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the hunter loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A hunter may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any summon nature&#146;s ally spells.</p>
			<p>Unlike a druid or ranger, a hunter need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Hunters learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells: </b>A hunter can&#146;t cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity&#146;s (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Animal Companion (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a hunter forms a bond with an animal companion. A hunter may begin play with any of the animals available to a druid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the hunter on her adventures. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the nature bond class feature). The hunter&#146;s effective druid level is equal to her hunter level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the companion&#146;s statistics and abilities. A hunter may teach her companion hunter&#146;s tricks from the skirmisher ranger archetype (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&#146;s Guide 128) instead of standard tricks. The animal companion can use skirmisher tricks when commanded, a number of times per day equal to half its Hit Dice plus its Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>If a hunter releases her companion from service or her animal companion perishes, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. While the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, any animal she summons with a summon nature&#146;s ally spell remains for 1 minute per level instead of 1 round per level. A hunter cannot have more than one summon nature&#146;s ally spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon nature&#146;s ally immediately ends.</p>
			<p><b>Animal Focus (Su): </b>At 1st level, a hunter can take on the aspect of an animal as a swift action. She must select one type of animal to emulate, gaining a bonus or special ability based on the type of animal emulated and her hunter level. The hunter can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. The hunter can emulate only one animal at a time.</p>
			<p>The hunter can also apply one of these aspects to her animal companion. Unlike with the hunter herself, there is no duration on the animal aspect applied to her animal companion. An aspect applied in this way does not count against the hunter&#146;s minutes of duration per day-it remains in effect until the hunter changes it. The companion&#146;s aspect can be the same aspect the ranger has taken on or a different one. The hunter can select or change the animal foci on both herself and her animal companion as part of the same swift action.</p>
			<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, the hunter can apply her companion&#146;s animal focus to herself instead of her animal companion. This is in addition to the normal one she can choose, and (as with a companion&#146;s focus) remains in effect until the hunter changes it instead of counting against her minutes per day.</p>
			<p>See the Hunter Animal Focuses section for a full list of Focuses from all sources.</p>
			<p><b>Nature Training (Ex): </b>A hunter counts her total hunter level as both druid levels and ranger levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats, traits, and options that modify or improve an animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Terrain Chameleon (Su): </b>Choose one type of terrain from the ranger&#146;s list of favored terrains. When in the specified type of terrain, a chameleon adept gains a bonus equal to half her hunter level on Stealth checks.</p>
			<p><b>Savage Diplomacy (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, while in humanoid form, a chameleon adept&#146;s animal companion grants its master a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks. Savage diplomacy functions only as long as the creature being influenced can see both the companion and the master. This bonus increases by 1 at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter, to a maximum of +6 at 17th level.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hunter adds 1/2 her level to Survival skill checks made to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Shifting Companion (Su): </b>At 3rd level as a standard action, a chameleon adept can cause her companion to assume a humanoid form of the same race as herself. This functions as alter self, except it is used on an adjacent animal companion to have it assume a humanoid form. The companion always assumes the same form, selected when the hunter reaches 3rd level. The hunter can change this form when she gains a new level, but the companion loses the old form and can&#146;t resume it unless the chameleon adept chooses that form when she reaches a new level. The companion is no more intelligent or less savage than normal; the hunter still needs to control it as normal, and it still can&#146;t activate magic items or wield manufactured weapons. The hunter can use this ability for 10 minutes per day per hunter level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 10-minute increments.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Empathic Link (Su): </b>At 4th level, the hunter gains an empathic link with her animal companion. This functions like an empathic link with a familiar, except the hunter can also see through a companion&#146;s eyes as a swift action, maintaining this connection as long as she likes (as long as the companion is within 1 mile) and ending it as a free action. The hunter is blinded while maintaining this connection.</p>
			<p><b>Animal Shape (Su): </b>At 5th level as a standard action, a chameleon adept can assume a form superficially identical to her animal companion&#146;s animal form. She gains no bonuses or natural attacks while in this form, only forms of movement. Her size category does not change. This is a polymorph effect. She can assume this form for 1 minute per level per day, in 1-minute increments. She can dismiss this ability at any point as a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Tricks (Ex): </b>At 7th level and every 6 levels thereafter, a hunter&#146;s animal companion learns a bonus trick (in addition to the bonus tricks gained from the hunter&#146;s effective druid level).</p>
			<p><b>Second Animal Focus (Su): </b>At 8th level, whenever a hunter uses her animal focus ability, she selects two different animal aspects for herself instead of one, and can assign two aspects to her companion instead of one. As with the companion&#146;s previous aspect, the second one does not count against the minutes per day a hunter can take on an aspect.</p>
			<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead and the hunter has applied the companion&#146;s animal aspect to herself, that aspect does not count toward her maximum of two aspects at once. The hunter can still apply only one of her dead companion&#146;s aspects to herself, not both.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a hunter can move at her normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. She takes only a -10 penalty (instead of the normal -20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Shifting Companion (Su): </b>At 10th level, a chameleon adept&#146;s animal companion improves its ability to change shape. It can use wild shape, as a druid of half the hunter&#146;s level, to gain the effects of beast shape I. Unlike a druid&#146;s wild shape, this ability does not improve to encompass larger or smaller animals or elementals.</p>
			<p><b>Speak with Master (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a hunter and her animal companion can communicate verbally, as if they were using a common language. Other creatures cannot understand the communication without magical aid.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Empathic Link (Su): </b>At 14th level, the range of the hunter&#146;s empathic link with her animal companion increases to 10 miles. If the animal companion is within 1 mile, the hunter can communicate with it telepathically.</p>
			<p><b>One with the Wild (Ex): </b>At 17th level, when the companion is using wild shape to appear as a different type of animal, it counts as being in that animal focus for the purpose of one with the wild.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a hunter becomes a master hunter, able to track down foes with ease. She can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty.</p>
			<p>Additionally, each day when the hunter regains her spell slots, she chooses one animal focus to be active on herself for the entire day. This focus is in addition to using her animal focus class ability (including the additional focus ability she is able to use on herself if her animal companion is dead).</p>

This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the hunter on her adventures. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the nature bond class feature). The hunter&#146;s effective druid level is equal to her hunter level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the companion&#146;s statistics and abilities. A hunter may teach her companion hunter&#146;s tricks from the skirmisher ranger archetype (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&#146;s Guide 128) instead of standard tricks. The animal companion can use skirmisher tricks when commanded, a number of times per day equal to half its Hit Dice plus its Wisdom modifier.</p>
					<p>If a hunter releases her companion from service or her animal companion perishes, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. While the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, any animal she summons with a summon nature&#146;s ally spell remains for 1 minute per level instead of 1 round per level. A hunter cannot have more than one summon nature&#146;s ally spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon nature&#146;s ally immediately ends.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>An aquatic beastmaster emulates animals found beneath the waves. This functions as animal focus, but it allows only the following choices.</p>
					<p>At 1st level, a hunter can take on the aspect of an animal as a swift action. She must select one type of animal to emulate, gaining a bonus or special ability based on the type of animal emulated and her hunter level. The hunter can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. The hunter can emulate only one animal at a time.</p>
					<p>The hunter can also apply one of these aspects to her animal companion. Unlike with the hunter herself, there is no duration on the animal aspect applied to her animal companion. An aspect applied in this way does not count against the hunter&#146;s minutes of duration per day-it remains in effect until the hunter changes it. The companion&#146;s aspect can be the same aspect the ranger has taken on or a different one. The hunter can select or change the animal foci on both herself and her animal companion as part of the same swift action.</p>
					<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, the hunter can apply her companion&#146;s animal focus to herself instead of her animal companion. This is in addition to the normal one she can choose, and (as with a companion&#146;s focus) remains in effect until the hunter changes it instead of counting against her minutes per day.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>An aquatic beastmaster&#146;s wild empathy functions only on creatures that have a swim speed or the aquatic or water subtype. However, she can improve the attitude of any such creature with Intelligence 2 or less regardless of type, including mindless creatures.</p>
					<p>A hunter can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Chapter 4 of the Core Rulebook). The hunter rolls 1d20 and adds her hunter level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
					<p>To use wild empathy, the hunter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, inf luencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
					<p>The hunter can also use this ability to inf luence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Hunters beneath the sea are just as committed as their surface-dwelling counterparts to working alongside their animal companions to eradicate threats. Although many aquatic beastmasters simply want to be left alone in the areas they have claimed as their own, others use their abilities to fight against aboleth masterminds, sahuagin tribes, and other villains that haunt the oceans.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Hunters are warriors of the wilds that have forged close bonds with trusted animal companions. They focus their tactics on fighting alongside their companion animals as a formidable team of two. Able to cast a wide variety of nature spells and take on the abilities and attributes of beasts, hunters magically improve both themselves and their animal companions.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Hunters can adapt their tactics to many kinds of opponents, and cherish their highly trained animal companions. As a team, the hunter and her companion can react to danger with incredible speed, making them excellent scouts, explorers, and saboteurs.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any neutral.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Druid and ranger.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>4d6 x 10 gp (average 140 gp).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A hunter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A hunter casts divine spells drawn from the druid and ranger spell lists. Only druid spells of 6th level and lower and ranger spells are considered to be part of the hunter spell list. If a spell appears on both the druid and ranger spell lists, the hunter uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. For instance, reduce animal is a 2nd-level druid spell and a 3rd-level ranger spell, making it a 2nd-level hunter spell. Likewise, detect poison is a 0-level druid spell and a 2nd-level ranger spell, making it a 0-level hunter spell.</p>
			<p>The hunter can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a hunter must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a hunter&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the hunter&#146;s Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>A hunter cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful Use Magic Device check) of druid spells of 7th level or higher. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells below.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a hunter can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-6: Hunter. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike druids and rangers, a hunter&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. A hunter begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new hunter level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a hunter knows is not affected by her Wisdom score; the numbers on Table 1-7 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by hunters as they gain levels, each hunter also automatically adds all summon nature&#146;s ally spells to her list of spells known. These spells are added as soon as the hunter is capable of casting them.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and at every 3 levels thereafter, a hunter can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the hunter loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A hunter may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any summon nature&#146;s ally spells.</p>
			<p>Unlike a druid or ranger, a hunter need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Hunters learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells: </b>A hunter can&#146;t cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity&#146;s (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>
			<p><b>Animal Companion (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a hunter forms a bond with an animal companion. A hunter may begin play with any of the animals available to a druid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the hunter on her adventures. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the nature bond class feature). The hunter&#146;s effective druid level is equal to her hunter level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the companion&#146;s statistics and abilities. A hunter may teach her companion hunter&#146;s tricks from the skirmisher ranger archetype (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&#146;s Guide 128) instead of standard tricks. The animal companion can use skirmisher tricks when commanded, a number of times per day equal to half its Hit Dice plus its Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>If a hunter releases her companion from service or her animal companion perishes, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. While the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, any animal she summons with a summon nature&#146;s ally spell remains for 1 minute per level instead of 1 round per level. A hunter cannot have more than one summon nature&#146;s ally spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon nature&#146;s ally immediately ends.</p>
			<p><b>Animal Focus (Su): </b>At 1st level, a hunter can take on the aspect of an animal as a swift action. She must select one type of animal to emulate, gaining a bonus or special ability based on the type of animal emulated and her hunter level. The hunter can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. The hunter can emulate only one animal at a time.</p>
			<p>The hunter can also apply one of these aspects to her animal companion. Unlike with the hunter herself, there is no duration on the animal aspect applied to her animal companion. An aspect applied in this way does not count against the hunter&#146;s minutes of duration per day-it remains in effect until the hunter changes it. The companion&#146;s aspect can be the same aspect the ranger has taken on or a different one. The hunter can select or change the animal foci on both herself and her animal companion as part of the same swift action.</p>
			<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead, the hunter can apply her companion&#146;s animal focus to herself instead of her animal companion. This is in addition to the normal one she can choose, and (as with a companion&#146;s focus) remains in effect until the hunter changes it instead of counting against her minutes per day.</p>
			<p>An aquatic beastmaster emulates animals found beneath the waves. This functions as animal focus, but it allows only the following choices.</p>
			<p>Crab: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Swim checks and a +2 competence bonus on grapple combat maneuver checks. These bonuses increase to +6 and +4, respectively, at 8th level and to +8 and +6 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Dolphin: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Knowledge checks to identify the abilities and weaknesses of creatures. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and to +8 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Eel: The creature gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and to +6 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Manta Ray: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Stealth checks and a +2 bonus on saving throws against poison. These bonuses increase to +6 and +4, respectively, at 8th level and to +8 and +6 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Octopus: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Swim checks and a +2 competence bonus on grapple combat maneuver checks. These bonuses increase to +6 and +4, respectively, at 8th level and to +8 and +6 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Orca: The creature gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and to +6 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Shark: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Survival checks to track a creature to which the hunter or her animal companion has dealt damage in the past 24 hours. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and to +8 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Snake: The creature gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls when making attacks of opportunity and a +2 dodge bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity. These bonuses increase to +4 at 8th level and to +6 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Turtle: The creature gains a +2 enhancement bonus to its natural armor bonus. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and to +6 at 15th level. (A creature without natural armor has an effective natural armor bonus of +0.)</p>
			<p><b>Nature Training (Ex): </b>A hunter counts her total hunter level as both druid levels and ranger levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats, traits, and options that modify or improve an animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>An aquatic beastmaster&#146;s wild empathy functions only on creatures that have a swim speed or the aquatic or water subtype. However, she can improve the attitude of any such creature with Intelligence 2 or less regardless of type, including mindless creatures.</p>
			<p>A hunter can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Chapter 4 of the Core Rulebook). The hunter rolls 1d20 and adds her hunter level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>To use wild empathy, the hunter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, inf luencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The hunter can also use this ability to inf luence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Precise Companion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hunter chooses either Precise Shot or OutflankAPG as a bonus feat. She does not need to meet the prerequisites for this feat. If she chooses Outflank, she automatically grants this feat to her animal companion as well.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hunter adds 1/2 her level to Survival skill checks made to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Hunter Tactics (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, the hunter automatically grants her teamwork feats to her animal companion. The companion doesn&#146;t need to meet the prerequisites of these teamwork feats.</p>
			<p><b>Teamwork Feat: </b>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, the hunter gains a bonus teamwork feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. The hunter must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus teamwork feat.</p>
			<p>As a standard action, the hunter can choose to learn a new bonus teamwork feat in place of the most recent bonus teamwork feat she has already learned. In effect, the hunter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. She can change only the most recent teamwork feat gained, and must meet the prerequisites for the newly selected feat. A hunter can change her most recent teamwork feat a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Whenever she gains a new teamwork feat, her previous teamwork feats become permanent.</p>
			<p><b>Oceanic Defense (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an aquatic beastmaster gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against spells with the water descriptor and the extraordinary or supernatural abilities of creatures with the aquatic or water subtype whenever her animal companion is within 60 feet.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a hunter and her animal companion may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at their normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>
			<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion will still affect the hunter and her animal companion.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Tricks (Ex): </b>At 7th level and every 6 levels thereafter, a hunter&#146;s animal companion learns a bonus trick (in addition to the bonus tricks gained from the hunter&#146;s effective druid level).</p>
			<p><b>Second Animal Focus (Su): </b>At 8th level, whenever a hunter uses her animal focus ability, she selects two different animal aspects for herself instead of one, and can assign two aspects to her companion instead of one. As with the companion&#146;s previous aspect, the second one does not count against the minutes per day a hunter can take on an aspect.</p>
			<p>If the hunter&#146;s animal companion is dead and the hunter has applied the companion&#146;s animal aspect to herself, that aspect does not count toward her maximum of two aspects at once. The hunter can still apply only one of her dead companion&#146;s aspects to herself, not both.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a hunter can move at her normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. She takes only a -10 penalty (instead of the normal -20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
			<p><b>Raise Animal Companion (Sp): </b>At 10th level, a hunter gains raise animal companionUM as a spell-like ability; this is not restricted to raising only her own animal companion. Using this spell-like ability gives the hunter a permanent negative level. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration), but automatically ends after 24 hours. At 16th level, this functions as resurrection instead of raise dead, but otherwise operates as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Speak with Master (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a hunter and her animal companion can communicate verbally, as if they were using a common language. Other creatures cannot understand the communication without magical aid.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Empathic Link (Su): </b>At 14th level, the range of the hunter&#146;s empathic link with her animal companion increases to 10 miles. If the animal companion is within 1 mile, the hunter can communicate with it telepathically.</p>
			<p><b>One with the Wild (Ex): </b>At 17th level, the hunter and her animal companion are respected or even feared by other animals, so long as the animals are approximately of the same type as any of the hunter&#146;s current animal foci: bat for bats, tiger with felines, falcon for birds, snake for reptiles, and so on. No animal in this category (including dire varieties) willingly attacks the hunter or her companion unless magically compelled to or if the hunter or companion attacks it first.</p>
			<p>The hunter and her companion can attempt to demoralize animals in the appropriate category as a swift action, rolling 1d20 and adding the hunter&#146;s level and her Charisma modifier to determine the Intimidate check result.</p>
			<p><b>Master Hunter (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a hunter becomes a master hunter, able to track down foes with ease. She can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty.</p>
			<p>Additionally, each day when the hunter regains her spell slots, she chooses one animal focus to be active on herself for the entire day. This focus is in addition to using her animal focus class ability (including the additional focus ability she is able to use on herself if her animal companion is dead).</p>
