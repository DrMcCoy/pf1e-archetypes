					<p>A brawler is proficient with all simple weapons plus the handaxe, short sword, and weapons from the close fighter weapon group. She is proficient with light armor and shields (except tower shields).</p>

				<name type="string">Improved Awesome Blow</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 20th level, the brawler can use her awesome blow ability as an attack rather than as a standard action. She may use it on creatures of any size. If the maneuver roll is a natural 20, the brawler can immediately attempt to confirm the critical by rolling another combat maneuver check with all the same modifiers as the one just rolled; if the confirmation roll is successful, the attack deals double damage, and the damage from hitting an obstacle (if any) is also doubled.</p>

				<name type="string">Awesome Blow</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 16th level, the brawler can as a standard action perform an awesome blow combat maneuver against a corporeal creature of her size or smaller. If the combat maneuver check succeeds, the opponent takes damage as if the brawler hit it with the close weapon she is wielding or an unarmed strike, it is knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of the brawler&#146;s choice, and it falls prone. The brawler can only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent can&#146;t move closer to the brawler than the square it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent&#146;s move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle. (Unlike the Awesome Blow monster feat, the brawler can be of any size to use this ability.)</p>

				<name type="string">Close Weapon Mastery</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 5th level, a brawler&#146;s damage with close weapons increases. When wielding a close weapon, she uses the unarmed strike damage of a brawler 4 levels lower instead of the base damage for that weapon (for example, a 5th-level Medium brawler wielding a punching dagger deals 1d6 points of damage instead of the weapon&#146;s normal 1d4). If the weapon normally deals more damage than this, its damage is unchanged. This ability does not affect any other aspect of the weapon. The brawler can decide to use the weapon&#146;s base damage instead of her adjusted unarmed strike damage&#151;this must be declared before the attack roll is made.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 5th level, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 9th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 12th level, she chooses one alignment component: chaotic, evil, good, or lawful; her unarmed strikes also count as this alignment for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. (This alignment component cannot be the opposite of the brawler&#146;s actual alignment, such as a good brawler choosing evil strikes.) At 17th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>

				<name type="string">Knockout (1/day)</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, once per day a brawler can unleash a devastating attack that can instantly knock a target unconscious. She must announce this intent before making her attack roll. If the brawler hits and the target takes damage from the blow, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the brawler&#146;s level + the higher of the brawler&#146;s Strength or Dexterity modifier) or fall unconscious for 1d6 rounds. Each round on its turn, the unconscious target may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect as a fullround action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Creatures immune to critical hits or nonlethal damage are immune to this ability. At 10th level, the brawler may use this ability twice per day; at 16th level, she may use it three times per day.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, when a brawler wears light or no armor, she gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC and CMD. This bonus increases by 1 at 9th, 13th, and 18th levels.</p>
					<p>These bonuses to AC apply against touch attacks. She loses these bonuses while immobilized or helpless, wearing medium or heavy armor, or carrying a medium or heavy load.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 3rd level, a brawler can select one combat maneuver to receive additional training. She gains a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks when performing that combat maneuver and a +1 bonus to her CMD when defending against that maneuver.</p>
					<p>At 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the brawler becomes further trained in another combat maneuver, gaining the above +1 bonus combat maneuver checks and to CMD. In addition, the bonuses granted by all previous maneuver training increase by 1 each. (For example, if a brawler chooses grapple at 3rd level and sunder at 7th level, her bonuses to grapple are +2 and bonuses to sunder are +1. If she then chooses bull rush upon reaching 11th level, her bonuses to grapple are +3, to sunder are +2, and to bull rush are +1.)</p>

				<name type="string">Brawler&#146;s Flurry</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Starting at 2nd level, a brawler can make a brawler&#146;s flurry as a full-attack action. When doing so, a brawler has the Two-Weapon Fighting feat when attacking with any combination of unarmed strikes, weapons from the close fighter weapon group, or weapons with the &#147;monk&#148; special feature. She does not need to use two different weapons to use this ability.</p>
					<p>A brawler applies her full Strength modifier to her damage rolls for all attacks made with brawler&#146;s flurry, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand weapon or a weapon wielded in both hands. A brawler can substitute disarm, sunder, and trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of brawler&#146;s flurry. A brawler with natural weapons can&#146;t use such weapons as part of brawler&#146;s flurry, nor can she make natural weapon attacks in addition to her brawler&#146;s flurry attacks.</p>
					<p>At 8th level, the brawler gains use of the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry. At 15th level, she gains use of the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry.</p>

				<name type="string">Bonus Combat Feat</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 2nd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler gains a bonus combat feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be ones that affect or improve her defenses or melee attacks. The brawler must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus combat feat.</p>
					<p>Upon reaching 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler can choose to learn a new bonus combat feat in place of a bonus combat feat she has already learned. In effect, the brawler loses the bonus combat feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A brawler can only change one feat at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time she gains a new bonus combat feat for the level.</p>

				<name type="string">Unarmed Strike</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a brawler gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A brawler may attack with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a brawler may make unarmed strikes with her hands full. A brawler applies her full Strength modifier (not half ) on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.</p>
					<p>Usually, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.</p>
					<p>A brawler&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that modify either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
					<p>A brawler also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than others, as shown on Table 1&#150;5: Brawler. The unarmed damage values listed on that table are for Medium brawlers. A Small brawler deals less damage than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large brawler deals more damage; see the following table.</p>

				<name type="string">Martial Training</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a brawler counts her total brawler levels as both fighter levels and monk levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats. She also counts as both a fighter and a monk for feats and magic items that have different effects based on whether the character has levels in those classes (such as Stunning Fist and a monk&#146;s robe). This ability does not automatically grant feats normally granted to fighters and monks based on class level, namely Stunning Fist.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A brawler can take a move action to gain the benefit of a combat feat she doesn&#146;t possess. This effect lasts for 1 minute. The brawler must meet all the feat&#146;s prerequisites. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 her brawler level (minimum 1).</p>
					<p>The brawler can use this ability again before the duration expires in order to replace the previous combat feat with another choice.</p>
					<p>If a combat feat has a daily use limitation (such as Stunning Fist), any uses of that combat feat while using this ability count toward that feat&#146;s daily limit. At 6th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of two combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a swift action or two feats as a move action. She may use one of these feats to meet a prerequisite of the second feat; doing so means that she cannot replace a feat currently fulfilling another&#146;s prerequisite without also replacing those feats that require it. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
					<p>At 10th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of three combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a free action, two feats as a swift action, or three feats as a move action. She may use one of the feats to meet a prerequisite of the second and third feats, and use the second feat to meet a prerequisite of the third feat. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
					<p>At 12th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of one combat feat as an immediate action or three combat feats as a swift action. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
					<p>At 20th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of any number of combat feats as a swift action. Each feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A brawler is proficient with all simple weapons plus the handaxe, short sword, and weapons from the close fighter weapon group. She is proficient with light armor and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Cunning (Ex): </b>If the brawler&#146;s Intelligence score is less than 13, it counts as 13 for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of combat feats.</p>
			<p><b>Martial Flexibility (Ex): </b>A brawler can take a move action to gain the benefit of a combat feat she doesn&#146;t possess. This effect lasts for 1 minute. The brawler must meet all the feat&#146;s prerequisites. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 her brawler level (minimum 1).</p>
			<p>The brawler can use this ability again before the duration expires in order to replace the previous combat feat with another choice.</p>
			<p>If a combat feat has a daily use limitation (such as Stunning Fist), any uses of that combat feat while using this ability count toward that feat&#146;s daily limit. At 6th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of two combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a swift action or two feats as a move action. She may use one of these feats to meet a prerequisite of the second feat; doing so means that she cannot replace a feat currently fulfilling another&#146;s prerequisite without also replacing those feats that require it. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of three combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a free action, two feats as a swift action, or three feats as a move action. She may use one of the feats to meet a prerequisite of the second and third feats, and use the second feat to meet a prerequisite of the third feat. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of one combat feat as an immediate action or three combat feats as a swift action. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p>At 20th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of any number of combat feats as a swift action. Each feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Martial Training (Ex) </b>At 1st level, a brawler counts her total brawler levels as both fighter levels and monk levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats. She also counts as both a fighter and a monk for feats and magic items that have different effects based on whether the character has levels in those classes (such as Stunning Fist and a monk&#146;s robe). This ability does not automatically grant feats normally granted to fighters and monks based on class level, namely Stunning Fist.</p>
			<p><b>Unarmed Strike: </b>At 1st level, a brawler gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A brawler may attack with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a brawler may make unarmed strikes with her hands full. A brawler applies her full Strength modifier (not half ) on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.</p>
			<p>Usually, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.</p>
			<p>A brawler&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that modify either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
			<p>A brawler also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than others, as shown on Table 1&#150;5: Brawler. The unarmed damage values listed on that table are for Medium brawlers. A Small brawler deals less damage than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large brawler deals more damage; see the following table.</p>

			<p><b>Bonus Combat Feats: </b>At 2nd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler gains a bonus combat feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be ones that affect or improve her defenses or melee attacks. The brawler must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus combat feat.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler can choose to learn a new bonus combat feat in place of a bonus combat feat she has already learned. In effect, the brawler loses the bonus combat feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A brawler can only change one feat at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time she gains a new bonus combat feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Flurry (Ex): </b>Starting at 2nd level, a brawler can make a brawler&#146;s flurry as a full-attack action. When doing so, a brawler has the Two-Weapon Fighting feat when attacking with any combination of unarmed strikes, weapons from the close fighter weapon group, or weapons with the &#147;monk&#148; special feature. She does not need to use two different weapons to use this ability.</p>
			<p>A brawler applies her full Strength modifier to her damage rolls for all attacks made with brawler&#146;s flurry, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand weapon or a weapon wielded in both hands. A brawler can substitute disarm, sunder, and trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of brawler&#146;s flurry. A brawler with natural weapons can&#146;t use such weapons as part of brawler&#146;s flurry, nor can she make natural weapon attacks in addition to her brawler&#146;s flurry attacks.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the brawler gains use of the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry. At 15th level, she gains use of the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry.</p>
			<p><b>Maneuver Training (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a brawler can select one combat maneuver to receive additional training. She gains a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks when performing that combat maneuver and a +1 bonus to her CMD when defending against that maneuver.</p>
			<p>At 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the brawler becomes further trained in another combat maneuver, gaining the above +1 bonus combat maneuver checks and to CMD. In addition, the bonuses granted by all previous maneuver training increase by 1 each. (For example, if a brawler chooses grapple at 3rd level and sunder at 7th level, her bonuses to grapple are +2 and bonuses to sunder are +1. If she then chooses bull rush upon reaching 11th level, her bonuses to grapple are +3, to sunder are +2, and to bull rush are +1.)</p>
			<p><b>AC Bonus (Ex): </b>At 4th level, when a brawler wears light or no armor, she gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC and CMD. This bonus increases by 1 at 9th, 13th, and 18th levels.</p>
			<p>These bonuses to AC apply against touch attacks. She loses these bonuses while immobilized or helpless, wearing medium or heavy armor, or carrying a medium or heavy load.</p>
			<p><b>Knockout (Ex): </b>At 4th level, once per day a brawler can unleash a devastating attack that can instantly knock a target unconscious. She must announce this intent before making her attack roll. If the brawler hits and the target takes damage from the blow, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the brawler&#146;s level + the higher of the brawler&#146;s Strength or Dexterity modifier) or fall unconscious for 1d6 rounds. Each round on its turn, the unconscious target may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect as a fullround action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Creatures immune to critical hits or nonlethal damage are immune to this ability. At 10th level, the brawler may use this ability twice per day; at 16th level, she may use it three times per day.</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Strike (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 9th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 12th level, she chooses one alignment component: chaotic, evil, good, or lawful; her unarmed strikes also count as this alignment for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. (This alignment component cannot be the opposite of the brawler&#146;s actual alignment, such as a good brawler choosing evil strikes.) At 17th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
			<p><b>Close Weapon Mastery (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a brawler&#146;s damage with close weapons increases. When wielding a close weapon, she uses the unarmed strike damage of a brawler 4 levels lower instead of the base damage for that weapon (for example, a 5th-level Medium brawler wielding a punching dagger deals 1d6 points of damage instead of the weapon&#146;s normal 1d4). If the weapon normally deals more damage than this, its damage is unchanged. This ability does not affect any other aspect of the weapon. The brawler can decide to use the weapon&#146;s base damage instead of her adjusted unarmed strike damage&#151;this must be declared before the attack roll is made.</p>
			<p><b>Awesome Blow (Ex): </b>At 16th level, the brawler can as a standard action perform an awesome blow combat maneuver against a corporeal creature of her size or smaller. If the combat maneuver check succeeds, the opponent takes damage as if the brawler hit it with the close weapon she is wielding or an unarmed strike, it is knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of the brawler&#146;s choice, and it falls prone. The brawler can only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent can&#146;t move closer to the brawler than the square it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent&#146;s move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle. (Unlike the Awesome Blow monster feat, the brawler can be of any size to use this ability.)</p>
			<p><b>Improved Awesome Blow (Ex): </b>At 20th level, the brawler can use her awesome blow ability as an attack rather than as a standard action. She may use it on creatures of any size. If the maneuver roll is a natural 20, the brawler can immediately attempt to confirm the critical by rolling another combat maneuver check with all the same modifiers as the one just rolled; if the confirmation roll is successful, the attack deals double damage, and the damage from hitting an obstacle (if any) is also doubled.</p>

At 8th level, if the winding path renegade begins her turn with the grappled condition, she can deal 2d6 points of fire damage to all other creatures in the grapple as a free action.

					<p>At 1st level, a brawler counts her total brawler levels as both fighter levels and monk levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats. She also counts as both a fighter and a monk for feats and magic items that have different effects based on whether the character has levels in those classes (such as Stunning Fist and a monk&#146;s robe). This ability does not automatically grant feats normally granted to fighters and monks based on class level, namely Stunning Fist.</p>

					<p>A brawler can take a move action to gain the benefit of a combat feat she doesn&#146;t possess. This effect lasts for 1 minute. The brawler must meet all the feat&#146;s prerequisites. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 her brawler level (minimum 1).</p>
					<p>The brawler can use this ability again before the duration expires in order to replace the previous combat feat with another choice.</p>
					<p>If a combat feat has a daily use limitation (such as Stunning Fist), any uses of that combat feat while using this ability count toward that feat&#146;s daily limit. At 6th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of two combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a swift action or two feats as a move action. She may use one of these feats to meet a prerequisite of the second feat; doing so means that she cannot replace a feat currently fulfilling another&#146;s prerequisite without also replacing those feats that require it. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
					<p>At 10th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of three combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a free action, two feats as a swift action, or three feats as a move action. She may use one of the feats to meet a prerequisite of the second and third feats, and use the second feat to meet a prerequisite of the third feat. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
					<p>At 12th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of one combat feat as an immediate action or three combat feats as a swift action. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
					<p>At 20th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of any number of combat feats as a swift action. Each feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>

					<p>At 2nd level, the winding path renegade adds 10 to the range increments of ranged weapons she wields and gains Deflect Arrows as a bonus feat. At 8th level, she can harness the power of the wind to make enormous leaps. As a move action, she can leap without attempting an Acrobatics check, jumping any distance up to her speed (upward movement counts as double, as when flying). She can leap in this way a number of times per day equal to her class level. At 14th level, when using the Deflect Arrows feat, the winding path renegade can send one projectile back at her attacker, using the same attack roll and damage roll the attacker rolled against her. Even if the deflected attack had more than one projectile (as with Manyshot), the winding path renegade sends only one projectile back at the attacker. The others are deflected as normal.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>In the sacred text Unbinding the Fetters, Irori teaches that the path to transcendence can be straight or twisted. Those who follow the straight path adhere to the traditions and techniques perfected by others who have traveled before them, while those who seek the twisted path abandon tradition and follow their own unique routes to self-perfection. Both paths can lead to the same place, but those who follow the twisted path must take care to not lose their way.</i></p>
			<p><i>Winding path renegades epitomize those who have chosen the twisted path. These brawlers initially studied at the Houses of Perfection in Jalmeray, but while they grasped the mechanical aspects of the forms, they lacked the mental discipline required by the masters of the school. Thus, they have withdrawn from their monasteries&#151;some peacefully, some not&#151;to find their own paths.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Deadly even with nothing in her hands, a brawler eschews using the fighter&#146;s heavy armor and the monk&#146;s mysticism, focusing instead on perfecting many styles of brutal unarmed combat. Versatile, agile, and able to adapt to most enemy attacks, a brawler&#146;s body is a powerful weapon.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Brawlers are maneuverable and well suited for creating flanking situations or dealing with lightly armored enemies, as well as quickly adapting to a rapidly changing battlefield.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Fighter and monk.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Brawler's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p>Skill Points at each Level: 4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A brawler is proficient with all simple weapons plus the handaxe, short sword, and weapons from the close fighter weapon group. She is proficient with light armor and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Cunning (Ex): </b>If the brawler&#146;s Intelligence score is less than 13, it counts as 13 for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of combat feats.</p>
			<p><b>Martial Flexibility (Ex): </b>A brawler can take a move action to gain the benefit of a combat feat she doesn&#146;t possess. This effect lasts for 1 minute. The brawler must meet all the feat&#146;s prerequisites. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 her brawler level (minimum 1).</p>
			<p>The brawler can use this ability again before the duration expires in order to replace the previous combat feat with another choice.</p>
			<p>If a combat feat has a daily use limitation (such as Stunning Fist), any uses of that combat feat while using this ability count toward that feat&#146;s daily limit. At 6th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of two combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a swift action or two feats as a move action. She may use one of these feats to meet a prerequisite of the second feat; doing so means that she cannot replace a feat currently fulfilling another&#146;s prerequisite without also replacing those feats that require it. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of three combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a free action, two feats as a swift action, or three feats as a move action. She may use one of the feats to meet a prerequisite of the second and third feats, and use the second feat to meet a prerequisite of the third feat. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of one combat feat as an immediate action or three combat feats as a swift action. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p>At 20th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of any number of combat feats as a swift action. Each feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Martial Training (Ex) </b>At 1st level, a brawler counts her total brawler levels as both fighter levels and monk levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats. She also counts as both a fighter and a monk for feats and magic items that have different effects based on whether the character has levels in those classes (such as Stunning Fist and a monk&#146;s robe). This ability does not automatically grant feats normally granted to fighters and monks based on class level, namely Stunning Fist.</p>
			<p><b>Unarmed Strike: </b>At 1st level, a brawler gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A brawler may attack with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a brawler may make unarmed strikes with her hands full. A brawler applies her full Strength modifier (not half ) on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.</p>
			<p>Usually, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.</p>
			<p>A brawler&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that modify either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
			<p>A brawler also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than others, as shown on Table 1&#150;5: Brawler. The unarmed damage values listed on that table are for Medium brawlers.

			<p><b>Bonus Combat Feats: </b>At 2nd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler gains a bonus combat feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be ones that affect or improve her defenses or melee attacks. The brawler must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus combat feat.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler can choose to learn a new bonus combat feat in place of a bonus combat feat she has already learned. In effect, the brawler loses the bonus combat feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A brawler can only change one feat at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time she gains a new bonus combat feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Flurry (Ex): </b>Starting at 2nd level, a brawler can make a brawler&#146;s flurry as a full-attack action. When doing so, a brawler has the Two-Weapon Fighting feat when attacking with any combination of unarmed strikes, weapons from the close fighter weapon group, or weapons with the &#147;monk&#148; special feature. She does not need to use two different weapons to use this ability.</p>
			<p>A brawler applies her full Strength modifier to her damage rolls for all attacks made with brawler&#146;s flurry, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand weapon or a weapon wielded in both hands. A brawler can substitute disarm, sunder, and trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of brawler&#146;s flurry. A brawler with natural weapons can&#146;t use such weapons as part of brawler&#146;s flurry, nor can she make natural weapon attacks in addition to her brawler&#146;s flurry attacks.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the brawler gains use of the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry. At 15th level, she gains use of the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry.</p>
			<p><b>School Focus (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a winding path renegade continues the training she left behind, gaining the benefits of the mystery taught at her old monastery. As the winding path renegade progresses in her self-guided training, she gains a deeper understanding of her chosen monastery&#146;s mystery, which grants her new powers.</p>
			<p><i>Mystery of Unblinking Flame (Su): </i>At 2nd level, the winding path renegade increases her speed by 10 feet (this is treated as an enhancement bonus). If she uses her monk moves class ability to gain fast movement, the abilities stack with each other. At 8th level, if the winding path renegade begins her turn with the grappled condition, she can deal 2d6 points of fire damage to all other creatures in the grapple as a free action. At 14th level, the winding path renegade becomes as difficult to contain as a flame. Once per day as a full-round action, she can transform into liquid flame, instantly escaping all bonds as if under the effect of freedom of movement and moving up to her speed. When moving as part of this ability, she can move through creatures&#146; squares freely and doesn&#146;t provoke attacks of opportunity. She deals 10d6 points of fire damage to any creature whose square she enters during this movement. A successful Reflex saving throw (DC = 10 + half her brawler level + her Dexterity bonus) halves this damage.</p>
			<p><i>Mystery of Unfolding Wind (Su): </i>At 2nd level, the winding path renegade adds 10 to the range increments of ranged weapons she wields and gains Deflect Arrows as a bonus feat. At 8th level, she can harness the power of the wind to make enormous leaps. As a move action, she can leap without attempting an Acrobatics check, jumping any distance up to her speed (upward movement counts as double, as when flying). She can leap in this way a number of times per day equal to her class level. At 14th level, when using the Deflect Arrows feat, the winding path renegade can send one projectile back at her attacker, using the same attack roll and damage roll the attacker rolled against her. Even if the deflected attack had more than one projectile (as with Manyshot), the winding path renegade sends only one projectile back at the attacker. The others are deflected as normal.</p>
			<p><i>Mystery of Untwisting Iron (Su): </i>At 2nd level, metal weapons and armor in the winding path renegade&#146;s possession are treated as masterwork unless they have the broken condition. At 8th level, the winding path renegade gains a bonus equal to half her level on Craft checks involving metal, and she gains the benefits of the Master Craftsman and Craft Arms and Armor feats when crafting items made of metal. At 14th level, any weapon the winding path renegade wields is treated as adamantine.</p>
			<p><b>Maneuver Training (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a brawler can select one combat maneuver to receive additional training. She gains a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks when performing that combat maneuver and a +1 bonus to her CMD when defending against that maneuver.</p>
			<p>At 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the brawler becomes further trained in another combat maneuver, gaining the above +1 bonus combat maneuver checks and to CMD. In addition, the bonuses granted by all previous maneuver training increase by 1 each. (For example, if a brawler chooses grapple at 3rd level and sunder at 7th level, her bonuses to grapple are +2 and bonuses to sunder are +1. If she then chooses bull rush upon reaching 11th level, her bonuses to grapple are +3, to sunder are +2, and to bull rush are +1.)</p>
			<p><b>Monk Moves (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a winding path renegade can use her martial flexibility ability to gain the benefits of certain monk abilities as well as combat feats. Each ability counts as one combat feat for this purpose, and the winding path renegade is treated as a monk of a level equal to her brawler level for the purpose of determining the effects of these abilities. The winding path renegade gains access to these abilities at the levels listed on the Monk Moves table above. She does not gain a ki pool, and she can&#146;t use powers that require ki. The winding path renegade must be wearing light or no armor to benefit from this ability. This ability replaces AC bonus.</p>

			<p><b>Knockout (Ex): </b>At 4th level, once per day a brawler can unleash a devastating attack that can instantly knock a target unconscious. She must announce this intent before making her attack roll. If the brawler hits and the target takes damage from the blow, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the brawler&#146;s level + the higher of the brawler&#146;s Strength or Dexterity modifier) or fall unconscious for 1d6 rounds. Each round on its turn, the unconscious target may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect as a fullround action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Creatures immune to critical hits or nonlethal damage are immune to this ability. At 10th level, the brawler may use this ability twice per day; at 16th level, she may use it three times per day.</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Strike (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 9th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 12th level, she chooses one alignment component: chaotic, evil, good, or lawful; her unarmed strikes also count as this alignment for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. (This alignment component cannot be the opposite of the brawler&#146;s actual alignment, such as a good brawler choosing evil strikes.) At 17th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
			<p><b>Close Weapon Mastery (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a brawler&#146;s damage with close weapons increases. When wielding a close weapon, she uses the unarmed strike damage of a brawler 4 levels lower instead of the base damage for that weapon (for example, a 5th-level Medium brawler wielding a punching dagger deals 1d6 points of damage instead of the weapon&#146;s normal 1d4). If the weapon normally deals more damage than this, its damage is unchanged. This ability does not affect any other aspect of the weapon. The brawler can decide to use the weapon&#146;s base damage instead of her adjusted unarmed strike damage&#151;this must be declared before the attack roll is made.</p>
			<p><b>Awesome Blow (Ex): </b>At 16th level, the brawler can as a standard action perform an awesome blow combat maneuver against a corporeal creature of her size or smaller. If the combat maneuver check succeeds, the opponent takes damage as if the brawler hit it with the close weapon she is wielding or an unarmed strike, it is knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of the brawler&#146;s choice, and it falls prone. The brawler can only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent can&#146;t move closer to the brawler than the square it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent&#146;s move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle. (Unlike the Awesome Blow monster feat, the brawler can be of any size to use this ability.)</p>
			<p><b>Improved Awesome Blow (Ex): </b>At 20th level, the brawler can use her awesome blow ability as an attack rather than as a standard action. She may use it on creatures of any size. If the maneuver roll is a natural 20, the brawler can immediately attempt to confirm the critical by rolling another combat maneuver check with all the same modifiers as the one just rolled; if the confirmation roll is successful, the attack deals double damage, and the damage from hitting an obstacle (if any) is also doubled.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The wild child works with his sworn animal friend to conquer the challenges that lay before them. This kinship could come from being lost in the wilderness and raised by animals or growing up with an exotic pet.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Deadly even with nothing in her hands, a brawler eschews using the fighter&#146;s heavy armor and the monk&#146;s mysticism, focusing instead on perfecting many styles of brutal unarmed combat. Versatile, agile, and able to adapt to most enemy attacks, a brawler&#146;s body is a powerful weapon.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Brawlers are maneuverable and well suited for creating flanking situations or dealing with lightly armored enemies, as well as quickly adapting to a rapidly changing battlefield.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Fighter and monk.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Brawler's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p>Skill Points at each Level: 4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A brawler is proficient with all simple weapons plus the handaxe, short sword, and weapons from the close fighter weapon group. She is proficient with light armor and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Animal Companion (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a wild child forms a bond with a loyal companion that accompanies the wild child on his adventures. A wild child can begin play with any of the animals available to a druid. The wild child uses his brawler level as his effective druid level for determining the abilities of his animal companion. This ability replaces the bonus combat feats gained at 2nd, 8th, 14th, and 20th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Cunning (Ex): </b>If the brawler&#146;s Intelligence score is less than 13, it counts as 13 for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of combat feats.</p>
			<p><b>Martial Flexibility (Ex): </b>A brawler can take a move action to gain the benefit of a combat feat she doesn&#146;t possess. This effect lasts for 1 minute. The brawler must meet all the feat&#146;s prerequisites. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 her brawler level (minimum 1).</p>
			<p>The brawler can use this ability again before the duration expires in order to replace the previous combat feat with another choice.</p>
			<p>If a combat feat has a daily use limitation (such as Stunning Fist), any uses of that combat feat while using this ability count toward that feat&#146;s daily limit. At 6th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of two combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a swift action or two feats as a move action. She may use one of these feats to meet a prerequisite of the second feat; doing so means that she cannot replace a feat currently fulfilling another&#146;s prerequisite without also replacing those feats that require it. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of three combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a free action, two feats as a swift action, or three feats as a move action. She may use one of the feats to meet a prerequisite of the second and third feats, and use the second feat to meet a prerequisite of the third feat. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of one combat feat as an immediate action or three combat feats as a swift action. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p>At 20th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of any number of combat feats as a swift action. Each feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Martial Training (Ex) </b>At 1st level, a brawler counts her total brawler levels as both fighter levels and monk levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats. She also counts as both a fighter and a monk for feats and magic items that have different effects based on whether the character has levels in those classes (such as Stunning Fist and a monk&#146;s robe). This ability does not automatically grant feats normally granted to fighters and monks based on class level, namely Stunning Fist.</p>
			<p><b>Unarmed Strike: </b>At 1st level, a brawler gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A brawler may attack with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a brawler may make unarmed strikes with her hands full. A brawler applies her full Strength modifier (not half ) on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.</p>
			<p>Usually, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.</p>
			<p>A brawler&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that modify either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
			<p>A brawler also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than others, as shown on Table 1&#150;5: Brawler. The unarmed damage values listed on that table are for Medium brawlers. A Small brawler deals less damage than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large brawler deals more damage; see the following table.</p>

			</table>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Flurry (Ex): </b>Starting at 2nd level, a brawler can make a brawler&#146;s flurry as a full-attack action. When doing so, a brawler has the Two-Weapon Fighting feat when attacking with any combination of unarmed strikes, weapons from the close fighter weapon group, or weapons with the &#147;monk&#148; special feature. She does not need to use two different weapons to use this ability.</p>
			<p>A brawler applies her full Strength modifier to her damage rolls for all attacks made with brawler&#146;s flurry, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand weapon or a weapon wielded in both hands. A brawler can substitute disarm, sunder, and trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of brawler&#146;s flurry. A brawler with natural weapons can&#146;t use such weapons as part of brawler&#146;s flurry, nor can she make natural weapon attacks in addition to her brawler&#146;s flurry attacks.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the brawler gains use of the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry. At 15th level, she gains use of the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry.</p>
			<p><b>Maneuver Training (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a brawler can select one combat maneuver to receive additional training. She gains a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks when performing that combat maneuver and a +1 bonus to her CMD when defending against that maneuver.</p>
			<p>At 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the brawler becomes further trained in another combat maneuver, gaining the above +1 bonus combat maneuver checks and to CMD. In addition, the bonuses granted by all previous maneuver training increase by 1 each. (For example, if a brawler chooses grapple at 3rd level and sunder at 7th level, her bonuses to grapple are +2 and bonuses to sunder are +1. If she then chooses bull rush upon reaching 11th level, her bonuses to grapple are +3, to sunder are +2, and to bull rush are +1.)</p>
			<p>Whenever the wild child chooses a new maneuver for this ability, his animal companion also learns a trick to make use of this combat maneuver. For example, if the wild child chooses maneuver training (dirty trick), his animal companion also learns a trick that allows it to use the dirty trick combat maneuver. He cannot choose any tricks that rely on ranged attacks. This bonus trick doesn&#146;t count against the animal companion&#146;s total tricks known and does not take any time or checks to train. Should the wild child gain a new animal companion (such as if the previous one dies), this new animal companion begins with the same number of bonus tricks. This ability alters maneuver training.</p>
			<p><b>AC Bonus (Ex): </b>At 4th level, when a brawler wears light or no armor, she gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC and CMD. This bonus increases by 1 at 9th, 13th, and 18th levels.</p>
			<p>These bonuses to AC apply against touch attacks. She loses these bonuses while immobilized or helpless, wearing medium or heavy armor, or carrying a medium or heavy load.</p>
			<p><b>Knockout (Ex): </b>At 4th level, once per day a brawler can unleash a devastating attack that can instantly knock a target unconscious. She must announce this intent before making her attack roll. If the brawler hits and the target takes damage from the blow, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the brawler&#146;s level + the higher of the brawler&#146;s Strength or Dexterity modifier) or fall unconscious for 1d6 rounds. Each round on its turn, the unconscious target may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect as a fullround action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Creatures immune to critical hits or nonlethal damage are immune to this ability. At 10th level, the brawler may use this ability twice per day; at 16th level, she may use it three times per day.</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Strike (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 9th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 12th level, she chooses one alignment component: chaotic, evil, good, or lawful; her unarmed strikes also count as this alignment for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. (This alignment component cannot be the opposite of the brawler&#146;s actual alignment, such as a good brawler choosing evil strikes.) At 17th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
			<p><b>Hunter&#146;s Tricks: </b>At 5th level, a wild child can expend a use of martial flexibility to use a trick from the ranger skirmisher archetype. Each time he activates this ability, the wild child can use a different hunter trick. He cannot choose any tricks that rely on ranged attacks. Activating this ability is not an action, but using the trick might require the wild child to use an action of a different type. This ability replaces close weapon mastery.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Tricks (Ex): </b>The wild child has learned a number of tricks to aid his allies and his animal companion, as well as to hinder his opponents. At 5th level and every 6 levels thereafter, the wild child learns one hunter&#146;s trick. He cannot choose any tricks that rely on ranged attacks. The wild child can use these tricks a number of times per day equal to 1/2 his brawler level + his Constitution modifier. This ability otherwise follows the rules of the hunter&#146;s tricks ability, including all action costs. This ability replaces the bonus combat feats gained at 5th, 11th, and 17th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Awesome Blow (Ex): </b>At 16th level, the brawler can as a standard action perform an awesome blow combat maneuver against a corporeal creature of her size or smaller. If the combat maneuver check succeeds, the opponent takes damage as if the brawler hit it with the close weapon she is wielding or an unarmed strike, it is knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of the brawler&#146;s choice, and it falls prone. The brawler can only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent can&#146;t move closer to the brawler than the square it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent&#146;s move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle. (Unlike the Awesome Blow monster feat, the brawler can be of any size to use this ability.)</p>
			<p><b>Improved Awesome Blow (Ex): </b>At 20th level, the brawler can use her awesome blow ability as an attack rather than as a standard action. She may use it on creatures of any size. If the maneuver roll is a natural 20, the brawler can immediately attempt to confirm the critical by rolling another combat maneuver check with all the same modifiers as the one just rolled; if the confirmation roll is successful, the attack deals double damage, and the damage from hitting an obstacle (if any) is also doubled.</p>

					<p>Starting at 2nd level, a brawler can make a brawler&#146;s flurry as a full-attack action. When doing so, a brawler has the Two-Weapon Fighting feat when attacking with any combination of unarmed strikes, weapons from the close fighter weapon group, or weapons with the &#147;monk&#148; special feature. She does not need to use two different weapons to use this ability.</p>
					<p>A brawler applies her full Strength modifier to her damage rolls for all attacks made with brawler&#146;s flurry, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand weapon or a weapon wielded in both hands. A brawler can substitute disarm, sunder, and trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of brawler&#146;s flurry. A brawler with natural weapons can&#146;t use such weapons as part of brawler&#146;s flurry, nor can she make natural weapon attacks in addition to her brawler&#146;s flurry attacks.</p>
					<p>At 8th level, the brawler gains use of the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry. At 15th level, she gains use of the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry.</p>

When she pins a creature, she can cause roots and vines to burst from the ground (no matter the surrounding terrain), allowing the verdant grappler to attempt to tie up the creature without needing to retrieve rope or use a hand to hold the rope; as usual, a tied-up creature is pinned and not helpless. The verdant grappler must remain within 30 feet of the tied-up creature, or the vines automatically release it. She can tie up only one creature at a time with green grasp.</p>

This means that a brawler may make unarmed strikes with her hands full. A brawler applies her full Strength modifier (not half ) on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.</p>
					<p>Usually, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.</p>
					<p>A brawler&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that modify either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
					<p>A brawler also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than others, as shown on Table 1&#150;5: Brawler. The unarmed damage values listed on that table are for Medium brawlers. A Small brawler deals less damage than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large brawler deals more damage; see the following table.</p>

					<p>At 1st level, a brawler counts her total brawler levels as both fighter levels and monk levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats. She also counts as both a fighter and a monk for feats and magic items that have different effects based on whether the character has levels in those classes (such as Stunning Fist and a monk&#146;s robe). This ability does not automatically grant feats normally granted to fighters and monks based on class level, namely Stunning Fist.</p>

					<p>A brawler can take a move action to gain the benefit of a combat feat she doesn&#146;t possess. This effect lasts for 1 minute. The brawler must meet all the feat&#146;s prerequisites. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 her brawler level (minimum 1).</p>
					<p>The brawler can use this ability again before the duration expires in order to replace the previous combat feat with another choice.</p>
					<p>If a combat feat has a daily use limitation (such as Stunning Fist), any uses of that combat feat while using this ability count toward that feat&#146;s daily limit. At 6th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of two combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a swift action or two feats as a move action. She may use one of these feats to meet a prerequisite of the second feat; doing so means that she cannot replace a feat currently fulfilling another&#146;s prerequisite without also replacing those feats that require it. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
					<p>At 10th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of three combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a free action, two feats as a swift action, or three feats as a move action. She may use one of the feats to meet a prerequisite of the second and third feats, and use the second feat to meet a prerequisite of the third feat. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
					<p>At 12th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of one combat feat as an immediate action or three combat feats as a swift action. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>By accepting spirits of nature into her soul, a verdant grappler can entangle her foes with tangled undergrowth.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Deadly even with nothing in her hands, a brawler eschews using the fighter&#146;s heavy armor and the monk&#146;s mysticism, focusing instead on perfecting many styles of brutal unarmed combat. Versatile, agile, and able to adapt to most enemy attacks, a brawler&#146;s body is a powerful weapon.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Brawlers are maneuverable and well suited for creating flanking situations or dealing with lightly armored enemies, as well as quickly adapting to a rapidly changing battlefield.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Fighter and monk.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A brawler is proficient with all simple weapons plus the handaxe, short sword, and weapons from the close fighter weapon group. She is proficient with light armor and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Cunning (Ex): </b>If the brawler&#146;s Intelligence score is less than 13, it counts as 13 for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of combat feats.</p>
			<p><b>Martial Flexibility (Ex): </b>A brawler can take a move action to gain the benefit of a combat feat she doesn&#146;t possess. This effect lasts for 1 minute. The brawler must meet all the feat&#146;s prerequisites. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 her brawler level (minimum 1).</p>
			<p>The brawler can use this ability again before the duration expires in order to replace the previous combat feat with another choice.</p>
			<p>If a combat feat has a daily use limitation (such as Stunning Fist), any uses of that combat feat while using this ability count toward that feat&#146;s daily limit. At 6th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of two combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a swift action or two feats as a move action. She may use one of these feats to meet a prerequisite of the second feat; doing so means that she cannot replace a feat currently fulfilling another&#146;s prerequisite without also replacing those feats that require it. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of three combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a free action, two feats as a swift action, or three feats as a move action. She may use one of the feats to meet a prerequisite of the second and third feats, and use the second feat to meet a prerequisite of the third feat. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of one combat feat as an immediate action or three combat feats as a swift action. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p>At 20th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of any number of combat feats as a swift action. Each feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Martial Training (Ex) </b>At 1st level, a brawler counts her total brawler levels as both fighter levels and monk levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats. She also counts as both a fighter and a monk for feats and magic items that have different effects based on whether the character has levels in those classes (such as Stunning Fist and a monk&#146;s robe). This ability does not automatically grant feats normally granted to fighters and monks based on class level, namely Stunning Fist.</p>
			<p><b>Unarmed Strike: </b>At 1st level, a brawler gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A brawler may attack with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a brawler may make unarmed strikes with her hands full. A brawler applies her full Strength modifier (not half ) on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.</p>
			<p>Usually, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.</p>
			<p>A brawler&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that modify either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
			<p>A brawler also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than others, as shown on Table 1&#150;5: Brawler. The unarmed damage values listed on that table are for Medium brawlers. A Small brawler deals less damage than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large brawler deals more damage; see the following table.</p>

			<p><b>Bonus Combat Feats: </b>At 2nd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler gains a bonus combat feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be ones that affect or improve her defenses or melee attacks. The brawler must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus combat feat.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler can choose to learn a new bonus combat feat in place of a bonus combat feat she has already learned. In effect, the brawler loses the bonus combat feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A brawler can only change one feat at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time she gains a new bonus combat feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Flurry (Ex): </b>Starting at 2nd level, a brawler can make a brawler&#146;s flurry as a full-attack action. When doing so, a brawler has the Two-Weapon Fighting feat when attacking with any combination of unarmed strikes, weapons from the close fighter weapon group, or weapons with the &#147;monk&#148; special feature. She does not need to use two different weapons to use this ability.</p>
			<p>A brawler applies her full Strength modifier to her damage rolls for all attacks made with brawler&#146;s flurry, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand weapon or a weapon wielded in both hands. A brawler can substitute disarm, sunder, and trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of brawler&#146;s flurry. A brawler with natural weapons can&#146;t use such weapons as part of brawler&#146;s flurry, nor can she make natural weapon attacks in addition to her brawler&#146;s flurry attacks.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the brawler gains use of the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry. At 15th level, she gains use of the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry.</p>
			<p><b>Green Grasp (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a verdant grappler gains Improved Grapple as a bonus feat. At 3rd level, she must choose grapple as her first combat maneuver for maneuver training. When she pins a creature, she can cause roots and vines to burst from the ground (no matter the surrounding terrain), allowing the verdant grappler to attempt to tie up the creature without needing to retrieve rope or use a hand to hold the rope; as usual, a tied-up creature is pinned and not helpless. The verdant grappler must remain within 30 feet of the tied-up creature, or the vines automatically release it. She can tie up only one creature at a time with green grasp.</p>
			<p><b>Maneuver Training (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a brawler can select one combat maneuver to receive additional training. She gains a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks when performing that combat maneuver and a +1 bonus to her CMD when defending against that maneuver.</p>
			<p>At 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the brawler becomes further trained in another combat maneuver, gaining the above +1 bonus combat maneuver checks and to CMD. In addition, the bonuses granted by all previous maneuver training increase by 1 each. (For example, if a brawler chooses grapple at 3rd level and sunder at 7th level, her bonuses to grapple are +2 and bonuses to sunder are +1. If she then chooses bull rush upon reaching 11th level, her bonuses to grapple are +3, to sunder are +2, and to bull rush are +1.)</p>
			<p><b>AC Bonus (Ex): </b>At 4th level, when a brawler wears light or no armor, she gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC and CMD. This bonus increases by 1 at 9th, 13th, and 18th levels.</p>
			<p>These bonuses to AC apply against touch attacks. She loses these bonuses while immobilized or helpless, wearing medium or heavy armor, or carrying a medium or heavy load.</p>
			<p><b>Knockout (Ex): </b>At 4th level, once per day a brawler can unleash a devastating attack that can instantly knock a target unconscious. She must announce this intent before making her attack roll. If the brawler hits and the target takes damage from the blow, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the brawler&#146;s level + the higher of the brawler&#146;s Strength or Dexterity modifier) or fall unconscious for 1d6 rounds. Each round on its turn, the unconscious target may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect as a fullround action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Creatures immune to critical hits or nonlethal damage are immune to this ability. At 10th level, the brawler may use this ability twice per day; at 16th level, she may use it three times per day.</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Strike (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 9th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 12th level, she chooses one alignment component: chaotic, evil, good, or lawful; her unarmed strikes also count as this alignment for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. (This alignment component cannot be the opposite of the brawler&#146;s actual alignment, such as a good brawler choosing evil strikes.) At 17th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
			<p><b>Thorny Embrace (Su): </b>At 5th level, when a verdant grappler uses green grasp to tie up a creature, she can have the roots and vines grow vicious thorns that automatically damage the tiedup creature each round at the start of the verdant grappler&#146;s turn. The thorns deal damage equal to the base unarmed strike damage of a brawler 4 levels lower than the verdant grappler.</p>
			<p><b>Phytological Anatomy (Su): </b>At 11th level, the verdant grappler transforms partially into a plant. She gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting, paralysis, poison, polymorph, sleep, and stunning effects.</p>
			<p><b>Awesome Blow (Ex): </b>At 16th level, the brawler can as a standard action perform an awesome blow combat maneuver against a corporeal creature of her size or smaller. If the combat maneuver check succeeds, the opponent takes damage as if the brawler hit it with the close weapon she is wielding or an unarmed strike, it is knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of the brawler&#146;s choice, and it falls prone. The brawler can only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent can&#146;t move closer to the brawler than the square it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent&#146;s move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle. (Unlike the Awesome Blow monster feat, the brawler can be of any size to use this ability.)</p>
			<p><b>Improved Awesome Blow (Ex): </b>At 20th level, the brawler can use her awesome blow ability as an attack rather than as a standard action. She may use it on creatures of any size. If the maneuver roll is a natural 20, the brawler can immediately attempt to confirm the critical by rolling another combat maneuver check with all the same modifiers as the one just rolled; if the confirmation roll is successful, the attack deals double damage, and the damage from hitting an obstacle (if any) is also doubled.</p>

				<name type="string">Venomous Strike (Secondary Effect)</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A venomfist&#146;s unarmed strikes deal damage as a creature one size category smaller (1d4 at first level for Medium venomfists). If she hits with her first unarmed strike in a round, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half the venomfist&#146;s brawler level + her Constitution modifier) or take an additional amount of damage equal to the venomfist&#146;s Constitution modifier. The venomfist is immune to this toxin.</p>
					<p>At 4th level, a target that fails this save must succeed at a second saving throw 1 round later or take the same amount of damage again. This effect repeats as long as the target continues to fail its saving throws, to a maximum number of rounds equal to 1 plus 1 additional round for every 4 brawler levels the venomfist has. Unlike other poisons, multiple doses of a venomfist&#146;s poison never stack; the more recent poison effect replaces the older one.</p>
					<p>At 5th level, after the venomfist gets 8 hours of rest, she can choose a secondary effect for her venom to impose. She can choose fatigued, shaken, or sickened. A creature that fails its saving throw against her venom also gains the chosen condition until it succeeds at a save against the venom or until the venom&#146;s duration ends. Once a creature succeeds at its save against the poison, it becomes immune to the secondary condition for 24 hours, but the attack still deals the extra damage.</p>
					<p>At 10th level, when the venomfist chooses the condition her venom imposes, she can also cause her venom to deal ability score damage each round instead of hit point damage. She chooses Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution, and her venom deals 1d3 points of ability score damage each round. In addition, she adds blinded, exhausted, and staggered to the list of secondary effects she can choose for her venom.</p>
					<p>At 16th level, the venomfist&#146;s venom is particularly potent. If it fails the initial save, the target must succeed at two consecutive saves before being cured of the venom, though if the first save is successful, the secondary effect ends and the creature is immune to the secondary effects of the venomfist&#146;s poison for 24 hours. In addition, the venomfist adds dazed and stunned to the list of secondary effects she can choose for her venom.</p>
					<p>This is a poison effect. The venomfist can&#146;t suppress it, but she affects only those she damages with her unarmed strikes (not those she merely touches).</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A venomfist&#146;s unarmed strikes deal damage as a creature one size category smaller (1d4 at first level for Medium venomfists). If she hits with her first unarmed strike in a round, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half the venomfist&#146;s brawler level + her Constitution modifier) or take an additional amount of damage equal to the venomfist&#146;s Constitution modifier. The venomfist is immune to this toxin.</p>
					<p>At 4th level, a target that fails this save must succeed at a second saving throw 1 round later or take the same amount of damage again. This effect repeats as long as the target continues to fail its saving throws, to a maximum number of rounds equal to 1 plus 1 additional round for every 4 brawler levels the venomfist has. Unlike other poisons, multiple doses of a venomfist&#146;s poison never stack; the more recent poison effect replaces the older one.</p>
					<p>At 5th level, after the venomfist gets 8 hours of rest, she can choose a secondary effect for her venom to impose. She can choose fatigued, shaken, or sickened. A creature that fails its saving throw against her venom also gains the chosen condition until it succeeds at a save against the venom or until the venom&#146;s duration ends. Once a creature succeeds at its save against the poison, it becomes immune to the secondary condition for 24 hours, but the attack still deals the extra damage.</p>
					<p>At 10th level, when the venomfist chooses the condition her venom imposes, she can also cause her venom to deal ability score damage each round instead of hit point damage. She chooses Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution, and her venom deals 1d3 points of ability score damage each round. In addition, she adds blinded, exhausted, and staggered to the list of secondary effects she can choose for her venom.</p>
					<p>At 16th level, the venomfist&#146;s venom is particularly potent. If it fails the initial save, the target must succeed at two consecutive saves before being cured of the venom, though if the first save is successful, the secondary effect ends and the creature is immune to the secondary effects of the venomfist&#146;s poison for 24 hours. In addition, the venomfist adds dazed and stunned to the list of secondary effects she can choose for her venom.</p>
					<p>This is a poison effect. The venomfist can&#146;t suppress it, but she affects only those she damages with her unarmed strikes (not those she merely touches).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Thanks to alchemical experiments and rigorous study of venomous creatures, a venomfist has toxic unarmed strikes.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Deadly even with nothing in her hands, a brawler eschews using the fighter&#146;s heavy armor and the monk&#146;s mysticism, focusing instead on perfecting many styles of brutal unarmed combat. Versatile, agile, and able to adapt to most enemy attacks, a brawler&#146;s body is a powerful weapon.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Brawlers are maneuverable and well suited for creating flanking situations or dealing with lightly armored enemies, as well as quickly adapting to a rapidly changing battlefield.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Fighter and monk.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Brawler's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p>Skill Points at each Level: 4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A brawler is proficient with all simple weapons plus the handaxe, short sword, and weapons from the close fighter weapon group. She is proficient with light armor and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Cunning (Ex): </b>If the brawler&#146;s Intelligence score is less than 13, it counts as 13 for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of combat feats.</p>
			<p><b>Martial Flexibility (Ex): </b>A brawler can take a move action to gain the benefit of a combat feat she doesn&#146;t possess. This effect lasts for 1 minute. The brawler must meet all the feat&#146;s prerequisites. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 her brawler level (minimum 1).</p>
			<p>The brawler can use this ability again before the duration expires in order to replace the previous combat feat with another choice.</p>
			<p>If a combat feat has a daily use limitation (such as Stunning Fist), any uses of that combat feat while using this ability count toward that feat&#146;s daily limit. At 6th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of two combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a swift action or two feats as a move action. She may use one of these feats to meet a prerequisite of the second feat; doing so means that she cannot replace a feat currently fulfilling another&#146;s prerequisite without also replacing those feats that require it. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of three combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a free action, two feats as a swift action, or three feats as a move action. She may use one of the feats to meet a prerequisite of the second and third feats, and use the second feat to meet a prerequisite of the third feat. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of one combat feat as an immediate action or three combat feats as a swift action. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p>At 20th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of any number of combat feats as a swift action. Each feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Martial Training (Ex) </b>At 1st level, a brawler counts her total brawler levels as both fighter levels and monk levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats. She also counts as both a fighter and a monk for feats and magic items that have different effects based on whether the character has levels in those classes (such as Stunning Fist and a monk&#146;s robe). This ability does not automatically grant feats normally granted to fighters and monks based on class level, namely Stunning Fist.</p>
			<p><b>Unarmed Strike: </b>At 1st level, a brawler gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A brawler may attack with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a brawler may make unarmed strikes with her hands full. A brawler applies her full Strength modifier (not half ) on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.</p>
			<p>Usually, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.</p>
			<p>A brawler&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that modify either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
			<p>A brawler also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than others, as shown on Table 1&#150;5: Brawler. The unarmed damage values listed on that table are for Medium brawlers. A Small brawler deals less damage than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large brawler deals more damage; see the following table.</p>

			<p><b>Venomous Strike (Ex): </b>A venomfist&#146;s unarmed strikes deal damage as a creature one size category smaller (1d4 at first level for Medium venomfists). If she hits with her first unarmed strike in a round, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half the venomfist&#146;s brawler level + her Constitution modifier) or take an additional amount of damage equal to the venomfist&#146;s Constitution modifier. The venomfist is immune to this toxin.</p>
			<p>At 4th level, a target that fails this save must succeed at a second saving throw 1 round later or take the same amount of damage again. This effect repeats as long as the target continues to fail its saving throws, to a maximum number of rounds equal to 1 plus 1 additional round for every 4 brawler levels the venomfist has. Unlike other poisons, multiple doses of a venomfist&#146;s poison never stack; the more recent poison effect replaces the older one.</p>
			<p>At 5th level, after the venomfist gets 8 hours of rest, she can choose a secondary effect for her venom to impose. She can choose fatigued, shaken, or sickened. A creature that fails its saving throw against her venom also gains the chosen condition until it succeeds at a save against the venom or until the venom&#146;s duration ends. Once a creature succeeds at its save against the poison, it becomes immune to the secondary condition for 24 hours, but the attack still deals the extra damage.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, when the venomfist chooses the condition her venom imposes, she can also cause her venom to deal ability score damage each round instead of hit point damage. She chooses Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution, and her venom deals 1d3 points of ability score damage each round. In addition, she adds blinded, exhausted, and staggered to the list of secondary effects she can choose for her venom.</p>
			<p>At 16th level, the venomfist&#146;s venom is particularly potent. If it fails the initial save, the target must succeed at two consecutive saves before being cured of the venom, though if the first save is successful, the secondary effect ends and the creature is immune to the secondary effects of the venomfist&#146;s poison for 24 hours. In addition, the venomfist adds dazed and stunned to the list of secondary effects she can choose for her venom.</p>
			<p>This is a poison effect. The venomfist can&#146;t suppress it, but she affects only those she damages with her unarmed strikes (not those she merely touches).</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Combat Feats: </b>At 2nd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler gains a bonus combat feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be ones that affect or improve her defenses or melee attacks. The brawler must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus combat feat.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler can choose to learn a new bonus combat feat in place of a bonus combat feat she has already learned. In effect, the brawler loses the bonus combat feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A brawler can only change one feat at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time she gains a new bonus combat feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Flurry (Ex): </b>Starting at 2nd level, a brawler can make a brawler&#146;s flurry as a full-attack action. When doing so, a brawler has the Two-Weapon Fighting feat when attacking with any combination of unarmed strikes, weapons from the close fighter weapon group, or weapons with the &#147;monk&#148; special feature. She does not need to use two different weapons to use this ability.</p>
			<p>A brawler applies her full Strength modifier to her damage rolls for all attacks made with brawler&#146;s flurry, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand weapon or a weapon wielded in both hands. A brawler can substitute disarm, sunder, and trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of brawler&#146;s flurry. A brawler with natural weapons can&#146;t use such weapons as part of brawler&#146;s flurry, nor can she make natural weapon attacks in addition to her brawler&#146;s flurry attacks.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the brawler gains use of the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry. At 15th level, she gains use of the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry.</p>
			<p><b>Maneuver Training (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a brawler can select one combat maneuver to receive additional training. She gains a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks when performing that combat maneuver and a +1 bonus to her CMD when defending against that maneuver.</p>
			<p>At 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the brawler becomes further trained in another combat maneuver, gaining the above +1 bonus combat maneuver checks and to CMD. In addition, the bonuses granted by all previous maneuver training increase by 1 each. (For example, if a brawler chooses grapple at 3rd level and sunder at 7th level, her bonuses to grapple are +2 and bonuses to sunder are +1. If she then chooses bull rush upon reaching 11th level, her bonuses to grapple are +3, to sunder are +2, and to bull rush are +1.)</p>
			<p><b>AC Bonus (Ex): </b>At 4th level, when a brawler wears light or no armor, she gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC and CMD. This bonus increases by 1 at 9th, 13th, and 18th levels.</p>
			<p>These bonuses to AC apply against touch attacks. She loses these bonuses while immobilized or helpless, wearing medium or heavy armor, or carrying a medium or heavy load.</p>
			<p><b>Knockout (Ex): </b>At 4th level, once per day a brawler can unleash a devastating attack that can instantly knock a target unconscious. She must announce this intent before making her attack roll. If the brawler hits and the target takes damage from the blow, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the brawler&#146;s level + the higher of the brawler&#146;s Strength or Dexterity modifier) or fall unconscious for 1d6 rounds. Each round on its turn, the unconscious target may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect as a fullround action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Creatures immune to critical hits or nonlethal damage are immune to this ability. At 10th level, the brawler may use this ability twice per day; at 16th level, she may use it three times per day.</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Strike (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 9th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 12th level, she chooses one alignment component: chaotic, evil, good, or lawful; her unarmed strikes also count as this alignment for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. (This alignment component cannot be the opposite of the brawler&#146;s actual alignment, such as a good brawler choosing evil strikes.) At 17th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
			<p><b>Close Weapon Mastery (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a brawler&#146;s damage with close weapons increases. When wielding a close weapon, she uses the unarmed strike damage of a brawler 4 levels lower instead of the base damage for that weapon (for example, a 5th-level Medium brawler wielding a punching dagger deals 1d6 points of damage instead of the weapon&#146;s normal 1d4). If the weapon normally deals more damage than this, its damage is unchanged. This ability does not affect any other aspect of the weapon. The brawler can decide to use the weapon&#146;s base damage instead of her adjusted unarmed strike damage&#151;this must be declared before the attack roll is made.</p>
			<p><b>Awesome Blow (Ex): </b>At 16th level, the brawler can as a standard action perform an awesome blow combat maneuver against a corporeal creature of her size or smaller. If the combat maneuver check succeeds, the opponent takes damage as if the brawler hit it with the close weapon she is wielding or an unarmed strike, it is knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of the brawler&#146;s choice, and it falls prone. The brawler can only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent can&#146;t move closer to the brawler than the square it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent&#146;s move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle. (Unlike the Awesome Blow monster feat, the brawler can be of any size to use this ability.)</p>
			<p><b>Improved Awesome Blow (Ex): </b>At 20th level, the brawler can use her awesome blow ability as an attack rather than as a standard action. She may use it on creatures of any size. If the maneuver roll is a natural 20, the brawler can immediately attempt to confirm the critical by rolling another combat maneuver check with all the same modifiers as the one just rolled; if the confirmation roll is successful, the attack deals double damage, and the damage from hitting an obstacle (if any) is also doubled.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A brawler is proficient with all simple weapons plus the handaxe, short sword, and weapons from the close fighter weapon group. She is proficient with light armor and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Cunning (Ex): </b>If the brawler&#146;s Intelligence score is less than 13, it counts as 13 for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of combat feats.</p>
			<p><b>Martial Flexibility (Ex): </b>A brawler can take a move action to gain the benefit of a combat feat she doesn&#146;t possess. This effect lasts for 1 minute. The brawler must meet all the feat&#146;s prerequisites. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 her brawler level (minimum 1).</p>
			<p>The brawler can use this ability again before the duration expires in order to replace the previous combat feat with another choice.</p>
			<p>If a combat feat has a daily use limitation (such as Stunning Fist), any uses of that combat feat while using this ability count toward that feat&#146;s daily limit. At 6th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of two combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a swift action or two feats as a move action. She may use one of these feats to meet a prerequisite of the second feat; doing so means that she cannot replace a feat currently fulfilling another&#146;s prerequisite without also replacing those feats that require it. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of three combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a free action, two feats as a swift action, or three feats as a move action. She may use one of the feats to meet a prerequisite of the second and third feats, and use the second feat to meet a prerequisite of the third feat. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of one combat feat as an immediate action or three combat feats as a swift action. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p>At 20th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of any number of combat feats as a swift action. Each feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Martial Training (Ex) </b>At 1st level, a brawler counts her total brawler levels as both fighter levels and monk levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats. She also counts as both a fighter and a monk for feats and magic items that have different effects based on whether the character has levels in those classes (such as Stunning Fist and a monk&#146;s robe). This ability does not automatically grant feats normally granted to fighters and monks based on class level, namely Stunning Fist.</p>
			<p><b>Unarmed Strike: </b>At 1st level, a brawler gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A brawler may attack with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a brawler may make unarmed strikes with her hands full. A brawler applies her full Strength modifier (not half ) on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.</p>
			<p>Usually, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.</p>
			<p>A brawler&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that modify either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
			<p>A brawler also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than others, as shown on Table 1&#150;5: Brawler. The unarmed damage values listed on that table are for Medium brawlers. A Small brawler deals less damage than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large brawler deals more damage; see the following table.</p>

			<p><b>Bonus Combat Feats: </b>At 2nd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler gains a bonus combat feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be ones that affect or improve her defenses or melee attacks. The brawler must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus combat feat.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler can choose to learn a new bonus combat feat in place of a bonus combat feat she has already learned. In effect, the brawler loses the bonus combat feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A brawler can only change one feat at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time she gains a new bonus combat feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Flurry (Ex): </b>Starting at 2nd level, a brawler can make a brawler&#146;s flurry as a full-attack action. When doing so, a brawler has the Two-Weapon Fighting feat when attacking with any combination of unarmed strikes, weapons from the close fighter weapon group, or weapons with the &#147;monk&#148; special feature. She does not need to use two different weapons to use this ability.</p>
			<p>A brawler applies her full Strength modifier to her damage rolls for all attacks made with brawler&#146;s flurry, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand weapon or a weapon wielded in both hands. A brawler can substitute disarm, sunder, and trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of brawler&#146;s flurry. A brawler with natural weapons can&#146;t use such weapons as part of brawler&#146;s flurry, nor can she make natural weapon attacks in addition to her brawler&#146;s flurry attacks.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the brawler gains use of the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry. At 15th level, she gains use of the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry.</p>
			<p><b>Beast Training (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, an Ulfen beast-wrestler selects a creature type from the Ranger Favored Enemies table. The only humanoid subtype the beast-wrestler can select is giant. She gains a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks and to her CMD against creatures of the type she selected.</p>
			<p>At 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th levels, the Ulfen beast-wrestler can select an additional type of creature. In addition, at each such interval the bonuses against any one type of creature she&#146;s chosen (including the one just selected, if so desired) increase by 2. If a specific creature falls into more than one category, the beast-wrestler&#146;s bonuses don&#146;t stack; she simply uses whichever bonus is higher. This ability replaces maneuver training.</p>
			<p><b>Beast Defenses (Ex): </b>At 4th level, when facing enemies she selected with beast training, the beast-wrestler gains a bonus to AC equal to 1/2 her beast training bonus against that creature. This ability replaces AC bonus.</p>
			<p><b>Knockout (Ex): </b>At 4th level, once per day a brawler can unleash a devastating attack that can instantly knock a target unconscious. She must announce this intent before making her attack roll. If the brawler hits and the target takes damage from the blow, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the brawler&#146;s level + the higher of the brawler&#146;s Strength or Dexterity modifier) or fall unconscious for 1d6 rounds. Each round on its turn, the unconscious target may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect as a fullround action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Creatures immune to critical hits or nonlethal damage are immune to this ability. At 10th level, the brawler may use this ability twice per day; at 16th level, she may use it three times per day.</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Strike (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 9th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 12th level, she chooses one alignment component: chaotic, evil, good, or lawful; her unarmed strikes also count as this alignment for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. (This alignment component cannot be the opposite of the brawler&#146;s actual alignment, such as a good brawler choosing evil strikes.) At 17th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
			<p><b>Close Weapon Mastery (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a brawler&#146;s damage with close weapons increases. When wielding a close weapon, she uses the unarmed strike damage of a brawler 4 levels lower instead of the base damage for that weapon (for example, a 5th-level Medium brawler wielding a punching dagger deals 1d6 points of damage instead of the weapon&#146;s normal 1d4). If the weapon normally deals more damage than this, its damage is unchanged. This ability does not affect any other aspect of the weapon. The brawler can decide to use the weapon&#146;s base damage instead of her adjusted unarmed strike damage&#151;this must be declared before the attack roll is made.</p>
			<p><b>Awesome Blow (Ex): </b>At 16th level, the brawler can as a standard action perform an awesome blow combat maneuver against a corporeal creature of her size or smaller. If the combat maneuver check succeeds, the opponent takes damage as if the brawler hit it with the close weapon she is wielding or an unarmed strike, it is knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of the brawler&#146;s choice, and it falls prone. The brawler can only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent can&#146;t move closer to the brawler than the square it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent&#146;s move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle. (Unlike the Awesome Blow monster feat, the brawler can be of any size to use this ability.)</p>
			<p><b>Improved Awesome Blow (Ex): </b>At 20th level, the brawler can use her awesome blow ability as an attack rather than as a standard action. She may use it on creatures of any size. If the maneuver roll is a natural 20, the brawler can immediately attempt to confirm the critical by rolling another combat maneuver check with all the same modifiers as the one just rolled; if the confirmation roll is successful, the attack deals double damage, and the damage from hitting an obstacle (if any) is also doubled.</p>

					<p>At 5th level, a brawler&#146;s damage with close weapons increases. When wielding a close weapon, she uses the unarmed strike damage of a brawler 4 levels lower instead of the base damage for that weapon (for example, a 5th-level Medium brawler wielding a punching dagger deals 1d6 points of damage instead of the weapon&#146;s normal 1d4). If the weapon normally deals more damage than this, its damage is unchanged. This ability does not affect any other aspect of the weapon. The brawler can decide to use the weapon&#146;s base damage instead of her adjusted unarmed strike damage&#151;this must be declared before the attack roll is made.</p>

					<p>At 5th level, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 9th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 12th level, she chooses one alignment component: chaotic, evil, good, or lawful; her unarmed strikes also count as this alignment for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. (This alignment component cannot be the opposite of the brawler&#146;s actual alignment, such as a good brawler choosing evil strikes.) At 17th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>

In addition, she can move through difficult terrain in her favored terrains at her normal speed without taking damage or suffering any other impairment, but she can&#146;t do so through difficult terrain that has been magically manipulated. At 10th and 16th levels, her enhancement bonus to her base speed increases by 10 feet within her favored terrains.

					<p>Starting at 2nd level, a brawler can make a brawler&#146;s flurry as a full-attack action. When doing so, a brawler has the Two-Weapon Fighting feat when attacking with any combination of unarmed strikes, weapons from the close fighter weapon group, or weapons with the &#147;monk&#148; special feature. She does not need to use two different weapons to use this ability.</p>
					<p>A brawler applies her full Strength modifier to her damage rolls for all attacks made with brawler&#146;s flurry, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand weapon or a weapon wielded in both hands. A brawler can substitute disarm, sunder, and trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of brawler&#146;s flurry. A brawler with natural weapons can&#146;t use such weapons as part of brawler&#146;s flurry, nor can she make natural weapon attacks in addition to her brawler&#146;s flurry attacks.</p>
					<p>At 8th level, the brawler gains use of the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry. At 15th level, she gains use of the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a brawler gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A brawler may attack with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a brawler may make unarmed strikes with her hands full. A brawler applies her full Strength modifier (not half ) on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.</p>
					<p>Usually, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.</p>
					<p>A brawler&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that modify either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
					<p>A brawler also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than others, as shown on Table 1&#150;5: Brawler. The unarmed damage values listed on that table are for Medium brawlers. A Small brawler deals less damage than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large brawler deals more damage; see the following table.</p>

					<p>At 1st level, a brawler counts her total brawler levels as both fighter levels and monk levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats. She also counts as both a fighter and a monk for feats and magic items that have different effects based on whether the character has levels in those classes (such as Stunning Fist and a monk&#146;s robe). This ability does not automatically grant feats normally granted to fighters and monks based on class level, namely Stunning Fist.</p>

					<p>A brawler can take a move action to gain the benefit of a combat feat she doesn&#146;t possess. This effect lasts for 1 minute. The brawler must meet all the feat&#146;s prerequisites. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 her brawler level (minimum 1).</p>
					<p>The brawler can use this ability again before the duration expires in order to replace the previous combat feat with another choice.</p>
					<p>If a combat feat has a daily use limitation (such as Stunning Fist), any uses of that combat feat while using this ability count toward that feat&#146;s daily limit. At 6th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of two combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a swift action or two feats as a move action. She may use one of these feats to meet a prerequisite of the second feat; doing so means that she cannot replace a feat currently fulfilling another&#146;s prerequisite without also replacing those feats that require it. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
					<p>At 10th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of three combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a free action, two feats as a swift action, or three feats as a move action. She may use one of the feats to meet a prerequisite of the second and third feats, and use the second feat to meet a prerequisite of the third feat. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
					<p>At 12th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of one combat feat as an immediate action or three combat feats as a swift action. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
					<p>At 20th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of any number of combat feats as a swift action. Each feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A turfer has a mastery over particular types of terrain.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Deadly even with nothing in her hands, a brawler eschews using the fighter&#146;s heavy armor and the monk&#146;s mysticism, focusing instead on perfecting many styles of brutal unarmed combat. Versatile, agile, and able to adapt to most enemy attacks, a brawler&#146;s body is a powerful weapon.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Brawlers are maneuverable and well suited for creating flanking situations or dealing with lightly armored enemies, as well as quickly adapting to a rapidly changing battlefield.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Fighter and monk.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Brawler's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p>Skill Points at each Level: 4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A brawler is proficient with all simple weapons plus the handaxe, short sword, and weapons from the close fighter weapon group. She is proficient with light armor and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Cunning (Ex): </b>If the brawler&#146;s Intelligence score is less than 13, it counts as 13 for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of combat feats.</p>
			<p><b>Martial Flexibility (Ex): </b>A brawler can take a move action to gain the benefit of a combat feat she doesn&#146;t possess. This effect lasts for 1 minute. The brawler must meet all the feat&#146;s prerequisites. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 her brawler level (minimum 1).</p>
			<p>The brawler can use this ability again before the duration expires in order to replace the previous combat feat with another choice.</p>
			<p>If a combat feat has a daily use limitation (such as Stunning Fist), any uses of that combat feat while using this ability count toward that feat&#146;s daily limit. At 6th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of two combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a swift action or two feats as a move action. She may use one of these feats to meet a prerequisite of the second feat; doing so means that she cannot replace a feat currently fulfilling another&#146;s prerequisite without also replacing those feats that require it. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of three combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a free action, two feats as a swift action, or three feats as a move action. She may use one of the feats to meet a prerequisite of the second and third feats, and use the second feat to meet a prerequisite of the third feat. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of one combat feat as an immediate action or three combat feats as a swift action. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p>At 20th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of any number of combat feats as a swift action. Each feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Martial Training (Ex) </b>At 1st level, a brawler counts her total brawler levels as both fighter levels and monk levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats. She also counts as both a fighter and a monk for feats and magic items that have different effects based on whether the character has levels in those classes (such as Stunning Fist and a monk&#146;s robe). This ability does not automatically grant feats normally granted to fighters and monks based on class level, namely Stunning Fist.</p>
			<p><b>Unarmed Strike: </b>At 1st level, a brawler gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A brawler may attack with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a brawler may make unarmed strikes with her hands full. A brawler applies her full Strength modifier (not half ) on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.</p>
			<p>Usually, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.</p>
			<p>A brawler&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that modify either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
			<p>A brawler also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than others, as shown on Table 1&#150;5: Brawler. The unarmed damage values listed on that table are for Medium brawlers. A Small brawler deals less damage than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large brawler deals more damage; see the following table.</p>

			<p><b>Bonus Combat Feats: </b>At 2nd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler gains a bonus combat feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be ones that affect or improve her defenses or melee attacks. The brawler must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus combat feat.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler can choose to learn a new bonus combat feat in place of a bonus combat feat she has already learned. In effect, the brawler loses the bonus combat feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A brawler can only change one feat at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time she gains a new bonus combat feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Flurry (Ex): </b>Starting at 2nd level, a brawler can make a brawler&#146;s flurry as a full-attack action. When doing so, a brawler has the Two-Weapon Fighting feat when attacking with any combination of unarmed strikes, weapons from the close fighter weapon group, or weapons with the &#147;monk&#148; special feature. She does not need to use two different weapons to use this ability.</p>
			<p>A brawler applies her full Strength modifier to her damage rolls for all attacks made with brawler&#146;s flurry, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand weapon or a weapon wielded in both hands. A brawler can substitute disarm, sunder, and trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of brawler&#146;s flurry. A brawler with natural weapons can&#146;t use such weapons as part of brawler&#146;s flurry, nor can she make natural weapon attacks in addition to her brawler&#146;s flurry attacks.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the brawler gains use of the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry. At 15th level, she gains use of the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Turf (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a turfer chooses a type of terrain from the ranger&#146;s favored terrain list. When in that type of terrain, she gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks and to CMD.</p>
			<p>At 7th level and every 4 brawler levels thereafter, the turfer chooses an additional terrain in which to gain these bonuses. Each time, in one selected terrain (including the one just chosen), her bonus on initiative checks increases by 2, and her bonus on combat maneuver checks and to CMD increases by 1.</p>
			<p><b>Terrain Mastery (Su): </b>At 4th level, a turfer gains the benefits of endure elements and a +10-foot enhancement bonus to her base speed, but only in her favored terrains. In addition, she can move through difficult terrain in her favored terrains at her normal speed without taking damage or suffering any other impairment, but she can&#146;t do so through difficult terrain that has been magically manipulated. At 10th and 16th levels, her enhancement bonus to her base speed increases by 10 feet within her favored terrains. The turfer loses this ability if she wears medium or heavy armor or carries a medium or heavy load.</p>
			<p><b>Knockout (Ex): </b>At 4th level, once per day a brawler can unleash a devastating attack that can instantly knock a target unconscious. She must announce this intent before making her attack roll. If the brawler hits and the target takes damage from the blow, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the brawler&#146;s level + the higher of the brawler&#146;s Strength or Dexterity modifier) or fall unconscious for 1d6 rounds. Each round on its turn, the unconscious target may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect as a fullround action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Creatures immune to critical hits or nonlethal damage are immune to this ability. At 10th level, the brawler may use this ability twice per day; at 16th level, she may use it three times per day.</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Strike (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 9th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 12th level, she chooses one alignment component: chaotic, evil, good, or lawful; her unarmed strikes also count as this alignment for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. (This alignment component cannot be the opposite of the brawler&#146;s actual alignment, such as a good brawler choosing evil strikes.) At 17th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
			<p><b>Close Weapon Mastery (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a brawler&#146;s damage with close weapons increases. When wielding a close weapon, she uses the unarmed strike damage of a brawler 4 levels lower instead of the base damage for that weapon (for example, a 5th-level Medium brawler wielding a punching dagger deals 1d6 points of damage instead of the weapon&#146;s normal 1d4). If the weapon normally deals more damage than this, its damage is unchanged. This ability does not affect any other aspect of the weapon. The brawler can decide to use the weapon&#146;s base damage instead of her adjusted unarmed strike damage&#151;this must be declared before the attack roll is made.</p>
			<p><b>Awesome Blow (Ex): </b>At 16th level, the brawler can as a standard action perform an awesome blow combat maneuver against a corporeal creature of her size or smaller. If the combat maneuver check succeeds, the opponent takes damage as if the brawler hit it with the close weapon she is wielding or an unarmed strike, it is knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of the brawler&#146;s choice, and it falls prone. The brawler can only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent can&#146;t move closer to the brawler than the square it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent&#146;s move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle. (Unlike the Awesome Blow monster feat, the brawler can be of any size to use this ability.)</p>
			<p><b>Improved Awesome Blow (Ex): </b>At 20th level, the brawler can use her awesome blow ability as an attack rather than as a standard action. She may use it on creatures of any size. If the maneuver roll is a natural 20, the brawler can immediately attempt to confirm the critical by rolling another combat maneuver check with all the same modifiers as the one just rolled; if the confirmation roll is successful, the attack deals double damage, and the damage from hitting an obstacle (if any) is also doubled.</p>

The strong-side boxer can carry items or wield weapons in a wrapped hand, but she takes a &#150;2 penalty on Dexteritybased skill checks that requires the use of that hand (such as Disable Device and Sleight of Hand checks). Unwrapping a hand is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity. At 3rd level, as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, a strong-side boxer can dip her wrapped hand in resin and then crushed glass or small metal spikes, which remain on her wrapped hand for 1 hour. If she chooses crushed glass, she can deal slashing damage with her unarmed strikes; if she chooses spikes, she can deal piercing damage with her unarmed strikes for the duration. Whether she chooses crushed glass or metal spikes, she deals an additional 1 point of bleed damage with her unarmed strikes. At 7th level, the bleed damage increases to 1d4. At 11th level, the bleed damage increases to 1d6. At 15th level, the bleed damage increases to 2d4. At 19th level, the bleed damage is multiplied on a critical hit. Bleed damage from this ability does not stack with bleed damage from other sources.</p>

					<p>A strong-side boxer can spend 1 minute to wrap one of her hands in rope or cord. The strong-side boxer can carry items or wield weapons in a wrapped hand, but she takes a &#150;2 penalty on Dexteritybased skill checks that requires the use of that hand (such as Disable Device and Sleight of Hand checks). Unwrapping a hand is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity. At 3rd level, as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, a strong-side boxer can dip her wrapped hand in resin and then crushed glass or small metal spikes, which remain on her wrapped hand for 1 hour. If she chooses crushed glass, she can deal slashing damage with her unarmed strikes; if she chooses spikes, she can deal piercing damage with her unarmed strikes for the duration. Whether she chooses crushed glass or metal spikes, she deals an additional 1 point of bleed damage with her unarmed strikes. At 7th level, the bleed damage increases to 1d4. At 11th level, the bleed damage increases to 1d6. At 15th level, the bleed damage increases to 2d4. At 19th level, the bleed damage is multiplied on a critical hit.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A strong-side boxer employs a unique fighting style that incorporates a rope or cord wound around her hand. The wrapped hand is known as the strong side. The other hand is kept free to deflect blows, and is known as the shield. The Zenj people of the Mwangi Expanse, who gather for large boxing tournaments, developed this style for their competitions. Many guests and visitors have witnessed these tournaments over the years, and as a result, the style has spread throughout Golarion.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Deadly even with nothing in her hands, a brawler eschews using the fighter&#146;s heavy armor and the monk&#146;s mysticism, focusing instead on perfecting many styles of brutal unarmed combat. Versatile, agile, and able to adapt to most enemy attacks, a brawler&#146;s body is a powerful weapon.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Brawlers are maneuverable and well suited for creating flanking situations or dealing with lightly armored enemies, as well as quickly adapting to a rapidly changing battlefield.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Fighter and monk.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Brawler's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p>Skill Points at each Level: 4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A brawler is proficient with all simple weapons plus the handaxe, short sword, and weapons from the close fighter weapon group. She is proficient with light armor and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Cunning (Ex): </b>If the brawler&#146;s Intelligence score is less than 13, it counts as 13 for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of combat feats.</p>
			<p><b>Martial Flexibility (Ex): </b>A brawler can take a move action to gain the benefit of a combat feat she doesn&#146;t possess. This effect lasts for 1 minute. The brawler must meet all the feat&#146;s prerequisites. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 her brawler level (minimum 1).</p>
			<p>The brawler can use this ability again before the duration expires in order to replace the previous combat feat with another choice.</p>
			<p>If a combat feat has a daily use limitation (such as Stunning Fist), any uses of that combat feat while using this ability count toward that feat&#146;s daily limit. At 6th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of two combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a swift action or two feats as a move action. She may use one of these feats to meet a prerequisite of the second feat; doing so means that she cannot replace a feat currently fulfilling another&#146;s prerequisite without also replacing those feats that require it. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of three combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a free action, two feats as a swift action, or three feats as a move action. She may use one of the feats to meet a prerequisite of the second and third feats, and use the second feat to meet a prerequisite of the third feat. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of one combat feat as an immediate action or three combat feats as a swift action. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p>At 20th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of any number of combat feats as a swift action. Each feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Martial Training (Ex) </b>At 1st level, a brawler counts her total brawler levels as both fighter levels and monk levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats. She also counts as both a fighter and a monk for feats and magic items that have different effects based on whether the character has levels in those classes (such as Stunning Fist and a monk&#146;s robe). This ability does not automatically grant feats normally granted to fighters and monks based on class level, namely Stunning Fist.</p>
			<p><b>Shield-Hand (Ex): </b>A strong-side boxer can use her off hand as if it were a buckler, gaining a +1 natural armor bonus to her AC as long as she does not use her off hand to make attacks. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1, to a maximum of +5 at 20th level. While using her off hand in this manner, the strong-side boxer treats that hand as a buckler for the purposes of other feats and abilities (though she is also considered to have a free hand).</p>
			<p><b>Strong-Side Fist (Ex): </b>A strong-side boxer can spend 1 minute to wrap one of her hands in rope or cord. The strong-side boxer can carry items or wield weapons in a wrapped hand, but she takes a &#150;2 penalty on Dexteritybased skill checks that requires the use of that hand (such as Disable Device and Sleight of Hand checks). Unwrapping a hand is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity. At 3rd level, as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, a strong-side boxer can dip her wrapped hand in resin and then crushed glass or small metal spikes, which remain on her wrapped hand for 1 hour. If she chooses crushed glass, she can deal slashing damage with her unarmed strikes; if she chooses spikes, she can deal piercing damage with her unarmed strikes for the duration. Whether she chooses crushed glass or metal spikes, she deals an additional 1 point of bleed damage with her unarmed strikes. At 7th level, the bleed damage increases to 1d4. At 11th level, the bleed damage increases to 1d6. At 15th level, the bleed damage increases to 2d4. At 19th level, the bleed damage is multiplied on a critical hit. Bleed damage from this ability does not stack with bleed damage from other sources.</p>
			<p><b>Unarmed Strike: </b>At 1st level, a brawler gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A brawler may attack with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a brawler may make unarmed strikes with her hands full. A brawler applies her full Strength modifier (not half ) on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.</p>
			<p>Usually, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.</p>
			<p>A brawler&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that modify either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
			<p>A brawler also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than others, as shown on Table 1&#150;5: Brawler. The unarmed damage values listed on that table are for Medium brawlers. A Small brawler deals less damage than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large brawler deals more damage; see the following table.</p>

			<p><b>Bonus Combat Feats: </b>At 2nd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler gains a bonus combat feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be ones that affect or improve her defenses or melee attacks. The brawler must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus combat feat.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler can choose to learn a new bonus combat feat in place of a bonus combat feat she has already learned. In effect, the brawler loses the bonus combat feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A brawler can only change one feat at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time she gains a new bonus combat feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Flurry (Ex): </b>Starting at 2nd level, a brawler can make a brawler&#146;s flurry as a full-attack action. When doing so, a brawler has the Two-Weapon Fighting feat when attacking with any combination of unarmed strikes, weapons from the close fighter weapon group, or weapons with the &#147;monk&#148; special feature. She does not need to use two different weapons to use this ability.</p>
			<p>A brawler applies her full Strength modifier to her damage rolls for all attacks made with brawler&#146;s flurry, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand weapon or a weapon wielded in both hands. A brawler can substitute disarm, sunder, and trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of brawler&#146;s flurry. A brawler with natural weapons can&#146;t use such weapons as part of brawler&#146;s flurry, nor can she make natural weapon attacks in addition to her brawler&#146;s flurry attacks.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the brawler gains use of the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry. At 15th level, she gains use of the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry.</p>
			<p><b>Knockout (Ex): </b>At 4th level, once per day a brawler can unleash a devastating attack that can instantly knock a target unconscious. She must announce this intent before making her attack roll. If the brawler hits and the target takes damage from the blow, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the brawler&#146;s level + the higher of the brawler&#146;s Strength or Dexterity modifier) or fall unconscious for 1d6 rounds. Each round on its turn, the unconscious target may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect as a fullround action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Creatures immune to critical hits or nonlethal damage are immune to this ability. At 10th level, the brawler may use this ability twice per day; at 16th level, she may use it three times per day.</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Strike (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 9th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 12th level, she chooses one alignment component: chaotic, evil, good, or lawful; her unarmed strikes also count as this alignment for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. (This alignment component cannot be the opposite of the brawler&#146;s actual alignment, such as a good brawler choosing evil strikes.) At 17th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
			<p><b>Lead Leg (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a strong-side boxer can spend 1 minute to wrap one of her legs in a chain, and can thereafter use the chain-wrapped leg both defensively and offensively. While her leg is wrapped, she is considered to be wearing a chain shirt, gaining all the appropriate bonuses and penalties. The chain can be enchanted as armor and is treated as masterwork. Once per round while wearing the chain, she can apply a +4 circumstance bonus to a trip attempt as an immediate action.</p>
			<p><b>Awesome Blow (Ex): </b>At 16th level, the brawler can as a standard action perform an awesome blow combat maneuver against a corporeal creature of her size or smaller. If the combat maneuver check succeeds, the opponent takes damage as if the brawler hit it with the close weapon she is wielding or an unarmed strike, it is knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of the brawler&#146;s choice, and it falls prone. The brawler can only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent can&#146;t move closer to the brawler than the square it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent&#146;s move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle. (Unlike the Awesome Blow monster feat, the brawler can be of any size to use this ability.)</p>
			<p><b>Improved Awesome Blow (Ex): </b>At 20th level, the brawler can use her awesome blow ability as an attack rather than as a standard action. She may use it on creatures of any size. If the maneuver roll is a natural 20, the brawler can immediately attempt to confirm the critical by rolling another combat maneuver check with all the same modifiers as the one just rolled; if the confirmation roll is successful, the attack deals double damage, and the damage from hitting an obstacle (if any) is also doubled.</p>

This works like the sleeper hold ability, but imposes a &#150;5 penalty on her grapple combat maneuver check. If the opponent succeeds at its Fortitude save, the strangler deals damage as if she had attempted the grapple check to damage her opponent; if the opponent fails its Fortitude save, it dies. Creatures that are immune to critical hits are immune to this ability. At 20th level, the strangler can attempt this as a move action instead of a standard can.

					<p>At 5th level, a brawler&#146;s damage with close weapons increases. When wielding a close weapon, she uses the unarmed strike damage of a brawler 4 levels lower instead of the base damage for that weapon (for example, a 5th-level Medium brawler wielding a punching dagger deals 1d6 points of damage instead of the weapon&#146;s normal 1d4). If the weapon normally deals more damage than this, its damage is unchanged. This ability does not affect any other aspect of the weapon. The brawler can decide to use the weapon&#146;s base damage instead of her adjusted unarmed strike damage&#151;this must be declared before the attack roll is made.</p>

			<p><i>A strangler is trained to choke the life out of her victims with her vise-like grip. Some stranglers are self-taught and are little more than brutish murderers, unhinged sociopaths, or opportunistic alley-bashers.

			<p>Deadly even with nothing in her hands, a brawler eschews using the fighter&#146;s heavy armor and the monk&#146;s mysticism, focusing instead on perfecting many styles of brutal unarmed combat. Versatile, agile, and able to adapt to most enemy attacks, a brawler&#146;s body is a powerful weapon.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Brawlers are maneuverable and well suited for creating flanking situations or dealing with lightly armored enemies, as well as quickly adapting to a rapidly changing battlefield.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Fighter and monk.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Brawler's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p>Skill Points at each Level: 4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A brawler is proficient with all simple weapons plus the handaxe, short sword, and weapons from the close fighter weapon group. She is proficient with light armor and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Cunning (Ex): </b>If the brawler&#146;s Intelligence score is less than 13, it counts as 13 for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of combat feats.</p>
			<p><b>Martial Flexibility (Ex): </b>A brawler can take a move action to gain the benefit of a combat feat she doesn&#146;t possess. This effect lasts for 1 minute. The brawler must meet all the feat&#146;s prerequisites. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 her brawler level (minimum 1).</p>
			<p>The brawler can use this ability again before the duration expires in order to replace the previous combat feat with another choice.</p>
			<p>If a combat feat has a daily use limitation (such as Stunning Fist), any uses of that combat feat while using this ability count toward that feat&#146;s daily limit. At 6th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of two combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a swift action or two feats as a move action. She may use one of these feats to meet a prerequisite of the second feat; doing so means that she cannot replace a feat currently fulfilling another&#146;s prerequisite without also replacing those feats that require it. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of three combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a free action, two feats as a swift action, or three feats as a move action. She may use one of the feats to meet a prerequisite of the second and third feats, and use the second feat to meet a prerequisite of the third feat. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of one combat feat as an immediate action or three combat feats as a swift action. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p>At 20th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of any number of combat feats as a swift action. Each feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Martial Training (Ex) </b>At 1st level, a brawler counts her total brawler levels as both fighter levels and monk levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats. She also counts as both a fighter and a monk for feats and magic items that have different effects based on whether the character has levels in those classes (such as Stunning Fist and a monk&#146;s robe). This ability does not automatically grant feats normally granted to fighters and monks based on class level, namely Stunning Fist.</p>
			<p><b>Strangle (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a strangler deals +1d6 sneak attack damage whenever she succeeds at a grapple check to damage or pin an opponent. The strangler is always considered flanking her target for the purpose of using this ability. This damage increases by +1d6 at 2nd, 8th and 15th levels. This ability replaces unarmed strike and brawler&#146;s flurry.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Combat Feats: </b>At 2nd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler gains a bonus combat feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be ones that affect or improve her defenses or melee attacks. The brawler must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus combat feat.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler can choose to learn a new bonus combat feat in place of a bonus combat feat she has already learned. In effect, the brawler loses the bonus combat feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A brawler can only change one feat at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time she gains a new bonus combat feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Practiced Strangler (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, when a strangler has the grappled condition, she does not take a &#150;4 penalty to Dexterity and does not lose her Dexterity bonus to AC. At 9th level, a grappling or grappled strangler still threatens an area and is still able to make attacks of opportunity while grappling or grappled; when pinned, she is not denied her Dexterity bonus and does not take a &#150;4 penalty to Armor Class. This ability replaces AC bonus.</p>
			<p><b>Maneuver Training (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a brawler can select one combat maneuver to receive additional training. She gains a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks when performing that combat maneuver and a +1 bonus to her CMD when defending against that maneuver.</p>
			<p>At 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the brawler becomes further trained in another combat maneuver, gaining the above +1 bonus combat maneuver checks and to CMD. In addition, the bonuses granted by all previous maneuver training increase by 1 each. (For example, if a brawler chooses grapple at 3rd level and sunder at 7th level, her bonuses to grapple are +2 and bonuses to sunder are +1. If she then chooses bull rush upon reaching 11th level, her bonuses to grapple are +3, to sunder are +2, and to bull rush are +1.)</p>
			<p><b>AC Bonus (Ex): </b>At 4th level, when a brawler wears light or no armor, she gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC and CMD. This bonus increases by 1 at 9th, 13th, and 18th levels.</p>
			<p>These bonuses to AC apply against touch attacks. She loses these bonuses while immobilized or helpless, wearing medium or heavy armor, or carrying a medium or heavy load.</p>
			<p><b>Sleeper Hold (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a strangler can instantly render a pinned opponent unconscious. This works like the knockout ability, but requires a successful grapple combat maneuver check against the pinned opponent and does not have to damage the opponent. Creatures that do not need to breathe, are immune to critical hits, or are immune to nonlethal damage are immune to this ability. At 10th level, a strangler can use this ability twice per day. At 16th level, she can use it three times per day. This alters knockout.</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Strike (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 9th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 12th level, she chooses one alignment component: chaotic, evil, good, or lawful; her unarmed strikes also count as this alignment for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. (This alignment component cannot be the opposite of the brawler&#146;s actual alignment, such as a good brawler choosing evil strikes.) At 17th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
			<p><b>Close Weapon Mastery (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a brawler&#146;s damage with close weapons increases. When wielding a close weapon, she uses the unarmed strike damage of a brawler 4 levels lower instead of the base damage for that weapon (for example, a 5th-level Medium brawler wielding a punching dagger deals 1d6 points of damage instead of the weapon&#146;s normal 1d4). If the weapon normally deals more damage than this, its damage is unchanged. This ability does not affect any other aspect of the weapon. The brawler can decide to use the weapon&#146;s base damage instead of her adjusted unarmed strike damage&#151;this must be declared before the attack roll is made.</p>
			<p><b>Neckbreaker (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a strangler can attempt to instantly kill a pinned opponent as a standard action. This works like the sleeper hold ability, but imposes a &#150;5 penalty on her grapple combat maneuver check. If the opponent succeeds at its Fortitude save, the strangler deals damage as if she had attempted the grapple check to damage her opponent; if the opponent fails its Fortitude save, it dies. Creatures that are immune to critical hits are immune to this ability. At 20th level, the strangler can attempt this as a move action instead of a standard can. This ability replaces awesome blow and improved awesome blow.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 20th level, the brawler can use her awesome blow ability as an attack rather than as a standard action. She may use it on creatures of any size. If the maneuver roll is a natural 20, the brawler can immediately attempt to confirm the critical by rolling another combat maneuver check with all the same modifiers as the one just rolled; if the confirmation roll is successful, the attack deals double damage, and the damage from hitting an obstacle (if any) is also doubled.</p>

				<name type="string">Awesome Blow</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 16th level, the brawler can as a standard action perform an awesome blow combat maneuver against a corporeal creature of her size or smaller. If the combat maneuver check succeeds, the opponent takes damage as if the brawler hit it with the close weapon she is wielding or an unarmed strike, it is knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of the brawler&#146;s choice, and it falls prone. The brawler can only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent can&#146;t move closer to the brawler than the square it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent&#146;s move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle. (Unlike the Awesome Blow monster feat, the brawler can be of any size to use this ability.)</p>

				<name type="string">Exploit Weakness</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 5th level, as a swift action a steel-breaker can observe a creature or object to find its weak point by succeeding at a Wisdom check, adding her brawler level against a DC of 10 + the object&#146;s hardness or the target&#146;s CR. If it succeeds, the steel-breaker gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls until the end of her turn, and any attacks she makes until the end of her turn ignore the creature or object&#146;s DR or hardness.</p>
					<p>A steel-breaker can instead use this ability as a swift action to analyze the movements and expressions of one creature within 30 feet, granting a bonus on Sense Motive checks and Reflex saving throws, as well as a dodge bonus to AC against that opponent equal to 1/2 her brawler level until the start of her next turn. This ability replaces brawler&#146;s strike.</p>

				<level type="number">4</level>
				<name type="string">Knockout (1/day)</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, once per day a brawler can unleash a devastating attack that can instantly knock a target unconscious. She must announce this intent before making her attack roll. If the brawler hits and the target takes damage from the blow, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the brawler&#146;s level + the higher of the brawler&#146;s Strength or Dexterity modifier) or fall unconscious for 1d6 rounds. Each round on its turn, the unconscious target may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect as a fullround action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Creatures immune to critical hits or nonlethal damage are immune to this ability. At 10th level, the brawler may use this ability twice per day; at 16th level, she may use it three times per day.</p>

				<name type="string">Brawler&#146;s Flurry</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Starting at 2nd level, a brawler can make a brawler&#146;s flurry as a full-attack action. When doing so, a brawler has the Two-Weapon Fighting feat when attacking with any combination of unarmed strikes, weapons from the close fighter weapon group, or weapons with the &#147;monk&#148; special feature. She does not need to use two different weapons to use this ability.</p>
					<p>A brawler applies her full Strength modifier to her damage rolls for all attacks made with brawler&#146;s flurry, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand weapon or a weapon wielded in both hands. A brawler can substitute disarm, sunder, and trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of brawler&#146;s flurry. A brawler with natural weapons can&#146;t use such weapons as part of brawler&#146;s flurry, nor can she make natural weapon attacks in addition to her brawler&#146;s flurry attacks.</p>
					<p>At 8th level, the brawler gains use of the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry. At 15th level, she gains use of the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry.</p>

				<name type="string">Unarmed Strike</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a brawler gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A brawler may attack with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a brawler may make unarmed strikes with her hands full. A brawler applies her full Strength modifier (not half ) on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.</p>
					<p>Usually, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.</p>
					<p>A brawler&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that modify either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
					<p>A brawler also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than others, as shown on Table 1&#150;5: Brawler. The unarmed damage values listed on that table are for Medium brawlers. A Small brawler deals less damage than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large brawler deals more damage; see the following table.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The steel-breaker studies destruction and practices it as an art form. She knows every defense has a breaking point, and can shatter those defenses with carefully planned strikes.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Deadly even with nothing in her hands, a brawler eschews using the fighter&#146;s heavy armor and the monk&#146;s mysticism, focusing instead on perfecting many styles of brutal unarmed combat. Versatile, agile, and able to adapt to most enemy attacks, a brawler&#146;s body is a powerful weapon.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Brawlers are maneuverable and well suited for creating flanking situations or dealing with lightly armored enemies, as well as quickly adapting to a rapidly changing battlefield.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Fighter and monk.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Brawler's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p>Skill Points at each Level: 4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A brawler is proficient with all simple weapons plus the handaxe, short sword, and weapons from the close fighter weapon group. She is proficient with light armor and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Cunning (Ex): </b>If the brawler&#146;s Intelligence score is less than 13, it counts as 13 for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of combat feats.</p>
			<p><b>Martial Flexibility (Ex): </b>A brawler can take a move action to gain the benefit of a combat feat she doesn&#146;t possess. This effect lasts for 1 minute. The brawler must meet all the feat&#146;s prerequisites. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 her brawler level (minimum 1).</p>
			<p>The brawler can use this ability again before the duration expires in order to replace the previous combat feat with another choice.</p>
			<p>If a combat feat has a daily use limitation (such as Stunning Fist), any uses of that combat feat while using this ability count toward that feat&#146;s daily limit. At 6th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of two combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a swift action or two feats as a move action. She may use one of these feats to meet a prerequisite of the second feat; doing so means that she cannot replace a feat currently fulfilling another&#146;s prerequisite without also replacing those feats that require it. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of three combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a free action, two feats as a swift action, or three feats as a move action. She may use one of the feats to meet a prerequisite of the second and third feats, and use the second feat to meet a prerequisite of the third feat. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of one combat feat as an immediate action or three combat feats as a swift action. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p>At 20th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of any number of combat feats as a swift action. Each feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Martial Training (Ex) </b>At 1st level, a brawler counts her total brawler levels as both fighter levels and monk levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats. She also counts as both a fighter and a monk for feats and magic items that have different effects based on whether the character has levels in those classes (such as Stunning Fist and a monk&#146;s robe). This ability does not automatically grant feats normally granted to fighters and monks based on class level, namely Stunning Fist.</p>
			<p><b>Unarmed Strike: </b>At 1st level, a brawler gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A brawler may attack with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a brawler may make unarmed strikes with her hands full. A brawler applies her full Strength modifier (not half ) on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.</p>
			<p>Usually, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.</p>
			<p>A brawler&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that modify either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
			<p>A brawler also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than others, as shown on Table 1&#150;5: Brawler. The unarmed damage values listed on that table are for Medium brawlers. A Small brawler deals less damage than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large brawler deals more damage; see the following table.</p>

			<p><b>Bonus Combat Feats: </b>At 2nd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler gains a bonus combat feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be ones that affect or improve her defenses or melee attacks. The brawler must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus combat feat.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler can choose to learn a new bonus combat feat in place of a bonus combat feat she has already learned. In effect, the brawler loses the bonus combat feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A brawler can only change one feat at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time she gains a new bonus combat feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Flurry (Ex): </b>Starting at 2nd level, a brawler can make a brawler&#146;s flurry as a full-attack action. When doing so, a brawler has the Two-Weapon Fighting feat when attacking with any combination of unarmed strikes, weapons from the close fighter weapon group, or weapons with the &#147;monk&#148; special feature. She does not need to use two different weapons to use this ability.</p>
			<p>A brawler applies her full Strength modifier to her damage rolls for all attacks made with brawler&#146;s flurry, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand weapon or a weapon wielded in both hands. A brawler can substitute disarm, sunder, and trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of brawler&#146;s flurry. A brawler with natural weapons can&#146;t use such weapons as part of brawler&#146;s flurry, nor can she make natural weapon attacks in addition to her brawler&#146;s flurry attacks.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the brawler gains use of the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry. At 15th level, she gains use of the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry.</p>
			<p><b>Maneuver Training (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a brawler can select one combat maneuver to receive additional training. She gains a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks when performing that combat maneuver and a +1 bonus to her CMD when defending against that maneuver.</p>
			<p>At 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the brawler becomes further trained in another combat maneuver, gaining the above +1 bonus combat maneuver checks and to CMD. In addition, the bonuses granted by all previous maneuver training increase by 1 each. (For example, if a brawler chooses grapple at 3rd level and sunder at 7th level, her bonuses to grapple are +2 and bonuses to sunder are +1. If she then chooses bull rush upon reaching 11th level, her bonuses to grapple are +3, to sunder are +2, and to bull rush are +1.)</p>
			<p><b>Sunder Training (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a steel-breaker receives additional training in sunder combat maneuvers. She gains a +2 bonus when attempting a sunder combat maneuver checks and a +2 bonus to her CMD when defending against this maneuver. At 7th level, these bonuses increase by 1, and she gains a +2 bonus on disarm combat maneuver checks and a +2 bonus to her CMD when defending against a disarm maneuver. At 11th, 15th, and 19th levels, all of these bonuses increase by 1. This ability alters maneuver training.</p>
			<p><b>AC Bonus (Ex): </b>At 4th level, when a brawler wears light or no armor, she gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC and CMD. This bonus increases by 1 at 9th, 13th, and 18th levels.</p>
			<p>These bonuses to AC apply against touch attacks. She loses these bonuses while immobilized or helpless, wearing medium or heavy armor, or carrying a medium or heavy load.</p>
			<p><b>Knockout (Ex): </b>At 4th level, once per day a brawler can unleash a devastating attack that can instantly knock a target unconscious. She must announce this intent before making her attack roll. If the brawler hits and the target takes damage from the blow, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the brawler&#146;s level + the higher of the brawler&#146;s Strength or Dexterity modifier) or fall unconscious for 1d6 rounds. Each round on its turn, the unconscious target may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect as a fullround action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Creatures immune to critical hits or nonlethal damage are immune to this ability. At 10th level, the brawler may use this ability twice per day; at 16th level, she may use it three times per day.</p>
			<p><b>Exploit Weakness (Ex): </b>At 5th level, as a swift action a steel-breaker can observe a creature or object to find its weak point by succeeding at a Wisdom check, adding her brawler level against a DC of 10 + the object&#146;s hardness or the target&#146;s CR. If it succeeds, the steel-breaker gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls until the end of her turn, and any attacks she makes until the end of her turn ignore the creature or object&#146;s DR or hardness.</p>
			<p>A steel-breaker can instead use this ability as a swift action to analyze the movements and expressions of one creature within 30 feet, granting a bonus on Sense Motive checks and Reflex saving throws, as well as a dodge bonus to AC against that opponent equal to 1/2 her brawler level until the start of her next turn. This ability replaces brawler&#146;s strike.</p>
			<p><b>Close Weapon Mastery (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a brawler&#146;s damage with close weapons increases. When wielding a close weapon, she uses the unarmed strike damage of a brawler 4 levels lower instead of the base damage for that weapon (for example, a 5th-level Medium brawler wielding a punching dagger deals 1d6 points of damage instead of the weapon&#146;s normal 1d4). If the weapon normally deals more damage than this, its damage is unchanged. This ability does not affect any other aspect of the weapon. The brawler can decide to use the weapon&#146;s base damage instead of her adjusted unarmed strike damage&#151;this must be declared before the attack roll is made.</p>
			<p><b>Awesome Blow (Ex): </b>At 16th level, the brawler can as a standard action perform an awesome blow combat maneuver against a corporeal creature of her size or smaller. If the combat maneuver check succeeds, the opponent takes damage as if the brawler hit it with the close weapon she is wielding or an unarmed strike, it is knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of the brawler&#146;s choice, and it falls prone. The brawler can only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent can&#146;t move closer to the brawler than the square it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent&#146;s move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle. (Unlike the Awesome Blow monster feat, the brawler can be of any size to use this ability.)</p>
			<p><b>Improved Awesome Blow (Ex): </b>At 20th level, the brawler can use her awesome blow ability as an attack rather than as a standard action. She may use it on creatures of any size. If the maneuver roll is a natural 20, the brawler can immediately attempt to confirm the critical by rolling another combat maneuver check with all the same modifiers as the one just rolled; if the confirmation roll is successful, the attack deals double damage, and the damage from hitting an obstacle (if any) is also doubled.</p>

					<p>A brawler applies her full Strength modifier to her damage rolls for all attacks made with brawler&#146;s flurry, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand weapon or a weapon wielded in both hands.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>With her lightning quickness and guile, a snakebite striker keeps her foes&#146; attention focused on her, because any one of her feints might be an actual attack. By giving up some of a brawler&#146;s versatility, she increases her damage potential and exposes opponents to deadly and unexpected strikes.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Deadly even with nothing in her hands, a brawler eschews using the fighter&#146;s heavy armor and the monk&#146;s mysticism, focusing instead on perfecting many styles of brutal unarmed combat. Versatile, agile, and able to adapt to most enemy attacks, a brawler&#146;s body is a powerful weapon.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Brawlers are maneuverable and well suited for creating flanking situations or dealing with lightly armored enemies, as well as quickly adapting to a rapidly changing battlefield.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Fighter and monk.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Brawler's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p>Skill Points at each Level: 4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A brawler is proficient with all simple weapons plus the handaxe, short sword, and weapons from the close fighter weapon group. She is proficient with light armor and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Cunning (Ex): </b>If the brawler&#146;s Intelligence score is less than 13, it counts as 13 for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of combat feats.</p>
			<p><b>Martial Training (Ex) </b>At 1st level, a brawler counts her total brawler levels as both fighter levels and monk levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats. She also counts as both a fighter and a monk for feats and magic items that have different effects based on whether the character has levels in those classes (such as Stunning Fist and a monk&#146;s robe). This ability does not automatically grant feats normally granted to fighters and monks based on class level, namely Stunning Fist.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack (Ex): </b>At 1st level, the snakebite striker can make a sneak attack. This is as the rogue ability of the same name. At 1st level, her sneak attack damage is +1d6. This increases by 1d6 at 6th, 10th, 12th, and 20th levels. If she gets a sneak attack bonus from another source, the bonuses on damage stack. This ability replaces martial flexibility.</p>
			<p><b>Unarmed Strike: </b>At 1st level, a brawler gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A brawler may attack with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a brawler may make unarmed strikes with her hands full. A brawler applies her full Strength modifier (not half ) on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.</p>
			<p>Usually, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.</p>
			<p>A brawler&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that modify either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
			<p>A brawler also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than others, as shown on Table 1&#150;5: Brawler. The unarmed damage values listed on that table are for Medium brawlers. A Small brawler deals less damage than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large brawler deals more damage; see the following table.</p>

			<p><b>Bonus Combat Feats: </b>At 2nd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler gains a bonus combat feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be ones that affect or improve her defenses or melee attacks. The brawler must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus combat feat.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler can choose to learn a new bonus combat feat in place of a bonus combat feat she has already learned. In effect, the brawler loses the bonus combat feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A brawler can only change one feat at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time she gains a new bonus combat feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Flurry (Ex): </b>Starting at 2nd level, a brawler can make a brawler&#146;s flurry as a full-attack action. When doing so, a brawler has the Two-Weapon Fighting feat when attacking with any combination of unarmed strikes, weapons from the close fighter weapon group, or weapons with the &#147;monk&#148; special feature. She does not need to use two different weapons to use this ability.</p>
			<p>A brawler applies her full Strength modifier to her damage rolls for all attacks made with brawler&#146;s flurry, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand weapon or a weapon wielded in both hands. A brawler can substitute disarm, sunder, and trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of brawler&#146;s flurry. A brawler with natural weapons can&#146;t use such weapons as part of brawler&#146;s flurry, nor can she make natural weapon attacks in addition to her brawler&#146;s flurry attacks.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the brawler gains use of the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry. At 15th level, she gains use of the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry.</p>
			<p><b>Maneuver Training (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a brawler can select one combat maneuver to receive additional training. She gains a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks when performing that combat maneuver and a +1 bonus to her CMD when defending against that maneuver.</p>
			<p>At 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the brawler becomes further trained in another combat maneuver, gaining the above +1 bonus combat maneuver checks and to CMD. In addition, the bonuses granted by all previous maneuver training increase by 1 each. (For example, if a brawler chooses grapple at 3rd level and sunder at 7th level, her bonuses to grapple are +2 and bonuses to sunder are +1. If she then chooses bull rush upon reaching 11th level, her bonuses to grapple are +3, to sunder are +2, and to bull rush are +1.)</p>
			<p><b>Snake Feint (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a snakebite striker who uses a standard action to move can combine that move with a feint. If she is able to feint as a move action (such as from having the Improved Feint feat), she can combine a move action to move with her feint. At 11th level, once per round she can declare her square and one adjacent square as the origin of her attacks until her next turn (allowing her to use one or both squares to determine whether she or allies are flanking an opponent). At 15th level, she counts an additional adjacent square for this purpose. This ability replaces maneuver training gained at 3rd and 7th levels.</p>
			<p><b>AC Bonus (Ex): </b>At 4th level, when a brawler wears light or no armor, she gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC and CMD. This bonus increases by 1 at 9th, 13th, and 18th levels.</p>
			<p>These bonuses to AC apply against touch attacks. She loses these bonuses while immobilized or helpless, wearing medium or heavy armor, or carrying a medium or heavy load.</p>
			<p><b>Knockout (Ex): </b>At 4th level, once per day a brawler can unleash a devastating attack that can instantly knock a target unconscious. She must announce this intent before making her attack roll. If the brawler hits and the target takes damage from the blow, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the brawler&#146;s level + the higher of the brawler&#146;s Strength or Dexterity modifier) or fall unconscious for 1d6 rounds. Each round on its turn, the unconscious target may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect as a fullround action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Creatures immune to critical hits or nonlethal damage are immune to this ability. At 10th level, the brawler may use this ability twice per day; at 16th level, she may use it three times per day.</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Strike (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 9th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 12th level, she chooses one alignment component: chaotic, evil, good, or lawful; her unarmed strikes also count as this alignment for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. (This alignment component cannot be the opposite of the brawler&#146;s actual alignment, such as a good brawler choosing evil strikes.) At 17th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
			<p><b>Close Weapon Mastery (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a brawler&#146;s damage with close weapons increases. When wielding a close weapon, she uses the unarmed strike damage of a brawler 4 levels lower instead of the base damage for that weapon (for example, a 5th-level Medium brawler wielding a punching dagger deals 1d6 points of damage instead of the weapon&#146;s normal 1d4). If the weapon normally deals more damage than this, its damage is unchanged. This ability does not affect any other aspect of the weapon. The brawler can decide to use the weapon&#146;s base damage instead of her adjusted unarmed strike damage&#151;this must be declared before the attack roll is made.</p>
			<p><b>Opportunist (Ex): </b>At 11th level, once per round the snakebite striker can make an attack of opportunity against an opponent who has just been struck for damage in melee by another character. This attack counts as an attack of opportunity for that round. She cannot use this ability more than once per round, even if she has the Combat Reflexes feat or a similar ability. At 19th level, she can use this ability twice per round. This ability replaces the maneuver training gained at 11th and 19th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Awesome Blow (Ex): </b>At 16th level, the brawler can as a standard action perform an awesome blow combat maneuver against a corporeal creature of her size or smaller. If the combat maneuver check succeeds, the opponent takes damage as if the brawler hit it with the close weapon she is wielding or an unarmed strike, it is knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of the brawler&#146;s choice, and it falls prone. The brawler can only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent can&#146;t move closer to the brawler than the square it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent&#146;s move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle. (Unlike the Awesome Blow monster feat, the brawler can be of any size to use this ability.)</p>
			<p><b>Improved Awesome Blow (Ex): </b>At 20th level, the brawler can use her awesome blow ability as an attack rather than as a standard action. She may use it on creatures of any size. If the maneuver roll is a natural 20, the brawler can immediately attempt to confirm the critical by rolling another combat maneuver check with all the same modifiers as the one just rolled; if the confirmation roll is successful, the attack deals double damage, and the damage from hitting an obstacle (if any) is also doubled.</p>

				<name type="string">Returning Shield</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 5th level, a shield champion can throw a shield so it ricochets off her target (and possibly other solid objects) to return to her at the end of her turn. This ability functions whether or not the shield champion hits her opponent or moves on her turn. The shield deals no damage to targets it bounces off other than the original target of the shield champion&#146;s attack. Other circumstances can prevent the shield from returning to the shield champion, such as an opponent using a readied action to catch the shield, or the shield sticking to a mimic&#146;s adhesive. The shield champion can opt to not have a thrown shield return to her, in which case it falls to the ground as it normally would. If the shield has the returning weapon special ability, she can use either that or this ability.</p>
					<p>If a shield champion has additional attacks from a high base attack bonus, these additional attacks can be ricochets off an earlier target. The distance to each additional target adds to the total range of the shield, and range penalties apply, but there are no additional penalties for attacking in this manner. Because ricocheting attacks are treated as separate attacks, effects and modifiers that only apply to one attack roll (such as true strike) only apply to the first attack and not to the others. A shield champion can throw a shield as part of a brawler&#146;s flurry.</p>
					<p>At 9th level, a shield champion gains Greater Shield Focus as a bonus feat. She must meet all prerequisites before selecting that feat. At 12th level, a shield champion can use her unarmed strike damage when dealing damage with a shield (whether in melee or thrown) or the shield&#146;s damage, whichever is greater. At 17th level, by ricocheting her shield off a nearby surface before hitting your intended target, she can treat that surface as the origin square of the attack to determine whether the target is flanked and whether the target gains a cover bonus to its AC. She can use this ability to attack a creature with total concealment from her if she knows what square it occupies, but the attack still has a 50% miss chance. This ability replaces brawler&#146;s strike.</p>

A shield champion is treated as having the Far Shot feat for the purpose of determining range increment penalties for throwing a shield.</p>

					<p>At 8th level, the brawler gains use of the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry. At 15th level, she gains use of the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a brawler gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A brawler may attack with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a brawler may make unarmed strikes with her hands full. A brawler applies her full Strength modifier (not half ) on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.</p>
					<p>Usually, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.</p>
					<p>A brawler&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that modify either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
					<p>A brawler also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than others, as shown on Table 1&#150;5: Brawler. The unarmed damage values listed on that table are for Medium brawlers. A Small brawler deals less damage than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large brawler deals more damage; see the following table.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Stalwart in battle, a shield champion has perfected an entire martial discipline relying on only her hand-to-hand fighting skills and her ever-present shield. What she forgoes in weapon versatility and improved combat maneuvering, she makes up for in her ability to turn her defense into a weapon.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Deadly even with nothing in her hands, a brawler eschews using the fighter&#146;s heavy armor and the monk&#146;s mysticism, focusing instead on perfecting many styles of brutal unarmed combat. Versatile, agile, and able to adapt to most enemy attacks, a brawler&#146;s body is a powerful weapon.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Brawlers are maneuverable and well suited for creating flanking situations or dealing with lightly armored enemies, as well as quickly adapting to a rapidly changing battlefield.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Fighter and monk.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Brawler's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p>Skill Points at each Level: 4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p>At 10th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of three combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a free action, two feats as a swift action, or three feats as a move action. She may use one of the feats to meet a prerequisite of the second and third feats, and use the second feat to meet a prerequisite of the third feat.

			<p><b>Martial Training (Ex) </b>At 1st level, a brawler counts her total brawler levels as both fighter levels and monk levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats.

This ability does not automatically grant feats normally granted to fighters and monks based on class level, namely Stunning Fist.</p>
			<p><b>Unarmed Strike: </b>At 1st level, a brawler gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A brawler may attack with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a brawler may make unarmed strikes with her hands full. A brawler applies her full Strength modifier (not half ) on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.</p>
			<p>Usually, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.</p>
			<p>A brawler&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that modify either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
			<p>A brawler also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than others, as shown on Table 1&#150;5: Brawler. The unarmed damage values listed on that table are for Medium brawlers.

			<p><b>Bonus Combat Feats: </b>At 2nd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler gains a bonus combat feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be ones that affect or improve her defenses or melee attacks. The brawler must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus combat feat.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler can choose to learn a new bonus combat feat in place of a bonus combat feat she has already learned. In effect, the brawler loses the bonus combat feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A brawler can only change one feat at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time she gains a new bonus combat feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Flurry (Ex): </b>Starting at 2nd level, a brawler can make a brawler&#146;s flurry as a full-attack action. When doing so, a brawler has the Two-Weapon Fighting feat when attacking with any combination of unarmed strikes, weapons from the close fighter weapon group, or weapons with the &#147;monk&#148; special feature. She does not need to use two different weapons to use this ability.</p>
			<p>A brawler applies her full Strength modifier to her damage rolls for all attacks made with brawler&#146;s flurry, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand weapon or a weapon wielded in both hands. A brawler can substitute disarm, sunder, and trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of brawler&#146;s flurry. A brawler with natural weapons can&#146;t use such weapons as part of brawler&#146;s flurry, nor can she make natural weapon attacks in addition to her brawler&#146;s flurry attacks.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the brawler gains use of the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry. At 15th level, she gains use of the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry.</p>
			<p><b>Throw Shield (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a shield champion can throw a heavy or light shield as a normal (nonimprovised) thrown weapon with a range increment of 10 feet or the shield&#146;s range increment, whichever is greater. The thrown shield deals the same damage as a shield bash, and any damage increases from shield spikes apply to this attack. A shield champion is treated as having the Far Shot feat for the purpose of determining range increment penalties for throwing a shield.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a shield champion can use a thrown shield to perform a bull rush, dirty trick, disarm, reposition, or trip combat maneuver as if she were making a melee shield bash attack. At 11th level, a shield champion gains Shield Master as a bonus feat. She must meet all prerequisites before selecting that feat.</p>
			<p><b>AC Bonus (Ex): </b>At 4th level, when a brawler wears light or no armor, she gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC and CMD. This bonus increases by 1 at 9th, 13th, and 18th levels.</p>
			<p>These bonuses to AC apply against touch attacks. She loses these bonuses while immobilized or helpless, wearing medium or heavy armor, or carrying a medium or heavy load.</p>
			<p><b>Knockout (Ex): </b>At 4th level, once per day a brawler can unleash a devastating attack that can instantly knock a target unconscious. She must announce this intent before making her attack roll. If the brawler hits and the target takes damage from the blow, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the brawler&#146;s level + the higher of the brawler&#146;s Strength or Dexterity modifier) or fall unconscious for 1d6 rounds. Each round on its turn, the unconscious target may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect as a fullround action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Creatures immune to critical hits or nonlethal damage are immune to this ability. At 10th level, the brawler may use this ability twice per day; at 16th level, she may use it three times per day.</p>
			<p><b>Returning Shield (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a shield champion can throw a shield so it ricochets off her target (and possibly other solid objects) to return to her at the end of her turn. This ability functions whether or not the shield champion hits her opponent or moves on her turn. The shield deals no damage to targets it bounces off other than the original target of the shield champion&#146;s attack. Other circumstances can prevent the shield from returning to the shield champion, such as an opponent using a readied action to catch the shield, or the shield sticking to a mimic&#146;s adhesive. The shield champion can opt to not have a thrown shield return to her, in which case it falls to the ground as it normally would. If the shield has the returning weapon special ability, she can use either that or this ability.</p>
			<p>If a shield champion has additional attacks from a high base attack bonus, these additional attacks can be ricochets off an earlier target. The distance to each additional target adds to the total range of the shield, and range penalties apply, but there are no additional penalties for attacking in this manner. Because ricocheting attacks are treated as separate attacks, effects and modifiers that only apply to one attack roll (such as true strike) only apply to the first attack and not to the others. A shield champion can throw a shield as part of a brawler&#146;s flurry.</p>
			<p>At 9th level, a shield champion gains Greater Shield Focus as a bonus feat. She must meet all prerequisites before selecting that feat. At 12th level, a shield champion can use her unarmed strike damage when dealing damage with a shield (whether in melee or thrown) or the shield&#146;s damage, whichever is greater. At 17th level, by ricocheting her shield off a nearby surface before hitting your intended target, she can treat that surface as the origin square of the attack to determine whether the target is flanked and whether the target gains a cover bonus to its AC. She can use this ability to attack a creature with total concealment from her if she knows what square it occupies, but the attack still has a 50% miss chance. This ability replaces brawler&#146;s strike.</p>
			<p><b>Close Weapon Mastery (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a brawler&#146;s damage with close weapons increases. When wielding a close weapon, she uses the unarmed strike damage of a brawler 4 levels lower instead of the base damage for that weapon (for example, a 5th-level Medium brawler wielding a punching dagger deals 1d6 points of damage instead of the weapon&#146;s normal 1d4). If the weapon normally deals more damage than this, its damage is unchanged. This ability does not affect any other aspect of the weapon. The brawler can decide to use the weapon&#146;s base damage instead of her adjusted unarmed strike damage&#151;this must be declared before the attack roll is made.</p>
			<p><b>Champion Defense (Ex): </b>At 15th level, once per day when she would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat from a weapon, unarmed, or natural attack, the shield champion can attempt to absorb all the damage with her shield. To use this ability, the shield champion must attempt a Fortitude saving throw, with the DC equal to the damage dealt. If it succeeds, she takes only half damage from the blow; otherwise, she takes full damage. She must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to use this ability&#151;if she is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC, she can&#146;t use this ability. At 19th level, she can use this ability twice per day. This ability replaces the maneuver training gained at 15th and 19th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Awesome Blow (Ex): </b>At 16th level, the brawler can as a standard action perform an awesome blow combat maneuver against a corporeal creature of her size or smaller. If the combat maneuver check succeeds, the opponent takes damage as if the brawler hit it with the close weapon she is wielding or an unarmed strike, it is knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of the brawler&#146;s choice, and it falls prone. The brawler can only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent can&#146;t move closer to the brawler than the square it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent&#146;s move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle. (Unlike the Awesome Blow monster feat, the brawler can be of any size to use this ability.)</p>
			<p><b>Improved Awesome Blow (Ex): </b>At 20th level, the brawler can use her awesome blow ability as an attack rather than as a standard action. She may use it on creatures of any size. If the maneuver roll is a natural 20, the brawler can immediately attempt to confirm the critical by rolling another combat maneuver check with all the same modifiers as the one just rolled; if the confirmation roll is successful, the attack deals double damage, and the damage from hitting an obstacle (if any) is also doubled.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Not content with perfecting her body with natural methods, a mutagenic mauler resorts to alchemy to unlock the primal beast within.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Deadly even with nothing in her hands, a brawler eschews using the fighter&#146;s heavy armor and the monk&#146;s mysticism, focusing instead on perfecting many styles of brutal unarmed combat. Versatile, agile, and able to adapt to most enemy attacks, a brawler&#146;s body is a powerful weapon.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Brawlers are maneuverable and well suited for creating flanking situations or dealing with lightly armored enemies, as well as quickly adapting to a rapidly changing battlefield.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Fighter and monk.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Brawler's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A brawler is proficient with all simple weapons plus the handaxe, short sword, and weapons from the close fighter weapon group. She is proficient with light armor and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Cunning (Ex): </b>If the brawler&#146;s Intelligence score is less than 13, it counts as 13 for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of combat feats.</p>
			<p><b>Martial Flexibility (Ex): </b>A brawler can take a move action to gain the benefit of a combat feat she doesn&#146;t possess. This effect lasts for 1 minute. The brawler must meet all the feat&#146;s prerequisites. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 her brawler level (minimum 1).</p>
			<p>The brawler can use this ability again before the duration expires in order to replace the previous combat feat with another choice.</p>
			<p>If a combat feat has a daily use limitation (such as Stunning Fist), any uses of that combat feat while using this ability count toward that feat&#146;s daily limit. At 6th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of two combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a swift action or two feats as a move action. She may use one of these feats to meet a prerequisite of the second feat; doing so means that she cannot replace a feat currently fulfilling another&#146;s prerequisite without also replacing those feats that require it. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of three combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a free action, two feats as a swift action, or three feats as a move action. She may use one of the feats to meet a prerequisite of the second and third feats, and use the second feat to meet a prerequisite of the third feat. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of one combat feat as an immediate action or three combat feats as a swift action. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p>At 20th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of any number of combat feats as a swift action. Each feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Martial Training (Ex) </b>At 1st level, a brawler counts her total brawler levels as both fighter levels and monk levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats. She also counts as both a fighter and a monk for feats and magic items that have different effects based on whether the character has levels in those classes (such as Stunning Fist and a monk&#146;s robe). This ability does not automatically grant feats normally granted to fighters and monks based on class level, namely Stunning Fist.</p>
			<p><b>Unarmed Strike: </b>At 1st level, a brawler gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A brawler may attack with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a brawler may make unarmed strikes with her hands full. A brawler applies her full Strength modifier (not half ) on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.</p>
			<p>Usually, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.</p>
			<p>A brawler&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that modify either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
			<p>A brawler also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than others, as shown on Table 1&#150;5: Brawler. The unarmed damage values listed on that table are for Medium brawlers. A Small brawler deals less damage than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large brawler deals more damage; see the following table.</p>

			<p><b>Bonus Combat Feats: </b>At 2nd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler gains a bonus combat feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be ones that affect or improve her defenses or melee attacks. The brawler must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus combat feat.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler can choose to learn a new bonus combat feat in place of a bonus combat feat she has already learned. In effect, the brawler loses the bonus combat feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A brawler can only change one feat at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time she gains a new bonus combat feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Flurry (Ex): </b>Starting at 2nd level, a brawler can make a brawler&#146;s flurry as a full-attack action. When doing so, a brawler has the Two-Weapon Fighting feat when attacking with any combination of unarmed strikes, weapons from the close fighter weapon group, or weapons with the &#147;monk&#148; special feature. She does not need to use two different weapons to use this ability.</p>
			<p>A brawler applies her full Strength modifier to her damage rolls for all attacks made with brawler&#146;s flurry, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand weapon or a weapon wielded in both hands. A brawler can substitute disarm, sunder, and trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of brawler&#146;s flurry. A brawler with natural weapons can&#146;t use such weapons as part of brawler&#146;s flurry, nor can she make natural weapon attacks in addition to her brawler&#146;s flurry attacks.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the brawler gains use of the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry. At 15th level, she gains use of the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry.</p>
			<p><i>Mutagen (Su): </i>At 1st level, a mutagenic mauler discovers how to create a mutagen that she can imbibe in order to heighten her physical prowess, though at the cost of her personality. This functions as an alchemist&#146;s mutagen and uses the brawler&#146;s class level as her alchemist level for this ability (alchemist levels stack with brawler levels for determining the effect of this ability). A mutagenic mauler counts as an alchemist for the purpose of imbibing a mutagen prepared by someone else.</p>
			<p>At 6th level, a mutagenic mauler gains a +2 bonus on damage rolls when she attacks in melee while in her mutagenic form. This bonus increases to +3 at 11th level, and to +4 at 16th level. At 10th level, a mutagenic mauler learns one of the following alchemist discoveries: feral mutagen or infuse mutagen, preserve organs, spontaneous healing. At 12th level, the mutagenic mauler learns the greater mutagen discovery.</p>
			<p><b>Beastmorph (Su): </b>Starting at 4th level, a mutagenic mauler gains additional abilities when using her mutagen. At 4th level, she gains low-light vision and a +10 enhancement bonus to her base speed. At 9th level, she gains darkvision to a range of 30 feet and a climb speed of 15 feet. At 13th level, the enhancement bonus to her base speed increases to +15 feet and she gains the scent ability within 30 feet. At 18th level, her climb speed increases to 30 feet, and the enhancement bonus to her base speed increases to +20 feet. This ability replaces AC bonus.</p>
			<p><b>Knockout (Ex): </b>At 4th level, once per day a brawler can unleash a devastating attack that can instantly knock a target unconscious. She must announce this intent before making her attack roll. If the brawler hits and the target takes damage from the blow, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the brawler&#146;s level + the higher of the brawler&#146;s Strength or Dexterity modifier) or fall unconscious for 1d6 rounds. Each round on its turn, the unconscious target may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect as a fullround action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Creatures immune to critical hits or nonlethal damage are immune to this ability. At 10th level, the brawler may use this ability twice per day; at 16th level, she may use it three times per day.</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Strike (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 9th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 12th level, she chooses one alignment component: chaotic, evil, good, or lawful; her unarmed strikes also count as this alignment for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. (This alignment component cannot be the opposite of the brawler&#146;s actual alignment, such as a good brawler choosing evil strikes.) At 17th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
			<p><b>Close Weapon Mastery (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a brawler&#146;s damage with close weapons increases. When wielding a close weapon, she uses the unarmed strike damage of a brawler 4 levels lower instead of the base damage for that weapon (for example, a 5th-level Medium brawler wielding a punching dagger deals 1d6 points of damage instead of the weapon&#146;s normal 1d4). If the weapon normally deals more damage than this, its damage is unchanged. This ability does not affect any other aspect of the weapon. The brawler can decide to use the weapon&#146;s base damage instead of her adjusted unarmed strike damage&#151;this must be declared before the attack roll is made.</p>
			<p><b>Awesome Blow (Ex): </b>At 16th level, the brawler can as a standard action perform an awesome blow combat maneuver against a corporeal creature of her size or smaller. If the combat maneuver check succeeds, the opponent takes damage as if the brawler hit it with the close weapon she is wielding or an unarmed strike, it is knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of the brawler&#146;s choice, and it falls prone. The brawler can only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent can&#146;t move closer to the brawler than the square it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent&#146;s move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle. (Unlike the Awesome Blow monster feat, the brawler can be of any size to use this ability.)</p>
			<p><b>Improved Awesome Blow (Ex): </b>At 20th level, the brawler can use her awesome blow ability as an attack rather than as a standard action. She may use it on creatures of any size. If the maneuver roll is a natural 20, the brawler can immediately attempt to confirm the critical by rolling another combat maneuver check with all the same modifiers as the one just rolled; if the confirmation roll is successful, the attack deals double damage, and the damage from hitting an obstacle (if any) is also doubled.</p>

In addition, if the living avalanche succeeds at a bull rush combat maneuver as part of a charge, she reduces the penalty combat maneuver checks to bull rush each creature beyond the first by 2.</p>
					<p>At 15th level, the living avalanche can attempt bull rush and overrun combat maneuvers against creatures two sizes larger than herself, but only as part of a charge.</p>
					<p>At 19th level, if the living avalanche succeeds at a bull rush combat maneuver as part of a charge, she reduces the penalty on combat maneuver checks to bull rush each creature beyond the first by an additional 2. When attempting an overrun combat maneuver as part of a charge, she also ignores any increase to a creature&#146;s CMD from having more than two legs.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Starting at 2nd level, a brawler can make a brawler&#146;s flurry as a full-attack action. When doing so, a brawler has the Two-Weapon Fighting feat when attacking with any combination of unarmed strikes, weapons from the close fighter weapon group, or weapons with the &#147;monk&#148; special feature. She does not need to use two different weapons to use this ability.</p>
					<p>A brawler applies her full Strength modifier to her damage rolls for all attacks made with brawler&#146;s flurry, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand weapon or a weapon wielded in both hands. A brawler can substitute disarm, sunder, and trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of brawler&#146;s flurry. A brawler with natural weapons can&#146;t use such weapons as part of brawler&#146;s flurry, nor can she make natural weapon attacks in addition to her brawler&#146;s flurry attacks.</p>
					<p>At 8th level, the brawler gains use of the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry. At 15th level, she gains use of the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry.</p>

This means that a brawler may make unarmed strikes with her hands full. A brawler applies her full Strength modifier (not half ) on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.</p>
					<p>Usually, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.</p>
					<p>A brawler&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that modify either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
					<p>A brawler also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than others, as shown on Table 1&#150;5: Brawler. The unarmed damage values listed on that table are for Medium brawlers.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>When a living avalanche is on the move, no one can stand in her way.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Deadly even with nothing in her hands, a brawler eschews using the fighter&#146;s heavy armor and the monk&#146;s mysticism, focusing instead on perfecting many styles of brutal unarmed combat. Versatile, agile, and able to adapt to most enemy attacks, a brawler&#146;s body is a powerful weapon.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Brawlers are maneuverable and well suited for creating flanking situations or dealing with lightly armored enemies, as well as quickly adapting to a rapidly changing battlefield.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Fighter and monk.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Brawler's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p>Skill Points at each Level: 4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p>Upon reaching 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler can choose to learn a new bonus combat feat in place of a bonus combat feat she has already learned. In effect, the brawler loses the bonus combat feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A brawler can only change one feat at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time she gains a new bonus combat feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Flurry (Ex): </b>Starting at 2nd level, a brawler can make a brawler&#146;s flurry as a full-attack action. When doing so, a brawler has the Two-Weapon Fighting feat when attacking with any combination of unarmed strikes, weapons from the close fighter weapon group, or weapons with the &#147;monk&#148; special feature. She does not need to use two different weapons to use this ability.</p>
			<p>A brawler applies her full Strength modifier to her damage rolls for all attacks made with brawler&#146;s flurry, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand weapon or a weapon wielded in both hands. A brawler can substitute disarm, sunder, and trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of brawler&#146;s flurry. A brawler with natural weapons can&#146;t use such weapons as part of brawler&#146;s flurry, nor can she make natural weapon attacks in addition to her brawler&#146;s flurry attacks.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the brawler gains use of the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry. At 15th level, she gains use of the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry.</p>
			<p><b>Earth Discipline (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a living avalanche gains Improved Overrun as a bonus feat, even if she doesn&#146;t meet the prerequisites. At 5th level, she gains Improved Bull Rush as a bonus feat, even if she doesn&#146;t meet the prerequisites.</p>
			<p><b>Landslide (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a living avalanche must choose overrun as her first combat maneuver for maneuver training. At 7th level, she must choose bull rush as her second combat maneuver for maneuver training. She doesn&#146;t gain training in any new combat maneuvers at later levels, but her bonuses on combat maneuver checks and to CMD for bull rush and overrun combat maneuvers increase as normal. She gains the following benefits at the listed levels.</p>
			<p>At 11th level, if she succeeds at an overrun combat maneuver as part of a charge, she automatically knocks her target prone (no matter the result of her check). In addition, if the living avalanche succeeds at a bull rush combat maneuver as part of a charge, she reduces the penalty combat maneuver checks to bull rush each creature beyond the first by 2.</p>
			<p>At 15th level, the living avalanche can attempt bull rush and overrun combat maneuvers against creatures two sizes larger than herself, but only as part of a charge.</p>
			<p>At 19th level, if the living avalanche succeeds at a bull rush combat maneuver as part of a charge, she reduces the penalty on combat maneuver checks to bull rush each creature beyond the first by an additional 2. When attempting an overrun combat maneuver as part of a charge, she also ignores any increase to a creature&#146;s CMD from having more than two legs.</p>
			<p><b>Unyielding (Ex): </b>At 4th level, when a living avalanche wears light armor or no armor, she gains DR 1/adamantine. This damage reduction increases by 1 at 9th, 13th, and 18th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Knockout (Ex): </b>At 4th level, once per day a brawler can unleash a devastating attack that can instantly knock a target unconscious. She must announce this intent before making her attack roll. If the brawler hits and the target takes damage from the blow, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the brawler&#146;s level + the higher of the brawler&#146;s Strength or Dexterity modifier) or fall unconscious for 1d6 rounds. Each round on its turn, the unconscious target may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect as a fullround action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Creatures immune to critical hits or nonlethal damage are immune to this ability. At 10th level, the brawler may use this ability twice per day; at 16th level, she may use it three times per day.</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Strike (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 9th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 12th level, she chooses one alignment component: chaotic, evil, good, or lawful; her unarmed strikes also count as this alignment for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. (This alignment component cannot be the opposite of the brawler&#146;s actual alignment, such as a good brawler choosing evil strikes.) At 17th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
			<p><b>Close Weapon Mastery (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a brawler&#146;s damage with close weapons increases. When wielding a close weapon, she uses the unarmed strike damage of a brawler 4 levels lower instead of the base damage for that weapon (for example, a 5th-level Medium brawler wielding a punching dagger deals 1d6 points of damage instead of the weapon&#146;s normal 1d4). If the weapon normally deals more damage than this, its damage is unchanged. This ability does not affect any other aspect of the weapon. The brawler can decide to use the weapon&#146;s base damage instead of her adjusted unarmed strike damage&#151;this must be declared before the attack roll is made.</p>
			<p><b>Avalanche (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a living avalanche can attempt to overrun multiple creatures as a full-round action. The living avalanche moves up to twice her speed in a straight line and attempts an overrun combat maneuver against each creature in her path, as long as that creature is no more than two size categories larger than herself. Each creature she succeeds against is knocked prone and takes damage as if the living avalanche hit it with a close weapon she is wielding or an unarmed strike. If she fails her combat maneuver check against a creature, she stops her movement in the space directly in front of the creature.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Avalanche (Ex): </b>At 20th level, if a living avalanche rolls a natural 20 on an overrun combat maneuver check as part of the avalanche ability, she can immediately attempt to confirm the critical hit by attempting another combat maneuver check with the same modifiers as the previous one; if the critical hit is confirmed, the attack deals double damage.</p>

If the maneuver roll is a natural 20, the brawler can immediately attempt to confirm the critical by rolling another combat maneuver check with all the same modifiers as the one just rolled; if the confirmation roll is successful, the attack deals double damage, and the damage from hitting an obstacle (if any) is also doubled.</p>

					<p>At 16th level, the brawler can as a standard action perform an awesome blow combat maneuver against a corporeal creature of her size or smaller. If the combat maneuver check succeeds, the opponent takes damage as if the brawler hit it with the close weapon she is wielding or an unarmed strike, it is knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of the brawler&#146;s choice, and it falls prone. The brawler can only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent can&#146;t move closer to the brawler than the square it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent&#146;s move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle. (Unlike the Awesome Blow monster feat, the brawler can be of any size to use this ability.)</p>

					<p>If a combat feat has a daily use limitation (such as Stunning Fist), any uses of that combat feat while using this ability count toward that feat&#146;s daily limit. At 6th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of two combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a swift action or two feats as a move action. She may use one of these feats to meet a prerequisite of the second feat; doing so means that she cannot replace a feat currently fulfilling another&#146;s prerequisite without also replacing those feats that require it. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>After Yamasa seceded from Lirgen, their elite combatants formed a military caste, called hinyasi, who protected Yamasa for centuries. Their martial traditions were centered on the use of farming tools and on other improvised weapons.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Deadly even with nothing in her hands, a brawler eschews using the fighter&#146;s heavy armor and the monk&#146;s mysticism, focusing instead on perfecting many styles of brutal unarmed combat. Versatile, agile, and able to adapt to most enemy attacks, a brawler&#146;s body is a powerful weapon.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Brawlers are maneuverable and well suited for creating flanking situations or dealing with lightly armored enemies, as well as quickly adapting to a rapidly changing battlefield.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Fighter and monk.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Brawler's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p>Skill Points at each Level: 4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A brawler is proficient with all simple weapons plus the handaxe, short sword, and weapons from the close fighter weapon group. She is proficient with light armor.</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Cunning (Ex): </b>If the brawler&#146;s Intelligence score is less than 13, it counts as 13 for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of combat feats.</p>
			<p><b>Humble Beginnings (Ex): </b>A hinyasi gains her choice of Catch Off-Guard or Throw Anything as a bonus feat. She is not proficient with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Martial Flexibility (Ex): </b>A brawler can take a move action to gain the benefit of a combat feat she doesn&#146;t possess. This effect lasts for 1 minute. The brawler must meet all the feat&#146;s prerequisites. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 her brawler level (minimum 1).</p>
			<p>The brawler can use this ability again before the duration expires in order to replace the previous combat feat with another choice.</p>
			<p>If a combat feat has a daily use limitation (such as Stunning Fist), any uses of that combat feat while using this ability count toward that feat&#146;s daily limit. At 6th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of two combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a swift action or two feats as a move action. She may use one of these feats to meet a prerequisite of the second feat; doing so means that she cannot replace a feat currently fulfilling another&#146;s prerequisite without also replacing those feats that require it. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of three combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a free action, two feats as a swift action, or three feats as a move action. She may use one of the feats to meet a prerequisite of the second and third feats, and use the second feat to meet a prerequisite of the third feat. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of one combat feat as an immediate action or three combat feats as a swift action. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p>At 20th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of any number of combat feats as a swift action. Each feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Martial Training (Ex) </b>At 1st level, a brawler counts her total brawler levels as both fighter levels and monk levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats. She also counts as both a fighter and a monk for feats and magic items that have different effects based on whether the character has levels in those classes (such as Stunning Fist and a monk&#146;s robe). This ability does not automatically grant feats normally granted to fighters and monks based on class level, namely Stunning Fist.</p>
			<p><b>Unarmed Strike: </b>At 1st level, a brawler gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A brawler may attack with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a brawler may make unarmed strikes with her hands full. A brawler applies her full Strength modifier (not half ) on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.</p>
			<p>Usually, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.</p>
			<p>A brawler&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that modify either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
			<p>A brawler also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than others, as shown on Table 1&#150;5: Brawler. The unarmed damage values listed on that table are for Medium brawlers. A Small brawler deals less damage than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large brawler deals more damage; see the following table.</p>

			<p><b>Bonus Combat Feats: </b>At 2nd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler gains a bonus combat feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be ones that affect or improve her defenses or melee attacks. The brawler must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus combat feat.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler can choose to learn a new bonus combat feat in place of a bonus combat feat she has already learned. In effect, the brawler loses the bonus combat feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A brawler can only change one feat at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time she gains a new bonus combat feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Flurry (Ex): </b>Starting at 2nd level, a brawler can make a brawler&#146;s flurry as a full-attack action. When doing so, a brawler has the Two-Weapon Fighting feat when attacking with any combination of unarmed strikes, weapons from the close fighter weapon group, or weapons with the &#147;monk&#148; special feature. She does not need to use two different weapons to use this ability.</p>
			<p>A brawler applies her full Strength modifier to her damage rolls for all attacks made with brawler&#146;s flurry, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand weapon or a weapon wielded in both hands. A brawler can substitute disarm, sunder, and trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of brawler&#146;s flurry. A brawler with natural weapons can&#146;t use such weapons as part of brawler&#146;s flurry, nor can she make natural weapon attacks in addition to her brawler&#146;s flurry attacks.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the brawler gains use of the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry. At 15th level, she gains use of the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry.</p>
			<p><b>Improvisation Training (Ex): </b>A hinyasi is skilled at fighting with improvised weapons. She deals damage equal to her unarmed strike damage while fighting with an improvised weapon. A hinyasi treats improvised weapons as weapons from the close fighter weapon group.</p>
			<p><b>Maneuver Training (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a brawler can select one combat maneuver to receive additional training. She gains a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks when performing that combat maneuver and a +1 bonus to her CMD when defending against that maneuver.</p>
			<p>At 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the brawler becomes further trained in another combat maneuver, gaining the above +1 bonus combat maneuver checks and to CMD. In addition, the bonuses granted by all previous maneuver training increase by 1 each. (For example, if a brawler chooses grapple at 3rd level and sunder at 7th level, her bonuses to grapple are +2 and bonuses to sunder are +1. If she then chooses bull rush upon reaching 11th level, her bonuses to grapple are +3, to sunder are +2, and to bull rush are +1.)</p>
			<p><b>AC Bonus (Ex): </b>At 4th level, when a brawler wears light or no armor, she gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC and CMD. This bonus increases by 1 at 9th, 13th, and 18th levels.</p>
			<p>These bonuses to AC apply against touch attacks. She loses these bonuses while immobilized or helpless, wearing medium or heavy armor, or carrying a medium or heavy load.</p>
			<p><b>Improvised Maneuver (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a hinyasi learns to confound and befuddle her opponents with improvised weapons. She chooses one of the following combat maneuvers: bull rush, drag, disarm, sunder, reposition, or trip. When she hits an opponent with an improvised weapon, the hinyasi can perform her chosen combat maneuver against the same target as a free action. She takes a &#150;4 penalty on the combat maneuver check, and she can&#146;t attempt an improvised maneuver check more than once per round. This combat maneuver still provokes attacks of opportunity unless the hinyasi has a feat or ability that allows her to perform it without provoking attacks of opportunity.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, she chooses a second combat maneuver that she can use with this ability, though she can still perform only one improvised maneuver per round. At 16th level, she chooses a third, though she can still perform only one improvised maneuver per round.</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Strike (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 9th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 12th level, she chooses one alignment component: chaotic, evil, good, or lawful; her unarmed strikes also count as this alignment for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. (This alignment component cannot be the opposite of the brawler&#146;s actual alignment, such as a good brawler choosing evil strikes.) At 17th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
			<p><b>Improvisation Mastery (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a hinyasi picks one type of improvised weapon (light, onehanded, or two-handed) and gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with that type of weapon.</p>
			<p><b>Close Weapon Mastery (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a brawler&#146;s damage with close weapons increases. When wielding a close weapon, she uses the unarmed strike damage of a brawler 4 levels lower instead of the base damage for that weapon (for example, a 5th-level Medium brawler wielding a punching dagger deals 1d6 points of damage instead of the weapon&#146;s normal 1d4). If the weapon normally deals more damage than this, its damage is unchanged. This ability does not affect any other aspect of the weapon. The brawler can decide to use the weapon&#146;s base damage instead of her adjusted unarmed strike damage&#151;this must be declared before the attack roll is made.</p>
			<p><b>Awesome Blow (Ex): </b>At 16th level, the brawler can as a standard action perform an awesome blow combat maneuver against a corporeal creature of her size or smaller. If the combat maneuver check succeeds, the opponent takes damage as if the brawler hit it with the close weapon she is wielding or an unarmed strike, it is knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of the brawler&#146;s choice, and it falls prone. The brawler can only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent can&#146;t move closer to the brawler than the square it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent&#146;s move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle. (Unlike the Awesome Blow monster feat, the brawler can be of any size to use this ability.)</p>
			<p><b>Improved Awesome Blow (Ex): </b>At 20th level, the brawler can use her awesome blow ability as an attack rather than as a standard action. She may use it on creatures of any size. If the maneuver roll is a natural 20, the brawler can immediately attempt to confirm the critical by rolling another combat maneuver check with all the same modifiers as the one just rolled; if the confirmation roll is successful, the attack deals double damage, and the damage from hitting an obstacle (if any) is also doubled.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Starting at 2nd level, a brawler can make a brawler&#146;s flurry as a full-attack action. When doing so, a brawler has the Two-Weapon Fighting feat when attacking with any combination of unarmed strikes, weapons from the close fighter weapon group, or weapons with the &#147;monk&#148; special feature. She does not need to use two different weapons to use this ability.</p>
					<p>A brawler applies her full Strength modifier to her damage rolls for all attacks made with brawler&#146;s flurry, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand weapon or a weapon wielded in both hands. A brawler can substitute disarm, sunder, and trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of brawler&#146;s flurry. A brawler with natural weapons can&#146;t use such weapons as part of brawler&#146;s flurry, nor can she make natural weapon attacks in addition to her brawler&#146;s flurry attacks.</p>
					<p>At 8th level, the brawler gains use of the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry. At 15th level, she gains use of the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a brawler gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A brawler may attack with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a brawler may make unarmed strikes with her hands full. A brawler applies her full Strength modifier (not half ) on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.</p>
					<p>Usually, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.</p>
					<p>A brawler&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that modify either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
					<p>A brawler also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than others, as shown on Table 1&#150;5: Brawler. The unarmed damage values listed on that table are for Medium brawlers. A Small brawler deals less damage than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large brawler deals more damage; see the following table.</p>

					<p>At 1st level, a brawler counts her total brawler levels as both fighter levels and monk levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats. She also counts as both a fighter and a monk for feats and magic items that have different effects based on whether the character has levels in those classes (such as Stunning Fist and a monk&#146;s robe). This ability does not automatically grant feats normally granted to fighters and monks based on class level, namely Stunning Fist.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A feral striker taps into a reservoir of druidic power hidden inside herself, allowing her to take animalistic characteristics.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Deadly even with nothing in her hands, a brawler eschews using the fighter&#146;s heavy armor and the monk&#146;s mysticism, focusing instead on perfecting many styles of brutal unarmed combat. Versatile, agile, and able to adapt to most enemy attacks, a brawler&#146;s body is a powerful weapon.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Brawlers are maneuverable and well suited for creating flanking situations or dealing with lightly armored enemies, as well as quickly adapting to a rapidly changing battlefield.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Fighter and monk.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Brawler's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>

Each aspect counts toward her total number of minutes (so if a feral striker who normally has 9 total minutes of aspects takes on two aspects simultaneously for 4 minutes, she still has 1 minute remaining). She can end one or both aspects as a free action on her turn.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, the feral shifter adds her Constitution modifier to the total number of minutes per day in which she can use feral aspect.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, the feral striker can take on three aspects simultaneously as a move action or one or two aspects as a swift action.</p>
			<p>At 20th level, the feral striker can take on as many aspects as she wishes at once as a swift action, and they count as only one aspect for the purpose of calculating duration.</p>
			<p><b>Martial Training (Ex) </b>At 1st level, a brawler counts her total brawler levels as both fighter levels and monk levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats. She also counts as both a fighter and a monk for feats and magic items that have different effects based on whether the character has levels in those classes (such as Stunning Fist and a monk&#146;s robe). This ability does not automatically grant feats normally granted to fighters and monks based on class level, namely Stunning Fist.</p>
			<p><b>Unarmed Strike: </b>At 1st level, a brawler gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A brawler may attack with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a brawler may make unarmed strikes with her hands full. A brawler applies her full Strength modifier (not half ) on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.</p>
			<p>Usually, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.</p>
			<p>A brawler&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that modify either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
			<p>A brawler also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than others, as shown on Table 1&#150;5: Brawler. The unarmed damage values listed on that table are for Medium brawlers. A Small brawler deals less damage than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large brawler deals more damage; see the following table.</p>

			<p><b>Bonus Combat Feats: </b>At 2nd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler gains a bonus combat feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be ones that affect or improve her defenses or melee attacks. The brawler must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus combat feat.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler can choose to learn a new bonus combat feat in place of a bonus combat feat she has already learned. In effect, the brawler loses the bonus combat feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A brawler can only change one feat at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time she gains a new bonus combat feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Flurry (Ex): </b>Starting at 2nd level, a brawler can make a brawler&#146;s flurry as a full-attack action. When doing so, a brawler has the Two-Weapon Fighting feat when attacking with any combination of unarmed strikes, weapons from the close fighter weapon group, or weapons with the &#147;monk&#148; special feature. She does not need to use two different weapons to use this ability.</p>
			<p>A brawler applies her full Strength modifier to her damage rolls for all attacks made with brawler&#146;s flurry, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand weapon or a weapon wielded in both hands. A brawler can substitute disarm, sunder, and trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of brawler&#146;s flurry. A brawler with natural weapons can&#146;t use such weapons as part of brawler&#146;s flurry, nor can she make natural weapon attacks in addition to her brawler&#146;s flurry attacks.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the brawler gains use of the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry. At 15th level, she gains use of the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry.</p>
			<p><b>Maneuver Training (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a brawler can select one combat maneuver to receive additional training. She gains a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks when performing that combat maneuver and a +1 bonus to her CMD when defending against that maneuver.</p>
			<p>At 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the brawler becomes further trained in another combat maneuver, gaining the above +1 bonus combat maneuver checks and to CMD. In addition, the bonuses granted by all previous maneuver training increase by 1 each. (For example, if a brawler chooses grapple at 3rd level and sunder at 7th level, her bonuses to grapple are +2 and bonuses to sunder are +1. If she then chooses bull rush upon reaching 11th level, her bonuses to grapple are +3, to sunder are +2, and to bull rush are +1.)</p>
			<p><b>AC Bonus (Ex): </b>At 4th level, when a brawler wears light or no armor, she gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC and CMD. This bonus increases by 1 at 9th, 13th, and 18th levels.</p>
			<p>These bonuses to AC apply against touch attacks. She loses these bonuses while immobilized or helpless, wearing medium or heavy armor, or carrying a medium or heavy load.</p>
			<p><b>Knockout (Ex): </b>At 4th level, once per day a brawler can unleash a devastating attack that can instantly knock a target unconscious. She must announce this intent before making her attack roll. If the brawler hits and the target takes damage from the blow, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the brawler&#146;s level + the higher of the brawler&#146;s Strength or Dexterity modifier) or fall unconscious for 1d6 rounds. Each round on its turn, the unconscious target may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect as a fullround action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Creatures immune to critical hits or nonlethal damage are immune to this ability. At 10th level, the brawler may use this ability twice per day; at 16th level, she may use it three times per day.</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Strike (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 9th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 12th level, she chooses one alignment component: chaotic, evil, good, or lawful; her unarmed strikes also count as this alignment for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. (This alignment component cannot be the opposite of the brawler&#146;s actual alignment, such as a good brawler choosing evil strikes.) At 17th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
			<p><b>Close Weapon Mastery (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a brawler&#146;s damage with close weapons increases. When wielding a close weapon, she uses the unarmed strike damage of a brawler 4 levels lower instead of the base damage for that weapon (for example, a 5th-level Medium brawler wielding a punching dagger deals 1d6 points of damage instead of the weapon&#146;s normal 1d4). If the weapon normally deals more damage than this, its damage is unchanged. This ability does not affect any other aspect of the weapon. The brawler can decide to use the weapon&#146;s base damage instead of her adjusted unarmed strike damage&#151;this must be declared before the attack roll is made.</p>
			<p><b>Awesome Blow (Ex): </b>At 16th level, the brawler can as a standard action perform an awesome blow combat maneuver against a corporeal creature of her size or smaller. If the combat maneuver check succeeds, the opponent takes damage as if the brawler hit it with the close weapon she is wielding or an unarmed strike, it is knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of the brawler&#146;s choice, and it falls prone. The brawler can only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent can&#146;t move closer to the brawler than the square it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent&#146;s move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle. (Unlike the Awesome Blow monster feat, the brawler can be of any size to use this ability.)</p>
			<p><b>Improved Awesome Blow (Ex): </b>At 20th level, the brawler can use her awesome blow ability as an attack rather than as a standard action. She may use it on creatures of any size. If the maneuver roll is a natural 20, the brawler can immediately attempt to confirm the critical by rolling another combat maneuver check with all the same modifiers as the one just rolled; if the confirmation roll is successful, the attack deals double damage, and the damage from hitting an obstacle (if any) is also doubled.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A versatile soldier who inspires her companions with her fighting prowess, an exemplar is at home on the front lines of battles anywhere.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Deadly even with nothing in her hands, a brawler eschews using the fighter&#146;s heavy armor and the monk&#146;s mysticism, focusing instead on perfecting many styles of brutal unarmed combat. Versatile, agile, and able to adapt to most enemy attacks, a brawler&#146;s body is a powerful weapon.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Brawlers are maneuverable and well suited for creating flanking situations or dealing with lightly armored enemies, as well as quickly adapting to a rapidly changing battlefield.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Fighter and monk.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Brawler's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p>Skill Points at each Level: 4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A brawler is proficient with all simple weapons plus the handaxe, short sword, and weapons from the close fighter weapon group. She is proficient with light armor and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Cunning (Ex): </b>If the brawler&#146;s Intelligence score is less than 13, it counts as 13 for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of combat feats.</p>
			<p><b>Martial Flexibility (Ex): </b>A brawler can take a move action to gain the benefit of a combat feat she doesn&#146;t possess. This effect lasts for 1 minute. The brawler must meet all the feat&#146;s prerequisites. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 her brawler level (minimum 1).</p>
			<p>The brawler can use this ability again before the duration expires in order to replace the previous combat feat with another choice.</p>
			<p>If a combat feat has a daily use limitation (such as Stunning Fist), any uses of that combat feat while using this ability count toward that feat&#146;s daily limit. At 6th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of two combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a swift action or two feats as a move action. She may use one of these feats to meet a prerequisite of the second feat; doing so means that she cannot replace a feat currently fulfilling another&#146;s prerequisite without also replacing those feats that require it. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of three combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a free action, two feats as a swift action, or three feats as a move action. She may use one of the feats to meet a prerequisite of the second and third feats, and use the second feat to meet a prerequisite of the third feat. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of one combat feat as an immediate action or three combat feats as a swift action. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p>At 20th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of any number of combat feats as a swift action. Each feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Martial Training (Ex) </b>At 1st level, a brawler counts her total brawler levels as both fighter levels and monk levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats. She also counts as both a fighter and a monk for feats and magic items that have different effects based on whether the character has levels in those classes (such as Stunning Fist and a monk&#146;s robe). This ability does not automatically grant feats normally granted to fighters and monks based on class level, namely Stunning Fist.</p>
			<p><b>Call to Arms (Ex): </b>At 1st level, an exemplar can expend a use of martial flexibility to rouse her allies into action. All allies within 30 feet are no longer flat-footed, even if they are surprised. Using this ability is a move action. At 6th level, the exemplar can use it as a swift action instead. At 10th level, she can use it as a free action. At 12th level, she can use it as an immediate action. This ability replaces unarmed strike and close weapon mastery.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Combat Feats: </b>At 2nd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler gains a bonus combat feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be ones that affect or improve her defenses or melee attacks. The brawler must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus combat feat.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler can choose to learn a new bonus combat feat in place of a bonus combat feat she has already learned. In effect, the brawler loses the bonus combat feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A brawler can only change one feat at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time she gains a new bonus combat feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Flurry (Ex): </b>Starting at 2nd level, a brawler can make a brawler&#146;s flurry as a full-attack action. When doing so, a brawler has the Two-Weapon Fighting feat when attacking with any combination of unarmed strikes, weapons from the close fighter weapon group, or weapons with the &#147;monk&#148; special feature. She does not need to use two different weapons to use this ability.</p>
			<p>A brawler applies her full Strength modifier to her damage rolls for all attacks made with brawler&#146;s flurry, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand weapon or a weapon wielded in both hands. A brawler can substitute disarm, sunder, and trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of brawler&#146;s flurry. A brawler with natural weapons can&#146;t use such weapons as part of brawler&#146;s flurry, nor can she make natural weapon attacks in addition to her brawler&#146;s flurry attacks.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the brawler gains use of the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry. At 15th level, she gains use of the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiring Prowess (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, an exemplar gains the ability to use certain bardic performances. She can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier; this increases by 1 round per brawler level thereafter. The exemplar&#146;s effective bard level for this ability is equal to her brawler level &#150; 2. At 3rd level, the exemplar can use inspire courage. At 11th level, the exemplar can use inspire greatness. At 15th level, the exemplar can use inspire heroics. Instead of the Perform skill, she activates this ability with impressive flourishes and displays of martial talent (this uses visual components). This ability otherwise functions as bardic performance; feats and other effects that affect bardic performance (such as the Extra Performance feat) apply to it. This ability replaces maneuver training and AC bonus.</p>
			<p><b>Knockout (Ex): </b>At 4th level, once per day a brawler can unleash a devastating attack that can instantly knock a target unconscious. She must announce this intent before making her attack roll. If the brawler hits and the target takes damage from the blow, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the brawler&#146;s level + the higher of the brawler&#146;s Strength or Dexterity modifier) or fall unconscious for 1d6 rounds. Each round on its turn, the unconscious target may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect as a fullround action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Creatures immune to critical hits or nonlethal damage are immune to this ability. At 10th level, the brawler may use this ability twice per day; at 16th level, she may use it three times per day.</p>
			<p><b>Field Instruction (Ex): </b>At 5th level, as a standard action an exemplar can grant a teamwork feat to all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear her. This teamwork feat must be one the exemplar knows or has gained with the martial flexibility ability. Allies retain the use of this teamwork feat for 3 rounds + 1 round for every 2 brawler levels. If the granted teamwork feat is one gained from martial flexibility, this duration ends immediately if the exemplar loses access to that feat. Allies don&#146;t need to meet the prerequisites of this teamwork feat. The exemplar can use this ability once per day at 5th level, plus one additional time per day at 9th, 12th, and 17th level. This ability otherwise counts as the cavalier&#146;s tactician class feature; feats and other effects which affect tactician (such as Practiced Tactician) apply to it. This ability replaces brawler&#146;s strike.</p>
			<p><b>Awesome Blow (Ex): </b>At 16th level, the brawler can as a standard action perform an awesome blow combat maneuver against a corporeal creature of her size or smaller. If the combat maneuver check succeeds, the opponent takes damage as if the brawler hit it with the close weapon she is wielding or an unarmed strike, it is knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of the brawler&#146;s choice, and it falls prone. The brawler can only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent can&#146;t move closer to the brawler than the square it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent&#146;s move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle. (Unlike the Awesome Blow monster feat, the brawler can be of any size to use this ability.)</p>
			<p><b>Improved Awesome Blow (Ex): </b>At 20th level, the brawler can use her awesome blow ability as an attack rather than as a standard action. She may use it on creatures of any size. If the maneuver roll is a natural 20, the brawler can immediately attempt to confirm the critical by rolling another combat maneuver check with all the same modifiers as the one just rolled; if the confirmation roll is successful, the attack deals double damage, and the damage from hitting an obstacle (if any) is also doubled.</p>

If the weapon normally deals more damage than this, its damage is unchanged. This ability does not affect any other aspect of the weapon. The brawler can decide to use the weapon&#146;s base damage instead of her adjusted unarmed strike damage&#151;this must be declared before the attack roll is made.</p>

At 12th level, she chooses one alignment component: chaotic, evil, good, or lawful; her unarmed strikes also count as this alignment for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. (This alignment component cannot be the opposite of the brawler&#146;s actual alignment, such as a good brawler choosing evil strikes.) At 17th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>

In addition, the bonuses granted by all previous maneuver training increase by 1 each. (For example, if a brawler chooses grapple at 3rd level and sunder at 7th level, her bonuses to grapple are +2 and bonuses to sunder are +1.

She does not need to use two different weapons to use this ability.</p>
					<p>A brawler applies her full Strength modifier to her damage rolls for all attacks made with brawler&#146;s flurry, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand weapon or a weapon wielded in both hands.

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a brawler gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A brawler may attack with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a brawler may make unarmed strikes with her hands full. A brawler applies her full Strength modifier (not half ) on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.</p>
					<p>Usually, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.</p>
					<p>A brawler&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that modify either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
					<p>A brawler also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than others, as shown on Table 1&#150;5: Brawler. The unarmed damage values listed on that table are for Medium brawlers. A Small brawler deals less damage than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large brawler deals more damage; see the following table.</p>

					<p>At 1st level, a brawler counts her total brawler levels as both fighter levels and monk levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats. She also counts as both a fighter and a monk for feats and magic items that have different effects based on whether the character has levels in those classes (such as Stunning Fist and a monk&#146;s robe). This ability does not automatically grant feats normally granted to fighters and monks based on class level, namely Stunning Fist.</p>

				<name type="string">Limb Modification</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A constructed pugilist chooses one of the following limb modifications at 1st level and another at 6th, 10th, 12th, and 20th levels. These modifications do not require the constructed pugilist to rebuild her constructed limb.</p>
					<p><i>Flex Limb: </i>The limb is divided into jointed segments held in place with rigid rods. As a standard action, the constructed pugilist can release the rods and turn her limb into a whiplike appendage. In this mode, the prosthesis can be used to make trip attempts, and it grants a +2 bonus on disarm attempts made using it. The constructed pugilist doesn&#146;t run the risk of dropping her limb if she fails. Returning the limb to its rigid form takes a standard action. As a standard action, a constructed pugilist with both flex limb and limb extender can activate or deactivate one of those limb modifications or both simultaneously; when the constructed pugilist has both flex limb and limb extender activated, she gains the benefits of reach with the flex limb abilities.</p>
					<p><i>Grapnel Arm: </i>The constructed pugilist can fire a grappling hook built into her prosthesis. The grappling hook is attached to a 40-foot-long fine chain affixed to the limb. The constructed pugilist can attack with the grappling hook as a standard action, making a ranged touch attack against the target. The grappling hook can&#146;t be used as part of a full attack. On a successful hit, the grappling hook deals no damage, but it functions as though it had the grapple weapon special feature (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 22), except it requires only a hit (not a critical hit) and the grapple ends if the constructed pugilist moves more than 40 feet away from the grappled creature. The constructed limb can&#146;t be used to make melee attacks until the grappling hook has been reloaded (a standard action).</p>
					<p><i>Limb Extender: </i>As a standard action, the constructed pugilist can activate an extender, giving her limb the reach weapon special feature. Returning the limb to its normal length is a standard action.</p>
					<p><i>Shielding Limb: </i>The constructed pugilist learns to block blows with her mechanical limb. She gains a +2 shield bonus to AC, though she loses this bonus anytime she loses her Dexterity bonus to AC.</p>
					<p><i>Tight Grip: </i>Special tensors allow the constructed pugilist to lock her grip in place. When using her constructed limb, the constructed pugilist gains a +1 bonus on Climb checks and combat maneuver checks to disarm and grapple, as well as to her CMD against attempts to disarm items held in the limb. This modification can be chosen only if the limb includes a hand or other gripping appendage.</p>
					<p><i>Vicious Blades: </i>Razor-sharp blades on the surface of the limb cause it to deal bludgeoning and slashing damage and increase its critical threat range to 19&#150;20. A constructed pugilist who has the vicious spikes limb modification can&#146;t select this modification.</p>
					<p><i>Vicious Spikes: </i>Long spikes protrude from the limb, causing it to deal bludgeoning and piercing damage and increasing its critical multiplier to &#215;3. A constructed pugilist who has the vicious blades limb modification can&#146;t select this modification.</p>

					<p>A constructed pugilist begins play with a special prosthetic limb built for fighting and typically made of iron, steel, stone, or wood, with the corresponding hardness and hit points (see Table 7-13).

A constructed limb can benefit from either its own enhancement bonus and special abilities or those granted by an amulet of mighty fists, but if it would benefit from both simultaneously, it benefits only from the source with the higher effective enhancement bonus (the limb benefits from its own abilities in the case of a tie).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Mutants whose mutations make using standard weapons or other gear difficult sometimes attach mechanical prostheses to their existing limbs. Many develop combat skills that use their prostheses so they always have a weapon at hand. Over time, these brawlers customize their mechanical limbs, adding additional weaponry and other mechanisms.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Deadly even with nothing in her hands, a brawler eschews using the fighter&#146;s heavy armor and the monk&#146;s mysticism, focusing instead on perfecting many styles of brutal unarmed combat. Versatile, agile, and able to adapt to most enemy attacks, a brawler&#146;s body is a powerful weapon.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Brawlers are maneuverable and well suited for creating flanking situations or dealing with lightly armored enemies, as well as quickly adapting to a rapidly changing battlefield.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Fighter and monk.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Brawler's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (weapons) (Int), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p>Skill Points at each Level: 4 + Int modifier.</p>

For the purpose of rebuilding the limb as a masterwork weapon, rebuilding the limb out of a special material, or adding certain magical special abilities to it, the limb counts as a one-handed melee weapon that costs 60 gp and weighs 6 pounds&#151;though it is specially fitted to the constructed pugilist and can&#146;t be resold or used by anyone else. A constructed limb can benefit from either its own enhancement bonus and special abilities or those granted by an amulet of mighty fists, but if it would benefit from both simultaneously, it benefits only from the source with the higher effective enhancement bonus (the limb benefits from its own abilities in the case of a tie).</p>
			<p><b>Limb Modification: </b>A constructed pugilist chooses one of the following limb modifications at 1st level and another at 6th, 10th, 12th, and 20th levels. These modifications do not require the constructed pugilist to rebuild her constructed limb.</p>
			<p><i>Flex Limb: </i>The limb is divided into jointed segments held in place with rigid rods. As a standard action, the constructed pugilist can release the rods and turn her limb into a whiplike appendage. In this mode, the prosthesis can be used to make trip attempts, and it grants a +2 bonus on disarm attempts made using it. The constructed pugilist doesn&#146;t run the risk of dropping her limb if she fails. Returning the limb to its rigid form takes a standard action. As a standard action, a constructed pugilist with both flex limb and limb extender can activate or deactivate one of those limb modifications or both simultaneously; when the constructed pugilist has both flex limb and limb extender activated, she gains the benefits of reach with the flex limb abilities.</p>
			<p><i>Grapnel Arm: </i>The constructed pugilist can fire a grappling hook built into her prosthesis. The grappling hook is attached to a 40-foot-long fine chain affixed to the limb. The constructed pugilist can attack with the grappling hook as a standard action, making a ranged touch attack against the target. The grappling hook can&#146;t be used as part of a full attack. On a successful hit, the grappling hook deals no damage, but it functions as though it had the grapple weapon special feature (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 22), except it requires only a hit (not a critical hit) and the grapple ends if the constructed pugilist moves more than 40 feet away from the grappled creature. The constructed limb can&#146;t be used to make melee attacks until the grappling hook has been reloaded (a standard action).</p>
			<p><i>Limb Extender: </i>As a standard action, the constructed pugilist can activate an extender, giving her limb the reach weapon special feature. Returning the limb to its normal length is a standard action.</p>
			<p><i>Shielding Limb: </i>The constructed pugilist learns to block blows with her mechanical limb. She gains a +2 shield bonus to AC, though she loses this bonus anytime she loses her Dexterity bonus to AC.</p>
			<p><i>Tight Grip: </i>Special tensors allow the constructed pugilist to lock her grip in place. When using her constructed limb, the constructed pugilist gains a +1 bonus on Climb checks and combat maneuver checks to disarm and grapple, as well as to her CMD against attempts to disarm items held in the limb. This modification can be chosen only if the limb includes a hand or other gripping appendage.</p>
			<p><i>Vicious Blades: </i>Razor-sharp blades on the surface of the limb cause it to deal bludgeoning and slashing damage and increase its critical threat range to 19&#150;20. A constructed pugilist who has the vicious spikes limb modification can&#146;t select this modification.</p>
			<p><i>Vicious Spikes: </i>Long spikes protrude from the limb, causing it to deal bludgeoning and piercing damage and increasing its critical multiplier to &#215;3. A constructed pugilist who has the vicious blades limb modification can&#146;t select this modification.</p>
			<p><b>Martial Training (Ex) </b>At 1st level, a brawler counts her total brawler levels as both fighter levels and monk levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats. She also counts as both a fighter and a monk for feats and magic items that have different effects based on whether the character has levels in those classes (such as Stunning Fist and a monk&#146;s robe). This ability does not automatically grant feats normally granted to fighters and monks based on class level, namely Stunning Fist.</p>
			<p><b>Unarmed Strike: </b>At 1st level, a brawler gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A brawler may attack with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a brawler may make unarmed strikes with her hands full. A brawler applies her full Strength modifier (not half ) on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.</p>
			<p>Usually, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.</p>
			<p>A brawler&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that modify either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
			<p>A brawler also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than others, as shown on Table 1&#150;5: Brawler. The unarmed damage values listed on that table are for Medium brawlers. A Small brawler deals less damage than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large brawler deals more damage; see the following table.</p>

			<p><b>Bonus Combat Feats: </b>At 2nd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler gains a bonus combat feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be ones that affect or improve her defenses or melee attacks. The brawler must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus combat feat.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler can choose to learn a new bonus combat feat in place of a bonus combat feat she has already learned. In effect, the brawler loses the bonus combat feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A brawler can only change one feat at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time she gains a new bonus combat feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Item Creation Feats: </b>At 2nd level, a constructed pugilist adds Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Master Craftsman (Craft [weapons]), and Skill Focus (Craft [weapons]) to the list of bonus feats she can choose (instead of just combat feats).</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Flurry (Ex): </b>Starting at 2nd level, a brawler can make a brawler&#146;s flurry as a full-attack action. When doing so, a brawler has the Two-Weapon Fighting feat when attacking with any combination of unarmed strikes, weapons from the close fighter weapon group, or weapons with the &#147;monk&#148; special feature. She does not need to use two different weapons to use this ability.</p>
			<p>A brawler applies her full Strength modifier to her damage rolls for all attacks made with brawler&#146;s flurry, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand weapon or a weapon wielded in both hands. A brawler can substitute disarm, sunder, and trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of brawler&#146;s flurry. A brawler with natural weapons can&#146;t use such weapons as part of brawler&#146;s flurry, nor can she make natural weapon attacks in addition to her brawler&#146;s flurry attacks.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the brawler gains use of the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry. At 15th level, she gains use of the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry.</p>
			<p><b>Maneuver Training (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a brawler can select one combat maneuver to receive additional training. She gains a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks when performing that combat maneuver and a +1 bonus to her CMD when defending against that maneuver.</p>
			<p>At 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the brawler becomes further trained in another combat maneuver, gaining the above +1 bonus combat maneuver checks and to CMD. In addition, the bonuses granted by all previous maneuver training increase by 1 each. (For example, if a brawler chooses grapple at 3rd level and sunder at 7th level, her bonuses to grapple are +2 and bonuses to sunder are +1. If she then chooses bull rush upon reaching 11th level, her bonuses to grapple are +3, to sunder are +2, and to bull rush are +1.)</p>
			<p><b>AC Bonus (Ex): </b>At 4th level, when a brawler wears light or no armor, she gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC and CMD. This bonus increases by 1 at 9th, 13th, and 18th levels.</p>
			<p>These bonuses to AC apply against touch attacks. She loses these bonuses while immobilized or helpless, wearing medium or heavy armor, or carrying a medium or heavy load.</p>
			<p><b>Knockout (Ex): </b>At 4th level, once per day a brawler can unleash a devastating attack that can instantly knock a target unconscious. She must announce this intent before making her attack roll. If the brawler hits and the target takes damage from the blow, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the brawler&#146;s level + the higher of the brawler&#146;s Strength or Dexterity modifier) or fall unconscious for 1d6 rounds. Each round on its turn, the unconscious target may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect as a fullround action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Creatures immune to critical hits or nonlethal damage are immune to this ability. At 10th level, the brawler may use this ability twice per day; at 16th level, she may use it three times per day.</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Strike (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 9th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 12th level, she chooses one alignment component: chaotic, evil, good, or lawful; her unarmed strikes also count as this alignment for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. (This alignment component cannot be the opposite of the brawler&#146;s actual alignment, such as a good brawler choosing evil strikes.) At 17th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
			<p><b>Close Weapon Mastery (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a brawler&#146;s damage with close weapons increases. When wielding a close weapon, she uses the unarmed strike damage of a brawler 4 levels lower instead of the base damage for that weapon (for example, a 5th-level Medium brawler wielding a punching dagger deals 1d6 points of damage instead of the weapon&#146;s normal 1d4). If the weapon normally deals more damage than this, its damage is unchanged. This ability does not affect any other aspect of the weapon. The brawler can decide to use the weapon&#146;s base damage instead of her adjusted unarmed strike damage&#151;this must be declared before the attack roll is made.</p>
			<p><b>Awesome Blow (Ex): </b>At 16th level, the brawler can as a standard action perform an awesome blow combat maneuver against a corporeal creature of her size or smaller. If the combat maneuver check succeeds, the opponent takes damage as if the brawler hit it with the close weapon she is wielding or an unarmed strike, it is knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of the brawler&#146;s choice, and it falls prone. The brawler can only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent can&#146;t move closer to the brawler than the square it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent&#146;s move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle. (Unlike the Awesome Blow monster feat, the brawler can be of any size to use this ability.)</p>
			<p><b>Improved Awesome Blow (Ex): </b>At 20th level, the brawler can use her awesome blow ability as an attack rather than as a standard action. She may use it on creatures of any size. If the maneuver roll is a natural 20, the brawler can immediately attempt to confirm the critical by rolling another combat maneuver check with all the same modifiers as the one just rolled; if the confirmation roll is successful, the attack deals double damage, and the damage from hitting an obstacle (if any) is also doubled.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some taverns employ bouncers to keep out undesirables or for when their customers get too rowdy.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Deadly even with nothing in her hands, a brawler eschews using the fighter&#146;s heavy armor and the monk&#146;s mysticism, focusing instead on perfecting many styles of brutal unarmed combat. Versatile, agile, and able to adapt to most enemy attacks, a brawler&#146;s body is a powerful weapon.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Brawlers are maneuverable and well suited for creating flanking situations or dealing with lightly armored enemies, as well as quickly adapting to a rapidly changing battlefield.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Fighter and monk.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Brawler's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p>Skill Points at each Level: 4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A brawler is proficient with all simple weapons plus the handaxe, short sword, and weapons from the close fighter weapon group. She is proficient with light armor and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Cunning (Ex): </b>If the brawler&#146;s Intelligence score is less than 13, it counts as 13 for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of combat feats.</p>
			<p><b>Martial Flexibility (Ex): </b>A brawler can take a move action to gain the benefit of a combat feat she doesn&#146;t possess. This effect lasts for 1 minute. The brawler must meet all the feat&#146;s prerequisites. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 her brawler level (minimum 1).</p>
			<p>The brawler can use this ability again before the duration expires in order to replace the previous combat feat with another choice.</p>
			<p>If a combat feat has a daily use limitation (such as Stunning Fist), any uses of that combat feat while using this ability count toward that feat&#146;s daily limit. At 6th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of two combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a swift action or two feats as a move action. She may use one of these feats to meet a prerequisite of the second feat; doing so means that she cannot replace a feat currently fulfilling another&#146;s prerequisite without also replacing those feats that require it. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of three combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a free action, two feats as a swift action, or three feats as a move action. She may use one of the feats to meet a prerequisite of the second and third feats, and use the second feat to meet a prerequisite of the third feat. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of one combat feat as an immediate action or three combat feats as a swift action. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p>At 20th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of any number of combat feats as a swift action. Each feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Martial Training (Ex) </b>At 1st level, a brawler counts her total brawler levels as both fighter levels and monk levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats. She also counts as both a fighter and a monk for feats and magic items that have different effects based on whether the character has levels in those classes (such as Stunning Fist and a monk&#146;s robe). This ability does not automatically grant feats normally granted to fighters and monks based on class level, namely Stunning Fist.</p>
			<p><b>Unarmed Strike: </b>At 1st level, a brawler gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A brawler may attack with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a brawler may make unarmed strikes with her hands full. A brawler applies her full Strength modifier (not half ) on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.</p>
			<p>Usually, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.</p>
			<p>A brawler&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that modify either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
			<p>A brawler also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than others, as shown on Table 1&#150;5: Brawler. The unarmed damage values listed on that table are for Medium brawlers. A Small brawler deals less damage than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large brawler deals more damage; see the following table.</p>

			<p><b>Bonus Combat Feats: </b>At 2nd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler gains a bonus combat feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be ones that affect or improve her defenses or melee attacks. The brawler must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus combat feat.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler can choose to learn a new bonus combat feat in place of a bonus combat feat she has already learned. In effect, the brawler loses the bonus combat feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A brawler can only change one feat at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time she gains a new bonus combat feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Flurry (Ex): </b>Starting at 2nd level, a brawler can make a brawler&#146;s flurry as a full-attack action. When doing so, a brawler has the Two-Weapon Fighting feat when attacking with any combination of unarmed strikes, weapons from the close fighter weapon group, or weapons with the &#147;monk&#148; special feature. She does not need to use two different weapons to use this ability.</p>
			<p>A brawler applies her full Strength modifier to her damage rolls for all attacks made with brawler&#146;s flurry, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand weapon or a weapon wielded in both hands. A brawler can substitute disarm, sunder, and trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of brawler&#146;s flurry. A brawler with natural weapons can&#146;t use such weapons as part of brawler&#146;s flurry, nor can she make natural weapon attacks in addition to her brawler&#146;s flurry attacks.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the brawler gains use of the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry. At 15th level, she gains use of the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry.</p>
			<p><b>Maneuver Training (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a brawler can select one combat maneuver to receive additional training. She gains a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks when performing that combat maneuver and a +1 bonus to her CMD when defending against that maneuver.</p>
			<p>At 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the brawler becomes further trained in another combat maneuver, gaining the above +1 bonus combat maneuver checks and to CMD. In addition, the bonuses granted by all previous maneuver training increase by 1 each. (For example, if a brawler chooses grapple at 3rd level and sunder at 7th level, her bonuses to grapple are +2 and bonuses to sunder are +1. If she then chooses bull rush upon reaching 11th level, her bonuses to grapple are +3, to sunder are +2, and to bull rush are +1.)</p>
			<p><b>AC Bonus (Ex): </b>At 4th level, when a brawler wears light or no armor, she gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC and CMD. This bonus increases by 1 at 9th, 13th, and 18th levels.</p>
			<p>These bonuses to AC apply against touch attacks. She loses these bonuses while immobilized or helpless, wearing medium or heavy armor, or carrying a medium or heavy load.</p>
			<p><b>Knockout (Ex): </b>At 4th level, once per day a brawler can unleash a devastating attack that can instantly knock a target unconscious. She must announce this intent before making her attack roll. If the brawler hits and the target takes damage from the blow, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the brawler&#146;s level + the higher of the brawler&#146;s Strength or Dexterity modifier) or fall unconscious for 1d6 rounds. Each round on its turn, the unconscious target may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect as a fullround action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Creatures immune to critical hits or nonlethal damage are immune to this ability. At 10th level, the brawler may use this ability twice per day; at 16th level, she may use it three times per day.</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Strike (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 9th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 12th level, she chooses one alignment component: chaotic, evil, good, or lawful; her unarmed strikes also count as this alignment for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. (This alignment component cannot be the opposite of the brawler&#146;s actual alignment, such as a good brawler choosing evil strikes.) At 17th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
			<p><b>Close Weapon Mastery (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a brawler&#146;s damage with close weapons increases. When wielding a close weapon, she uses the unarmed strike damage of a brawler 4 levels lower instead of the base damage for that weapon (for example, a 5th-level Medium brawler wielding a punching dagger deals 1d6 points of damage instead of the weapon&#146;s normal 1d4). If the weapon normally deals more damage than this, its damage is unchanged. This ability does not affect any other aspect of the weapon.

			<p><b>Awesome Blow (Ex): </b>At 16th level, the brawler can as a standard action perform an awesome blow combat maneuver against a corporeal creature of her size or smaller. If the combat maneuver check succeeds, the opponent takes damage as if the brawler hit it with the close weapon she is wielding or an unarmed strike, it is knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of the brawler&#146;s choice, and it falls prone. The brawler can only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent can&#146;t move closer to the brawler than the square it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent&#146;s move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle. (Unlike the Awesome Blow monster feat, the brawler can be of any size to use this ability.)</p>
			<p><b>Improved Awesome Blow (Ex): </b>At 20th level, the brawler can use her awesome blow ability as an attack rather than as a standard action. She may use it on creatures of any size. If the maneuver roll is a natural 20, the brawler can immediately attempt to confirm the critical by rolling another combat maneuver check with all the same modifiers as the one just rolled; if the confirmation roll is successful, the attack deals double damage, and the damage from hitting an obstacle (if any) is also doubled.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Originating among the Mwangi tribes of Sargava, battle dancers practice a martial art that emphasizes constant motion, hiding their training from colonial oppressors by presenting it as an acrobatic dance. Sargava&#146;s alliance with the Shackles has led to a proliferation of the art there, and battle dancers are often found among Mwangi-descended pirates.</i></p>

			<p>Deadly even with nothing in her hands, a brawler eschews using the fighter&#146;s heavy armor and the monk&#146;s mysticism, focusing instead on perfecting many styles of brutal unarmed combat. Versatile, agile, and able to adapt to most enemy attacks, a brawler&#146;s body is a powerful weapon.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Brawlers are maneuverable and well suited for creating flanking situations or dealing with lightly armored enemies, as well as quickly adapting to a rapidly changing battlefield.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Fighter and monk.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Brawler's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (all) (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p>Skill Points at each Level: 4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A brawler is proficient with all simple weapons plus the handaxe, short sword, and weapons from the close fighter weapon group. She is proficient with light armor.</p>
			<p><b>Dancer&#146;s Cunning (Ex): </b>A battle dancer can treat her Charisma score as her Intelligence score for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of combat feats. In addition, she can attempt a Perform (dance) check instead of a Bluff check to feint in combat, and her unarmed strikes are considered to have the performance weapon special quality.</p>
			<p><b>Martial Flexibility (Ex): </b>A brawler can take a move action to gain the benefit of a combat feat she doesn&#146;t possess. This effect lasts for 1 minute. The brawler must meet all the feat&#146;s prerequisites. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 her brawler level (minimum 1).</p>
			<p>The brawler can use this ability again before the duration expires in order to replace the previous combat feat with another choice.</p>
			<p>If a combat feat has a daily use limitation (such as Stunning Fist), any uses of that combat feat while using this ability count toward that feat&#146;s daily limit. At 6th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of two combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a swift action or two feats as a move action. She may use one of these feats to meet a prerequisite of the second feat; doing so means that she cannot replace a feat currently fulfilling another&#146;s prerequisite without also replacing those feats that require it. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of three combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a free action, two feats as a swift action, or three feats as a move action. She may use one of the feats to meet a prerequisite of the second and third feats, and use the second feat to meet a prerequisite of the third feat. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p>At 12th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of one combat feat as an immediate action or three combat feats as a swift action. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p>At 20th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of any number of combat feats as a swift action. Each feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Martial Training (Ex) </b>At 1st level, a brawler counts her total brawler levels as both fighter levels and monk levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats. She also counts as both a fighter and a monk for feats and magic items that have different effects based on whether the character has levels in those classes (such as Stunning Fist and a monk&#146;s robe). This ability does not automatically grant feats normally granted to fighters and monks based on class level, namely Stunning Fist.</p>
			<p><b>Unarmed Strike: </b>At 1st level, a brawler gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A brawler may attack with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a brawler may make unarmed strikes with her hands full. A brawler applies her full Strength modifier (not half ) on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.</p>
			<p>Usually, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.</p>
			<p>A brawler&#146;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that modify either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p>
			<p>A brawler also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than others, as shown on Table 1&#150;5: Brawler. The unarmed damage values listed on that table are for Medium brawlers. A Small brawler deals less damage than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large brawler deals more damage; see the following table.</p>

			<p><b>Bonus Combat Feats: </b>At 2nd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler gains a bonus combat feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be ones that affect or improve her defenses or melee attacks. The brawler must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus combat feat.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler can choose to learn a new bonus combat feat in place of a bonus combat feat she has already learned. In effect, the brawler loses the bonus combat feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A brawler can only change one feat at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time she gains a new bonus combat feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Flurry (Ex): </b>Starting at 2nd level, a brawler can make a brawler&#146;s flurry as a full-attack action. When doing so, a brawler has the Two-Weapon Fighting feat when attacking with any combination of unarmed strikes, weapons from the close fighter weapon group, or weapons with the &#147;monk&#148; special feature. She does not need to use two different weapons to use this ability.</p>
			<p>A brawler applies her full Strength modifier to her damage rolls for all attacks made with brawler&#146;s flurry, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand weapon or a weapon wielded in both hands. A brawler can substitute disarm, sunder, and trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of brawler&#146;s flurry. A brawler with natural weapons can&#146;t use such weapons as part of brawler&#146;s flurry, nor can she make natural weapon attacks in addition to her brawler&#146;s flurry attacks.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the brawler gains use of the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry. At 15th level, she gains use of the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler&#146;s flurry.</p>
			<p><b>Rolling Flurry (Ex): </b>When a battle dancer uses her brawler&#146;s flurry, she must move 5 feet before each melee attack or combat maneuver. If she is unable to move 5 feet, she can&#146;t attempt any further attacks or combat maneuvers. She can&#146;t exceed her maximum speed. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity if the brawler would be able to take a 5-foot step normally; if she would be unable to (for instance, if she were in difficult terrain), the movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal unless she succeeds at the appropriate Acrobatics checks. While using this ability, she can still take her normal 5-foot step before or after making her attacks.</p>
			<p><b>Maneuver Training (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a brawler can select one combat maneuver to receive additional training. She gains a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks when performing that combat maneuver and a +1 bonus to her CMD when defending against that maneuver.</p>
			<p>At 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the brawler becomes further trained in another combat maneuver, gaining the above +1 bonus combat maneuver checks and to CMD. In addition, the bonuses granted by all previous maneuver training increase by 1 each. (For example, if a brawler chooses grapple at 3rd level and sunder at 7th level, her bonuses to grapple are +2 and bonuses to sunder are +1. If she then chooses bull rush upon reaching 11th level, her bonuses to grapple are +3, to sunder are +2, and to bull rush are +1.)</p>
			<p><b>Dancing Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, when an opponent attempts a melee attack against a battle dancer, the battle dancer can expend one use of an attack of opportunity as an immediate action to move 5 feet, granting the battle dancer a dodge bonus to AC equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 0) against the triggering attack. The attack is still resolved normally, even if the battle dancer&#146;s movement takes her out of the triggering attack&#146;s reach. This movement is not a 5-foot step and provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures other than the one that triggered this ability, though the battle dancer can attempt an Acrobatics check to avoid provoking the attacks. A battle dancer can use this ability a number of times per day equal to half her level. She can use this ability only while wearing light armor or no armor, and while carrying no heavier than a light load.</p>
			<p><b>Sparring Partners (Ex): </b>At 4th level, once per day when a battle dancer gains a flanking bonus on an attack while using her rolling flurry ability, the ally providing the flank gains a flanking bonus on its next attack against that opponent, even if the battle dancer moves out of a flanking position. If either the opponent or the ally moves more than 5 feet before the ally&#146;s attack, the flanking bonus is lost. This ability works only if the ally is on the opposite side of an opponent during the battle dancer&#146;s attack, not if a flanking bonus is gained in some other way, such as through Gang Up. A battle dancer can use this ability one additional time per day at 10th level and at 16th level.</p>
			<p><b>Brawler&#146;s Strike (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a brawler&#146;s unarmed strikes are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 9th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 12th level, she chooses one alignment component: chaotic, evil, good, or lawful; her unarmed strikes also count as this alignment for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. (This alignment component cannot be the opposite of the brawler&#146;s actual alignment, such as a good brawler choosing evil strikes.) At 17th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>
			<p><b>Close Weapon Mastery (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a brawler&#146;s damage with close weapons increases. When wielding a close weapon, she uses the unarmed strike damage of a brawler 4 levels lower instead of the base damage for that weapon (for example, a 5th-level Medium brawler wielding a punching dagger deals 1d6 points of damage instead of the weapon&#146;s normal 1d4). If the weapon normally deals more damage than this, its damage is unchanged. This ability does not affect any other aspect of the weapon. The brawler can decide to use the weapon&#146;s base damage instead of her adjusted unarmed strike damage&#151;this must be declared before the attack roll is made.</p>
			<p><b>Awesome Blow (Ex): </b>At 16th level, the brawler can as a standard action perform an awesome blow combat maneuver against a corporeal creature of her size or smaller. If the combat maneuver check succeeds, the opponent takes damage as if the brawler hit it with the close weapon she is wielding or an unarmed strike, it is knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of the brawler&#146;s choice, and it falls prone. The brawler can only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent can&#146;t move closer to the brawler than the square it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent&#146;s move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle. (Unlike the Awesome Blow monster feat, the brawler can be of any size to use this ability.)</p>
			<p><b>Improved Awesome Blow (Ex): </b>At 20th level, the brawler can use her awesome blow ability as an attack rather than as a standard action. She may use it on creatures of any size. If the maneuver roll is a natural 20, the brawler can immediately attempt to confirm the critical by rolling another combat maneuver check with all the same modifiers as the one just rolled; if the confirmation roll is successful, the attack deals double damage, and the damage from hitting an obstacle (if any) is also doubled.</p>
