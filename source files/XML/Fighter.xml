					<p>At 1st level, a steelbound fighter selects one type of weapon (such as shortswords, longbows, or heavy flails). He gains Weapon Focus with that specific weapon. Whenever he isn&#146;t wielding or carrying at least one weapon of this type (the weapon can be broken but not destroyed), a steelbound fighter takes a &#150;2 penalty to his Wisdom score and can&#146;t benefit from his fighter class abilities (excluding bonus feats gained from fighter levels). Once the steelbound fighter&#146;s weapon awakens (see steelbound awakening below), these penalties apply whenever the fighter isn&#146;t carrying or wielding that particular weapon.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 5th level, one nonintelligent weapon carried by the steelbound fighter becomes possessed by the latent spiritual energies that cling to his soul, transforming that weapon into an intelligent weapon. The weapon must be of the type the fighter chose at 1st level as his steelbound weapon. The steelbound weapon grants its wielder Alertness as a bonus feat as long as the weapon is wielded. A steelbound fighter gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls with his steelbound weapon. This bonus increases to +2 at 9th level, +3 at 13th level, +4 at 17th level, and +5 at 20th level.</p>
					<p>A steelbound weapon gains Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores of 10 when it awakens, and has the same alignment as its wielder. It communicates via empathy, and has senses that extend 30 feet. It has 5 ranks in a skill of the steelbound fighter&#146;s choice.</p>
					<p>At 9th level, the steelbound weapon&#146;s ability scores increase to 12 and it gains the ability to speak in its wielder&#146;s native tongue. The weapon gains the ability to cast a 3rd-level spell once per day (the choice of the spell is made by the steelbound fighter, but is subject to GM approval, and once chosen, it can&#146;t be changed), with a caster level equal to the steelbound fighter&#146;s level. The spell&#146;s save DC is based off of the item&#146;s Charisma.</p>
					<p>At 13th level, the steelbound weapon&#146;s ability scores increase to 14 and its senses extend to 120 feet. The weapon gains a special purpose of the steelbound fighter&#146;s choice (subject to GM approval).</p>
					<p>At 17th level, the steelbound weapon&#146;s ability scores increase to 16 and it gains telepathy as well as darkvision with a range of 60 feet. The weapon can now use its spelllike ability three times a day, and can select a second 3rdlevel spell that it can use once per day.</p>
					<p>A steelbound fighter transfers the effects of his steelbound awakening to a new weapon of the proper type automatically after carrying that weapon on his person for 24 hours, but can have only one weapon under the effects of steelbound awakening at any given time.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Whenever a particularly imposing intelligent weapon controls the mind of its wielder for long enough, spiritual echoes of this dominance can have strange resonances throughout that wielder&#146;s bloodline for generations to come. The steelbound fighter is sometimes the result of such a legacy: a fighter who has impressive martial resolve and technique with a specific weapon as the result of a powerful relationship a similar weapon had with one of his ancestors.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (including tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Steelbound Weapon (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a steelbound fighter selects one type of weapon (such as shortswords, longbows, or heavy flails). He gains Weapon Focus with that specific weapon. Whenever he isn&#146;t wielding or carrying at least one weapon of this type (the weapon can be broken but not destroyed), a steelbound fighter takes a &#150;2 penalty to his Wisdom score and can&#146;t benefit from his fighter class abilities (excluding bonus feats gained from fighter levels). Once the steelbound fighter&#146;s weapon awakens (see steelbound awakening below), these penalties apply whenever the fighter isn&#146;t carrying or wielding that particular weapon.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 2nd level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Bravery (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a fighter gains a +1 bonus on Will saves against fear. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum -4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed.</p>
			<p>In addition, a fighter can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 7th level, a fighter can move at his normal speed while wearing heavy armor.</p>
			<p><b>Steelbound Awakening (Su) : </b>At 5th level, one nonintelligent weapon carried by the steelbound fighter becomes possessed by the latent spiritual energies that cling to his soul, transforming that weapon into an intelligent weapon. The weapon must be of the type the fighter chose at 1st level as his steelbound weapon. The steelbound weapon grants its wielder Alertness as a bonus feat as long as the weapon is wielded. A steelbound fighter gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls with his steelbound weapon. This bonus increases to +2 at 9th level, +3 at 13th level, +4 at 17th level, and +5 at 20th level.</p>
			<p>A steelbound weapon gains Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores of 10 when it awakens, and has the same alignment as its wielder. It communicates via empathy, and has senses that extend 30 feet. It has 5 ranks in a skill of the steelbound fighter&#146;s choice.</p>
			<p>At 9th level, the steelbound weapon&#146;s ability scores increase to 12 and it gains the ability to speak in its wielder&#146;s native tongue. The weapon gains the ability to cast a 3rd-level spell once per day (the choice of the spell is made by the steelbound fighter, but is subject to GM approval, and once chosen, it can&#146;t be changed), with a caster level equal to the steelbound fighter&#146;s level. The spell&#146;s save DC is based off of the item&#146;s Charisma.</p>
			<p>At 13th level, the steelbound weapon&#146;s ability scores increase to 14 and its senses extend to 120 feet. The weapon gains a special purpose of the steelbound fighter&#146;s choice (subject to GM approval).</p>
			<p>At 17th level, the steelbound weapon&#146;s ability scores increase to 16 and it gains telepathy as well as darkvision with a range of 60 feet. The weapon can now use its spelllike ability three times a day, and can select a second 3rdlevel spell that it can use once per day.</p>
			<p>A steelbound fighter transfers the effects of his steelbound awakening to a new weapon of the proper type automatically after carrying that weapon on his person for 24 hours, but can have only one weapon under the effects of steelbound awakening at any given time.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 19th level, a fighter gains DR 5/- whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (&#215;2 becomes &#215;3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>-</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (including tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Bravery (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a fighter gains a +1 bonus on Will saves against fear. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum -4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed.</p>
			<p>In addition, a fighter can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 7th level, a fighter can move at his normal speed while wearing heavy armor.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 5th level, a fighter can select one group of weapons, as noted below. Whenever he attacks with a weapon from this group, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls.</p>
			<p>Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), a fighter becomes further trained in another group of weapons. He gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when using a weapon from this group. In addition, the bonuses granted by previous weapon groups increase by +1 each. For example, when a fighter reaches 9th level, he receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with one weapon group and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the weapon group selected at 5th level. Bonuses granted from overlapping groups do not stack. Take the highest bonus granted for a weapon if it resides in two or more groups.</p>
			<p>A fighter also adds this bonus to any combat maneuver checks made with weapons from this group. This bonus also applies to the fighter's Combat Maneuver Defense when defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against weapons from this group.</p>
			<p>Weapon groups are defined as follows (GMs may add other weapons to these groups, or add entirely new groups) -</p>
			<p><b>Armor Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 19th level, a fighter gains DR 5/- whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (&#215;2 becomes &#215;3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.</p>

Bonuses granted from overlapping groups do not stack. Take the highest bonus granted for a weapon if it resides in two or more groups.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The spear is one of the oldest weapons known to most humanoid races, and no weapon has seen as much use across the different continents of Golarion. One of the oldest spear-fighting styles originates in Vudra, where many martial arts traditions consider the spear to be the ultimate weapon.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A spear fighter is not proficient with heavy armor or tower shields. Instead, he gains Dodge as a bonus feat, even if he doesn&#146;t fulfill the prerequisites, but he can&#146;t use this feat while wearing heavy armor or using a shield.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Balanced Stride (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, the spear fighter gains a +1 bonus on Acrobatics checks to avoid attacks of opportunity. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels he has beyond 2nd.</p>
			<p><b>Spear Parry (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a spear fighter learns to parry his opponents&#146; attacks with his spear. This functions as a swashbuckler&#146;s opportune parry and riposte deed except as noted below. The spear fighter must use a weapon from the spears weapon group to perform the parry. He doesn&#146;t need panache to parry an attack or to make an attack against a creature whose attack he has parried; instead, he takes a cumulative &#150;4 penalty on all attacks (including further parry attempts) until the end of his next turn. At 7th, 11th, and 15th levels, the penalty decreases by 1. At 19th level, a spear fighter can use spear parry without penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 5th level, a spear fighter must choose the spears weapon group for the weapon training class feature. Whenever he attacks with a weapon from this group, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls.</p>
			<p>Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), a fighter becomes further trained in another group of weapons. He gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when using a weapon from this group. In addition, the bonuses granted by previous weapon groups increase by +1 each. For example, when a fighter reaches 9th level, he receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with one weapon group and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the weapon group selected at 5th level. Bonuses granted from overlapping groups do not stack. Take the highest bonus granted for a weapon if it resides in two or more groups.</p>
			<p>A fighter also adds this bonus to any combat maneuver checks made with weapons from this group. This bonus also applies to the fighter's Combat Maneuver Defense when defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against weapons from this group.</p>
			<p>Weapon groups are defined as follows (GMs may add other weapons to these groups, or add entirely new groups):</p>
			<p><b>Armor Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 19th level, a fighter gains DR 5/- whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a spear fighter must choose a weapon from the spears weapon group for his weapon mastery class feature. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (&#215;2 becomes &#215;3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Devoted to the perfection of a single weapon, the weapon master&#146;s meditations upon his favored weapon border on the obsessive, but none can deny his consummate skill. The weapon master must select a single type of weapon (such as longsword or shortbow). All of his abilities apply to that weapon type.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (including tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Guard (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a weapon master gains a +1 bonus to CMD against disarm and sunder attempts while wielding his chosen weapon. This bonus also applies on saves against any effect that targets his chosen weapon (for example, grease, heat metal, shatter, warp wood). The bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd. This ability replaces bravery.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Training (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, a weapon master gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with his chosen weapon. The bonus improves by +1 for every four levels beyond 3rd. This ability replaces armor training 1, 2, 3, and 4.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>With myriad weapons, armor, and useful gear always on hand, the weapon bearer squire ensures her knight is equipped for any task.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (including tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Rack (Ex): </b>At 1st level, once per round, a knight can retrieve an item carried by his weapon bearer squire as a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. In addition, a weapon bearer squire can pick up items dropped by her knight as an immediate action without provoking attacks of opportunity. The knight and the weapon bearer squire must be adjacent to each other and must both be able to move and communicate to use these abilities. This ability replaces the 1st-level fighter bonus combat feat.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Sharpening (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a weapon bearer squire can quickly hone her lord&#146;s weapons to make them more effective in combat. As a fullround action, a weapon bearer squire can use a whetstone to sharpen a weapon she is holding, granting whoever wields the weapon a +1 circumstance bonus on his next attack roll with that weapon. In addition, she can apply a weapon blanch (see Ultimate Equipment) to a weapon she is holding as a standard action, instead of a full-round action. This ability replaces the 2nd-level fighter bonus combat feat.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Repairs (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a weapon bearer squire can ensure her liege never goes unarmed, even if his weapon has all but shattered. As a full-round action, a weapon bearer squire can make rapid repairs to a weapon she is holding and is proficient with by succeeding at a DC 20 Craft (weapons) check. The item does not regain any hit points, but loses the broken condition for a number of rounds equal to the weapon bearer squire&#146;s class level. This ability replaces armor training 1.</p>
			<p><b>Bravery (Ex) : </b>Starting at 2nd level, a fighter gains a +1 bonus on Will saves against fear. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 5th level, a fighter can select one group of weapons, as noted below. Whenever he attacks with a weapon from this group, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls.</p>
			<p>Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), a fighter becomes further trained in another group of weapons. He gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when using a weapon from this group. In addition, the bonuses granted by previous weapon groups increase by +1 each. For example, when a fighter reaches 9th level, he receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with one weapon group and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the weapon group selected at 5th level. Bonuses granted from overlapping groups do not stack. Take the highest bonus granted for a weapon if it resides in two or more groups.</p>
			<p>A fighter also adds this bonus to any combat maneuver checks made with weapons from this group. This bonus also applies to the fighter's Combat Maneuver Defense when defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against weapons from this group.</p>
			<p>Weapon groups are defined as follows (GMs may add other weapons to these groups, or add entirely new groups).</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat: </b>At 4th level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Training (Ex): </b>Starting at 7th level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum -4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed.In addition, a fighter can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 7th level, a fighter can move at his normal speed while wearing heavy armor.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 19th level, a fighter gains DR 5/- whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (&#215;2 becomes &#215;3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Honorable, fearless experts in gun and blade, warlords roam the dried seabeds of time-worn Mars, warring in great tribes for supremacy over a dying planet. Capable of relentless brutality and quick to ?are into open hostilities, warlords cloak their violent ways with paens to great noble houses or honored ancient traditions, bringing an air of respectability and etiquette to the butchery of brazen blades against bare skin. Warlords eschew armor as impractical to their harsh and often desert-like environment, preferring the free movement of near- nakedness. Warlords tend to specialize in the traditional weapons of Barsoom, leaving them ignorant of even simple Weapons common on other worlds. The same impulse that guides a warlord to stick to the traditional garb and gear of his culture can lead to a single-mindedness of purpose that can propel him far within his tribe or noble house. Even warlords of low status in Martian society claim a connection&#151; no matter how ancient&#151;with some great chieftain or emperor, seeing in the glorious past a path to a more hopeful future. Barsoom confers noble status upon its warlords through ritual combat in the case of green Martians or on merit and upon great achievement or heroics in the case of red Martians, so climbing the ladder ofstatus is an important part of a warlord&#146;s journey through life.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Vikings seek to raid &#147;softer societies&#148; and return with their longships filled with plunder. A viking strikes fear into the heart of her foes, and in battle she can fly into a terrible rage. Many vikings wear the pelts of bears or wolves, drawing on the strength and ferocity of these beasts in battle. Vikings do not wear heavy armor, but they are skilled at fighting with an axe or spear in conjunction with a shield.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

					<p>At 2nd level, and at every even level thereafter (execpt 6th and 12th), a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level).

					<p>At 12th level, upon making a successful attack with a slashing or piercing weapon, the venomblade can spend a use of the ability granted by the Spit Venom feat as a swift action to spray his toxin into the wound.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The venomblade has learned to take full advantage of his toxic spittle, blinding his targets and then rushing in to cut them down where they stand. The venomblade is an archetype of the fighter class that is available to nagaji characters.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Race: </b>Nagaji Only</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (including tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Venom Projection (Ex): </b>The venomblade must take the Spit Venom nagaji racial feat as his 1st-level fighter bonus feat if he does not already have that ability. At 2nd level, he does not provoke an attack of opportunity for using the ability granted by the Spit Venom feat. At 4th level, he can use the ability granted by the Spit Venom feat as a standard action; at 8th level, he can use it as a move action; and at 12th level, he can use it as a swift action.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 2nd level, and at every even level thereafter (execpt 6th and 12th), a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Bravery (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a fighter gains a +1 bonus on Will saves against fear. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum -4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed.</p>
			<p>In addition, a fighter can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 7th level, a fighter can move at his normal speed while wearing heavy armor.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 5th level, a fighter can select one group of weapons, as noted below. Whenever he attacks with a weapon from this group, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls.</p>
			<p>Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), a fighter becomes further trained in another group of weapons. He gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when using a weapon from this group. In addition, the bonuses granted by previous weapon groups increase by +1 each. For example, when a fighter reaches 9th level, he receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with one weapon group and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the weapon group selected at 5th level. Bonuses granted from overlapping groups do not stack. Take the highest bonus granted for a weapon if it resides in two or more groups.</p>
			<p>A fighter also adds this bonus to any combat maneuver checks made with weapons from this group. This bonus also applies to the fighter's Combat Maneuver Defense when defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against weapons from this group.</p>
			<p>Weapon groups are defined as follows (GMs may add other weapons to these groups, or add entirely new groups)</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack (Ex): </b>At 6th level, a venomblade deals 1d6 additional points of damage to targets within 30 feet that he flanks or that are denied their Dexterity bonus to AC against him. This damage increases by 1d6 every 4 levels beyond 6th.</p>
			<p><b>Viper Strike (Ex): </b>At 12th level, upon making a successful attack with a slashing or piercing weapon, the venomblade can spend a use of the ability granted by the Spit Venom feat as a swift action to spray his toxin into the wound. This imposes a &#150;4 penalty on the victim&#146;s saving throw against the poison and causes the target to take 1d6 additional points of damage from all successful attacks for 1 round. This is a poison effect.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 19th level, a fighter gains DR 5/- whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (&#215;2 becomes &#215;3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Free-style fighters are most common in Varisia, where their training&#151;students&#146; traveling study with multiple teachers, or perhaps instruction in the anything-goes mentality of the Price of Freedom school in Kaer Maga&#151;allows them to blend fighting styles into a greater whole.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The University of Lepidstadt has developed a reputation for churning out fearsome duelists. At the end of each academic year, the students all gather together and duel one another with light blades. Each student duels one opponent after another until he is marked on the cheek by an adversary&#146;s blade. These &#147;Lepidstadt scars&#148; are recognized throughout the Inner Sea region and beyond as marks of their prowess. The Lepidstadt Style is one of fluid motion and precise thrusts.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: An Ustalavic duelist is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all light and medium armor and shields (except tower shields). This replaces the fighter&#146;s normal weapon and armor proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Duelist Stance (Ex): </b>At 1st level, an Ustalavic duelist gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC as long as he is wearing no armor or light armor, wields a melee weapon in one hand, and his other hand is empty. This bonus increases by 1 for every 5 levels the duelist possesses to a maximum of +5 at 20th level. This ability replaces the fighter&#146;s 1st-level bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 2nd level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Bravery (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a fighter gains a +1 bonus on Will saves against fear. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum -4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed.</p>
			<p>In addition, a fighter can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 7th level, a fighter can move at his normal speed while wearing heavy armor.</p>
			<p><b>Duelist Training (Ex): </b>At 5th level, an Ustalavic duelist must select the light blades group for the weapon training class feature. The Ustalavic duelist&#146;s weapon training bonus with light blades increases by 1 on attack and damage rolls for every 4 levels he possesses beyond 5th (to a maximum of +4 on attack and damage rolls at 17th level). If he is using his duelist stance, this damage bonus increases by 2. The Ustalavic duelist does not gain weapon training in any other groups as he increases in level. This ability replaces weapon training 1.</p>
			<p><b>Lepidstadt Thrust (Ex): </b>At 9th level, when using Vital Strike, Improved Vital Strike, or Greater Vital Strike, an Ustalavic duelist adds his Intelligence modifier to damage rolls (this bonus to damage is not multiplied on a critical hit). If the duelist confirms a critical hit while using one of these feats, he automatically deals maximum damage. This ability replaces weapon training 2.</p>
			<p><b>Science of the Blade (Ex): </b>At 13th level, an Ustalavic duelist is able to apply his specialized knowledge of anatomy and physiology to his bladework. The duelist can make dirty trick (Advanced Player&#146;s Guide 320), disarm, and trip combat maneuvers using any one-handed piercing or slashing weapon. This ability replaces weapon training 3.</p>
			<p><b>Surgical Strike (Ex): </b>At 17th level, when an Ustalavic duelist confirms a critical hit with a light or one-handed piercing or slashing weapon, he deals ability damage in addition to the normal bonus damage from the critical hit. The duelist chooses which ability is damaged, and deals an amount of damage equal to the critical multiplier of the wielded weapon. This ability replaces weapon training 4.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 19th level, a fighter gains DR 5/- whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (&#215;2 becomes &#215;3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The unbreakable is a warrior of indomitable will, unstoppable and implacable once he has set his mind upon a course of action. The unbreakable endures any trial to do what must be done, and when his mind is set toward a goal, nothing can stop him from achieving it, though many may try. He is a juggernaut and a zealot, supremely confident in his own abilities.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (excluding tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Tough as Nails: </b>An unbreakable gains Endurance and Die Hard as bonus feats. This ability replaces the fighter&#146;s 1st-level bonus feat.</p>

			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Unflinching (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, an unbreakable gains a +1 bonus on Will saves against mind-affecting effects. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels after 2nd level (to a maximum of +5 at 18th level). This ability replaces bravery.</p>

Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum -4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed.</p>
			<p>In addition, a fighter can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 7th level, a fighter can move at his normal speed while wearing heavy armor.</p>
			<p><b>Heroic Recovery (Ex): </b>At 5th level, an unbreakable gains the Heroic Recovery feat as a bonus feat, if he does not have it already. If he already has this feat, the unbreakable can choose any combat feat instead. In addition, he may use this feat one additional time per day for every four levels after 5th (to a maximum of 4 times per day at 17th level). This ability replaces weapon training 1.</p>
			<p><b>Heroic Defiance (Ex): </b>At 9th level, an unbreakable gains the Heroic Defiance feat as a bonus feat, if he does not have it already. If he already has this feat, the unbreakable can choose any combat feat instead. In addition, he may use this feat one additional time per day for every four levels after 9th (to a maximum of 3 times per day at 19th level). This ability replaces weapon training 2.</p>
			<p><b>Quick Recovery (Ex): </b>At 11th level, an unbreakable needs only 15 minutes of rest or to be subject to a healing spell or effect to recover from the fatigued condition. This ability replaces armor training 3.</p>
			<p><b>Stalwart (Ex): </b>At 13th level, when an unbreakable succeeds on a Fortitude or Will save against a spell or spell-like ability that has a partial effect even on a successful save, he is completely unaffected by it. This ability replaces weapon training 3.</p>
			<p><b>Unlimited Endurance (Ex): </b>At 15th level, when an unbreakable is exhausted, he only suffers the effects of the fatigued condition instead, but does require 1 hour of rest to reduce this condition to the actual fatigued condition. This ability replaces armor training 4.</p>
			<p><b>Miraculous Recovery (Ex): </b>At 17th level, when an unbreakable makes a saving throw to recover from an ongoing effect, he may roll twice and choose the better roll. This ability replaces weapon training 4.</p>
			<p><b>Unbreakable Mind (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an unbreakable becomes nearly impossible to sway with honeyed words or magic. He gains immunity to mind-affecting effects. This ability replaces weapon mastery.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Not all fighters need weapons to make their mark on the world. The unarmed fighter picks up a weapon only rarely, and when he does, he prefers the weapons of the monk. There are even those who mistake them for monks, but these fighters enter the fight without ki, and instead have a tough perseverance that few can rival.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: An unarmed fighter is not proficient with medium armor, heavy armor, or shields. An unarmed fighter is proficient with all monk weapons, including exotic monk weapons.</p>
			<p><b>Unarmed Style: </b>At 1st level, a unarmed fighter gains the Improved Unarmed Strike feat and any single style feat (see Chapter 3) as a bonus feat. The unarmed fighter need not meet all the prerequisites of the style feat he chooses, but style feats that grant additional uses of the Elemental Fist feat cannot be taken until the unarmed fighter has that feat. This ability replaces the bonus feat at 1st level.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 2nd level, and at every even level thereafter (execpt for 8th and 12th), a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Harsh Training (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, an unarmed fighter gains a +1 bonus on saving throws against effects that cause the exhausted, fatigued, or staggered conditions or temporary penalties to ability scores. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels after 2nd (to a maximum of +5 at 18th level). This ability replaces bravery.</p>
			<p><b>Tough Guy (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, an unarmed fighter gains DR/&#151; equal to half his fighter level against nonlethal damage or damage taken while he is grappled. This ability replaces armor training 1.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Training (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, an unarmed fighter gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with weapons in the monk and natural weapon groups, improving by +1 for every four levels beyond 5th (to a maximum of +4 at 17th level). This ability replaces weapon training 1, 2, 3, and 4.</p>
			<p><b>Clever Wrestler (Ex): </b>At 7th level, an unarmed fighter takes no penalties to Dexterity or on attack rolls while grappled, and retains his Dexterity bonus to AC while pinning an opponent. The unarmed fighter can make attacks of opportunity even when grappled and even against creatures attempting to grapple him if the opponent has the Improved Grapple feat or the grab ability. This ability replaces armor training 2.</p>
			<p><b>Trick Throw (Ex): </b>At 8th level, when an unarmed fighter successfully trips an opponent with an unarmed attack, he can attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver against that creature (before the opponent becomes prone) as an immediate action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. This ability replaces the 8th-level bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Takedown (Ex): </b>At 12th level, if an unarmed fighter succeeds on a drag maneuver, he can attempt a trip maneuver against the same target as a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. At 15th level, he may do so after a successful grapple check. This ability replaces the 12th-level bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Eye Gouge (Ex): </b>At 13th level, if an unarmed fighter confirms a critical hit with his unarmed strike or begins his turn grappled, he may attempt a dirty trick maneuver to blind his target as a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A target more than one size category larger is unaffected. This ability replaces weapon training 3.</p>
			<p><b>Sucker Punch (Ex): </b>At 17th level, when an unarmed fighter strikes a creature that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, or that he has successfully pinned with a grapple check, he can attempt a dirty trick or trip combat maneuver against that target as a swift action. This ability replaces armor training 4.</p>
			<p><b>Sheer Toughness (Ex): </b>At 19th level, an unarmed fighter becomes immune to nonlethal damage and the exhausted, fatigued, and staggered conditions. This ability replaces armor mastery</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (&#215;2 becomes &#215;3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type. This ability applies to unarmed strikes only.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Trained under great masters who preached the simple truth that two are better than one when it comes to weapons, the two-weapon warrior is a terror when his hands are full. From paired daggers to exotic double weapons, all combinations come equally alive in his skilled hands.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (including tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Bravery (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a fighter gains a +1 bonus on Will saves against fear. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd.</p>
			<p><b>Defensive Flurry (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, when a two-weapon warrior makes a full attack with both weapons, he gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC against melee attacks until the beginning of his next turn. This bonus increases by +1 every four levels after 3rd. This ability replaces armor training 1 and 2.</p>
			<p><b>Twin Blades (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a two-weapon warrior gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when making a full attack with two weapons or a double weapon. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels after 5th. This ability replaces weapon training 1.</p>
			<p><b>Doublestrike (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a two-weapon warrior may, as a standard action, make one attack with both his primary and secondary weapons. The penalties for attacking with two weapons apply normally. This ability replaces weapon training 2.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Balance (Ex): </b>At 11th level, the attack penalties for fighting with two weapons are reduced by &#150;1 for a two-weapon warrior. Alternatively, he may use a one-handed weapon in his off-hand, treating it as if it were a light weapon with the normal light weapon penalties. This ability replaces armor training 3.</p>
			<p><b>Equal Opportunity (Ex): </b>At 13th level, when a two-weapon warrior makes an attack of opportunity, he may attack once with both his primary and secondary weapons. The penalties for attacking with two weapons apply normally. This ability replaces weapon training 3.</p>
			<p><b>Perfect Balance (Ex): </b>At 15th level, the penalties for fighting with two weapons are reduced by an additional &#150;1 for a two-weapon warrior. This benefit stacks with improved balance. If he is using a one-handed weapon in his off hand, treating it as a light weapon, he uses the normal light weapon penalties. This ability replaces armor training 4.</p>
			<p><b>Deft Doublestrike (Ex): </b>At 17th level, when a two-weapon warrior hits an opponent with both weapons, he can make a disarm or sunder attempt (or trip, if one or both weapons can be used to trip) against that opponent as an immediate action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. This ability replaces weapon training 4.</p>
			<p><b>Deadly Defense (Ex): </b>At 19th level, when a two-weapon warrior makes a full attack with both weapons, every creature that hits him with a melee attack before the beginning of his next turn provokes an attack of opportunity from the warrior. This ability replaces armor mastery.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (&#215;2 becomes &#215;3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some fighters focus their efforts on finding the biggest, heaviest, most imposing weapon they can find and training to manage and harness the weight of their massive weapons for maximum impact. These fighting school benefits only apply when using two-handed weapons.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (including tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Shattering Strike (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a two-handed fighter gains a +1 bonus to CMB and CMD on sunder attempts and on damage rolls made against objects. These bonuses increase by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd. This ability replaces bravery.</p>
			<p><b>Overhand Chop (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, when a two-handed fighter makes a single attack (with the attack action or a charge) with a two-handed weapon, he adds double his Strength bonus on damage rolls. This ability replaces armor training 1.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Training (Ex) </b>: As the fighter class feature, but the bonuses only apply when wielding two-handed melee weapons.</p>
			<p>Starting at 5th level, a fighter can select one group of weapons, as noted below. Whenever he attacks with a weapon from this group, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls.</p>
			<p>Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), a fighter becomes further trained in another group of weapons. He gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when using a weapon from this group. In addition, the bonuses granted by previous weapon groups increase by +1 each. For example, when a fighter reaches 9th level, he receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with one weapon group and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the weapon group selected at 5th level. Bonuses granted from overlapping groups do not stack. Take the highest bonus granted for a weapon if it resides in two or more groups.</p>
			<p>A fighter also adds this bonus to any combat maneuver checks made with weapons from this group. This bonus also applies to the fighter's Combat Maneuver Defense when defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against weapons from this group.</p>
			<p>Weapon groups are defined as follows (GMs may add other weapons to these groups, or add entirely new groups)</p>
			<p><b>Backswing (Ex): </b>At 7th level, when a two-handed fighter makes a full attack with a two-handed weapon, he adds double his Strength bonus on damage rolls for all attacks after the first. This ability replaces armor training 2.</p>
			<p><b>Piledriver (Ex): </b>At 11th level, as a standard action, a two-handed fighter can make a single melee attack with a two-handed weapon. If the attack hits, he may make a bull rush or trip combat maneuver against the target of his attack as a free action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. This ability replaces armor training 3.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Power Attack (Ex): </b>At 15th level, when using Power Attack with a two-handed melee weapon, the bonus damage from Power Attack is doubled (+100%) instead of increased by half (+50%). This ability replaces armor training 4.</p>
			<p><b>Devastating Blow (Ex): </b>At 19th level, as a standard action, a two-handed fighter may make a single melee attack with a two-handed weapon at a &#150;5 penalty. If the attack hits, it is treated as a critical threat. Special weapon abilities that activate only on a critical hit do not activate if this critical hit is confirmed. This ability replaces armor mastery.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (&#215;2 becomes &#215;3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A tribal fighter knows that it is not the weapon that matters but the hand that wields it. Instead of encasing himself in metal armor like the soldiers fighting and dying for the socalled civilized lands do, he prefers to wear something he or his ancestors have killed. These relics and trophies help the tribal fighter attain a battle focus that allows him to perform incredible feats of violence with the simplest of weapons.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (including tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Forbidden Armor: </b>A tribal fighter favors traditional armor and shields, avoiding other types out of spiritual devotion, superstitious suspicion, or respect for tradition. He can attain his battle focus (see page 51) only while using armaments of the appropriate types. Like a druid, a tribal fighter is prohibited from wearing metal armor and using metal shields. A tribal fighter who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield loses the benefits of the battle focus and tribal weapon training abilities while doing so and for 24 hours after removing the prohibited armor or shield.</p>
			<p><b>Battle Focus (Ex) </b>: A tribal fighter learns to fight with his bare hands and wield traditional tribal weapons so effortlessly that they are almost extensions of his arms. He gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. For the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of style feats and feats that have style feats as prerequisites, the tribal fighter counts as having a number of skill ranks equal to his fighter level in all skills in which he is trained.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 2nd level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Bravery (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a fighter gains a +1 bonus on Will saves against fear. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum -4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed.</p>
			<p>In addition, a fighter can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 7th level, a fighter can move at his normal speed while wearing heavy armor.</p>
			<p><b>Tribal Weapon Training (Ex): </b>At 5th level, when a tribal fighter gains the weapon training ability, he must choose the tribal weapon group and doesn&#146;t later gain additional weapon groups, though the weapon training bonus for tribal weapons still improves at 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter. Additionally, if the tribal fighter has combat feats that apply to a specific weapon type (such as Improved Critical or Weapon Focus) and he has selected a weapon that belongs to the tribal weapon group, he can apply the benefits of that feat to all weapons that belong to the tribal weapon group that would legally apply (for instance, a feat that applies only to throwing weapons wouldn&#146;t apply to greatclubs). This benefit applies only to feats selected as fighter bonus feats.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 19th level, a fighter gains DR 5/- whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (&#215;2 becomes &#215;3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Advances in technology have made archaic armors obsolete by the twentieth century, and modern soldiers concentrate training on firearms and swift feet.</i></p>
			<p>This archetype was introduced in a section on Modern Firearms, where guns were treated as the 'guns everywhere' mechanic. GMs may wish to read the appropriate section in Pathfinder #71 to see if this is suitable for their game.</p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (including tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level).

A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Many fighters believe the tower shield is a tool suitable only for troops on the battlefield, claiming it is too large and bulky to use in skirmishes or within dungeon corridors. Tower shield specialists defy those notions, using their massive shields with startling skill and incredible effect. They use these seemingly clumsy shields to perform deft maneuvers that confound their enemies.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Burst Barrier (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a tower shield specialist can use his shield to screen himself from burst spells and effects, gaining a +1 bonus on Reflex saves against them while employing a tower shield. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels after 2nd (to a maximum of +5 at 18th level). This ability replaces bravery.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Training (Ex): </b>Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum -4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed.In addition, a fighter can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 7th level, a fighter can move at his normal speed while wearing heavy armor.</p>

			<p><b>Tower Shield Training (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a tower shield specialist gains armor training as normal, but while he employs a tower shield, the armor penalty is reduced by 3 and the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor increases by 2. The benefit increases every four levels thereafter as per standard armor training; if the tower shield specialist is not employing a tower shield, the benefits to armor training revert to the normal bonuses.</p>
			<p><b>Tower Shield Specialist (Ex): </b>At 5th level, when a tower shield specialist employs a tower shield in combat, he does not take the &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls because of the shield&#146;s encumbrance. This ability replaces weapon training 1.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Titan fighters make use of enormous weapons others can barely lift. Titan fighters have the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (including tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Giant Weapon Wielder (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a titan fighter can wield two-handed melee weapons intended for creatures one size category larger than himself, treating them as two-handed weapons. He takes an additional &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls when using an oversized two-handed weapon. This ability replaces the fighter&#146;s 1st level bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 2nd level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Bravery (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a fighter gains a +1 bonus on Will saves against fear. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd.</p>
			<p><b>Incredible Heft (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a titan fighter becomes more skilled at wielding weapons intended for creatures one size category larger than himself. The penalty on attack rolls for using such weapons is reduced by 1, including when using oversized two-handed weapons. At 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter, this penalty is reduced by another 1 (minimum 0). This ability replaces armor training.</p>
			<p><b>Unstoppable Momentum (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a titan fighter gains a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks and to CMD while wielding a weapon sized for a creature of a larger size category. At 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1. When wielding oversized weapons, the titan fighter can attempt to bull rush, drag, overrun, reposition, and trip creatures up to two sizes categories larger than himself. This ability replaces weapon training.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 19th level, a fighter gains DR 5/- whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (&#215;2 becomes &#215;3, for example).

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The thunderstriker adopts an unusual fighting style, gripping a heavy weapon with both hands and switching to a defensive posture with weapon and buckler, lashing out with the shield with surprising speed and power.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Taldor&#146;s warriors have perfected the art of fighting with the falcata and buckler in an art they call rondelero. They use their bucklers both to defend themselves and to launch unexpected strikes while chopping and hewing at their foes&#146; unprotected bodies and heads with their falcatas. Rondeleros wear any type of armor, but favor bucklers, and are comfortable using both hands for offense and defense.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>While many fighters focus on the fundamentals of melee and ranged combat, there are those who are trained to view the bigger picture on the battlefield. These fighters use their training and tactical acumen to overcome challenges that would overwhelm mere brute strength and skill at arms.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (including tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: A tactician may choose Skill Focus or any teamwork feat, in addition to combat feats, as bonus feats.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Strategic Training (Ex): </b>A tactician gains 4 skill points + a number of skill points equal to his Intelligence modifier at each level, instead of the normal 2 skill points + Intelligence modifier at each level. Furthermore, Diplomacy (Cha), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Linguistics (Int), and Sense Motive (Wis) are all class skills for the tactician. This ability replaces the bonus fighter combat feat gained at 1st level.</p>
			<p><b>Tactical Awareness (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a tactician gains a +1 bonus on initiative checks. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels after 2nd level (to a maximum of +5 at 18th level). This ability replaces bravery.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. At 7th level, these bonuses increase by +1.</p>
			<p>In addition, a fighter can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 7th level, a fighter can move at his normal speed while wearing heavy armor.</p>
			<p><b>Tactician (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a tactician gains this ability as the cavalier class feature. He may use this ability once per day at 5th level, plus one additional time for every five levels after 5th (to a maximum of four times at 20th level). If the tactician also has cavalier levels, these levels stack for determining the number of uses per day, and he can take the better progression. This ability replaces weapon training 1.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 9th level, a fighter can select one group of weapons, as noted below. Whenever he attacks with a weapon from this group, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls.</p>
			<p>Every four levels thereafter (13th, and 17th), a fighter becomes further trained in another group of weapons. He gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when using a weapon from this group. In addition, the bonuses granted by previous weapon groups increase by +1 each. For example, when a fighter reaches 9th level, he receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with one weapon group and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the weapon group selected at 5th level. Bonuses granted from overlapping groups do not stack. Take the highest bonus granted for a weapon if it resides in two or more groups.</p>
			<p>A fighter also adds this bonus to any combat maneuver checks made with weapons from this group. This bonus also applies to the fighter's Combat Maneuver Defense when defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against weapons from this group.</p>
			<p>Weapon groups are defined as follows (GMs may add other weapons to these groups, or add entirely new groups) -</p>
			<p><b>Cooperative Combatant (Ex): </b>At 11th level, when a tactician uses the aid another special attack, he may affect one additional ally per point of Intelligence bonus. For each ally that a tactician aids, he can pick whether to grant that ally the +2 bonus on its next attack against the opponent or the +2 bonus to AC against the opponent&#146;s next attack on that ally, and can grant different allies different bonuses. This ability replaces armor training 3.</p>
			<p><b>Battle Insight (Ex): </b>At 15th level, as a swift action, a tactician can grant his Intelligence modifier as an insight bonus on the attack rolls made by a single ally within line of sight that can both see and hear the tactician. That ally gains the bonus until the end of the tactician&#146;s next turn. The tactician can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Intelligence modifier. This ability replaces armor training 4.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 19th level, a fighter gains DR 5/- whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (&#215;2 becomes &#215;3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Kobolds know there&#146;s strength in numbers, and they rarely send fewer than two kobolds out on patrol. This reliance on one another extends to combat tactics too&#151; overwhelming numbers and tight quarters are the kobold fighter&#146;s friends. Scuttling between the legs of friend and foe alike, the swarm fighter is an unshakable combatant.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Race: </b>Kobold Only</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A swarm fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons. She is proficient with light and medium armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Athletic Prowess (Ex): </b>A swarm fighter adds Acrobatics and Climb to her class skills, and gains a bonus on checks with these skills equal to 1/2 her swarm fighter level.</p>
			<p><b>Mobility (Ex): </b>The swarm fighter gains Mobility as a bonus feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites. This replaces the bonus feat a fighter gains at first level, and can&#146;t be replaced at a later level.</p>
			<p><b>Safety in Numbers (Ex): </b>A swarm fighter benefits greatly from the proximity of her allies. She gains a morale bonus on saves against fear effects equal to the number of allies within 20 feet of her. This bonus can&#146;t exceed half her level.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Teamwork Feats (Ex): </b>At 2nd level and every 4 levels thereafter, the swarm fighter gains a bonus Teamwork Feat. This ability replaces the bonus combat feats the fighter normally receives at those levels.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum -4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed.</p>
			<p>In addition, a fighter can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 7th level, a fighter can move at his normal speed while wearing heavy armor.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat: </b>At 4th level, and at every gour levels thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Share Space (Ex): </b>At 5th level, the swarm fighter can move into the space of another creature at least one size category larger than she is. She may end her movement in, and make attacks from, that space. She must succeed at the Acrobatics check for moving through an occupied square to move into a space occupied by an enemy. While sharing the space of another creature, she gains a +2 shield bonus to AC and a +1 circumstance bonus on Reflex saves. This ability replaces weapon training 1.</p>
			<p><b>Strike the Underbelly (Ex): </b>At 9th level, creatures with which the swarm fighter shares a space are denied their Dexterity bonus to Armor Class against the swam fighter&#146;s attacks. This ability replaces weapon training 2.</p>
			<p><b>Always Underfoot (Ex): </b>At 13th level, the swarm fighter gains Step Up as a bonus feat. A creature sharing a square with the swarm fighter is considered adjacent for the purposes of this feat. At 17th level, the swarm fighter gains Following Step as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 19th level, a fighter gains DR 5/- whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Not all battles are fought between armies; sometimes, a settlement or nation faces a threat too dire to fight in the open. In order to repel a much larger enemy force, some soldiers must abandon equipment and tactics designed for open-field warfare and instead rely on ambushes, hit-andrun tactics, and sabotage to whittle down their enemies&#146; strength and morale. Skirmishers use harsh weather and unforgiving terrain to their advantage, attacking isolated groups of enemies that cannot flee or fight back effectively. Many tribal warriors also employ small-unit tactics because it is part of their warrior culture, because they cannot field a large army, or simply because they refuse to fight on the enemy&#146;s terms.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A skirmisher is proficient with light armor and shields but not with medium armor, heavy armor, or tower shields.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter starting at 4th level, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Wilderness Training (Ex): </b>A skirmisher relies on his skills and the element of surprise rather than the heaviest shields and armor. He gains Acrobatics and Stealth as class skills. In addition, the skirmisher gains a number of skill ranks at each level equal to 4 + his Intelligence modifier, instead of 2 + his Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Conditioning (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a skirmisher becomes more resistant to mental and physical threats that are commonly employed by his enemies or often encountered in the terrain in which he operates. The skirmisher must choose one of the specializations below, gaining a +1 bonus on saving throws of the appropriate type. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels beyond 2nd.</p>
			<p><i>Alpine Training (Ex): </i>A skirmisher operating in mountainous terrain becomes resistant to cold climates and the rigors of long treks at high altitudes. He gains a bonus on Fortitude saving throws against altitude sickness, exposure to cold weather, and other effects that cause fatigue or exhaustion.</p>
			<p><i>Counter-Interrogation Training (Ex): </i>A skirmisher undertaking infiltration missions learns to resist interrogation and persuasion. The skirmisher gains a bonus on Will saving throws against charms and divinations.</p>
			<p><i>Jungle Training (Ex): </i>Through repeated exposure, a skirmisher operating in jungles and wetlands builds up a tolerance against pathogens and toxins. He gains a bonus on Fortitude saving throws against disease and poison.</p>
			<p><i>Light Infantry Training (Ex): </i>A skirmisher fighting in a light infantry unit learns to avoid fire from enemy artillery, siege weapons, and spellcasters. He gains a bonus on Reflex saving throws against attacks that deal half damage on a successful save (such as the fireball spell) but not against traps, natural hazards, or environmental effects.</p>
			<p><b>Reconnaissance Training (Ex): </b>A skirmisher operating in heavily trapped or naturally hazardous areas learns to expertly avoid them. At 2nd level, he gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saving throws to avoid traps, natural hazards, and environmental effects. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels beyond 2nd.</p>
			<p><b>Mobility Training (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a skirmisher learns to be more maneuverable while wearing light or no armor. He gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC while wearing light or no armor and while carrying no more than a light load. Anything that causes the skirmisher to lose his Dexterity bonus to AC also causes the skirmisher to lose this dodge bonus. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels beyond 3rd (to a maximum of +4 at 15th level).</p>
			<p>In addition, a skirmisher gains an enhancement bonus of +5 feet to his base speed. At 7th level, the bonus increases to +10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor or light armor, and when he is carrying no more than a light load.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 5th level, a fighter can select one group of weapons, as noted below. Whenever he attacks with a weapon from this group, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls.</p>
			<p>Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), a fighter becomes further trained in another group of weapons. He gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when using a weapon from this group. In addition, the bonuses granted by previous weapon groups increase by +1 each. For example, when a fighter reaches 9th level, he receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with one weapon group and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the weapon group selected at 5th level. Bonuses granted from overlapping groups do not stack. Take the highest bonus granted for a weapon if it resides in two or more groups.</p>
			<p>A fighter also adds this bonus to any combat maneuver checks made with weapons from this group. This bonus also applies to the fighter's Combat Maneuver Defense when defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against weapons from this group.</p>
			<p>Weapon groups are defined as follows (GMs may add other weapons to these groups, or add entirely new groups) -</p>
			<p><b>Mobile Mastery (Ex): </b>At 19th level, a skirmisher learns to position his body and conceal his body proportions with clothes so well that it is difficult to hit him. He gains a 20% miss chance on attacks against him. Mobile mastery functions even when the skirmisher is flat-footed, but not when he is immobilized or helpless, when he wears medium or heavy armor, or when he carries a medium or heavy load.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (&#215;2 becomes &#215;3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The siegebreaker is trained to break through lines of enemy soldiers.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (including tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Breaker Rush (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a siegebreaker can attempt bull rush or overrun combat maneuvers without provoking attacks of opportunity. When he performs either combat maneuver, he deals an amount of bludgeoning damage equal to his Strength bonus (minimum 1). If he has Improved Bull Rush or Improved Overrun, the damage dealt by the appropriate maneuver increases by 2 and he adds any enhancement bonus from his armor or shield (though such enhancement bonuses do not stack, if both armor and shield are magic). This ability replaces the feat gained at 1st level.</p>
			<p><b>Armored Vigor (Ex): </b>At 2nd level as a swift action, a siegebreaker can gain 2 temporary hit points that last for 1 minute. He can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Constitution modifier (minimum 1 per day), but only while wearing armor. At 6th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the number of temporary hit points the siegebreaker gains increases by 2, to a maximum of 10 at 18th level. This ability replaces bravery.</p>
			<p><b>Breaker Momentum (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, when a siegebreaker successfully bull rushes a foe, he can attempt an overrun combat maneuver check against that foe as a free action. This ability replaces the feat gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum -4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed.</p>
			<p>In addition, a fighter can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 7th level, a fighter can move at his normal speed while wearing heavy armor.</p>
			<p><b>Persistent Menace (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a siegebreaker must choose either Step Up or Disruptive as his bonus feat, but need not meet the prerequisites.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 5th level, a fighter can select one group of weapons, as noted below. Whenever he attacks with a weapon from this group, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls.</p>
			<p>Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), a fighter becomes further trained in another group of weapons. He gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when using a weapon from this group. In addition, the bonuses granted by previous weapon groups increase by +1 each. For example, when a fighter reaches 9th level, he receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with one weapon group and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the weapon group selected at 5th level. Bonuses granted from overlapping groups do not stack. Take the highest bonus granted for a weapon if it resides in two or more groups.</p>
			<p>A fighter also adds this bonus to any combat maneuver checks made with weapons from this group. This bonus also applies to the fighter's Combat Maneuver Defense when defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against weapons from this group.</p>
			<p>Weapon groups are defined as follows (GMs may add other weapons to these groups, or add entirely new groups) -</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat: </b>At 6th level, and at every even level thereafter starting at 10th level, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 10th level, and every four levels thereafter (12th, 14th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Disorienting Blow (Ex): </b>At 8th level, as an immediate action, a siegebreaker can distract a foe he just hit with an attack or combat maneuver, imposing a &#150;2 penalty on the foe&#146;s attack rolls, caster level checks, or skill checks for 1 round. The foe can negate this penalty with a successful Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the siegebreaker&#146;s fighter level + his Strength modifier). At 14th level, the penalty increases to &#150;4. This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 8th level.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 19th level, a fighter gains DR 5/- whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Distraction (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a siegebreaker can nauseate a foe he targets with his disorienting blow instead of inflicting a penalty. This ability replaces weapon mastery.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A shielded fighter focuses on both offense and defense, blending weapon and shield in perfect balance to impede his enemies while delivering deadly blows, and even turning the shield itself into a formidable weapon. These fighting school benefits apply when wielding a weapon and a shield simultaneously.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (including tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Bravery (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a fighter gains a +1 bonus on Will saves against fear. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd.</p>
			<p><b>Active Defense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a shielded fighter gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC when wielding a shield and fighting defensively, using Combat Expertise, or using total defense. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 3rd. As a swift action, he may share this bonus with one adjacent ally, or half of the bonus (minimum +0) with all adjacent allies, until the beginning of his next turn. This ability replaces armor training 1, 2, 3, and 4.</p>
			<p><b>Shield Fighter (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a shielded fighter gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when making a shield bash. These bonuses increase by +1 every four levels beyond 5th. With a full attack action, a shielded fighter may alternate between using his weapon or his shield for each attack. This action does not grant additional attacks or incur penalties as two-weapon fighting does. This ability replaces weapon training 1.</p>
			<p><b>Shield Buffet (Ex): </b>At 9th level, as a move action, a shielded fighter may make a combat maneuver check to use his shield to impede an adjacent enemy. If successful, the target suffers a &#150;2 penalty on its attack rolls against the shielded fighter and a &#150;2 penalty to AC on attacks made by the shielded fighter until the beginning of his next turn.</p>
			<p>At 13th level, a shielded fighter may use this ability as a swift action. This ability replaces weapon training 2 and 3.</p>
			<p><b>Shield Guard (Ex): </b>At 17th level, as a swift action, a shielded fighter may designate one square adjacent to him. He may designate two squares if using a heavy shield or three squares if using a tower shield, but these squares must be contiguous. Enemies in these squares cannot flank the shielded fighter and do not count for flanking with other creatures. This effect lasts until he moves from his position or uses another swift action to change the affected squares. This ability replaces weapon training 4.</p>
			<p><b>Shield Mastery (Ex): </b>At 19th level, a shielded fighter gains DR 5/&#151; when wielding a shield. This ability replaces armor mastery.</p>
			<p><b>Shield Ward (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a shielded fighter gains evasion (as a rogue) while wielding a shield, and adds his shield bonus to his AC (not including enhancement bonuses) on Reflex saves and to his touch AC. In addition, his shield cannot be disarmed or sundered. This ability replaces weapon mastery.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A sensate perceives battle through senses beyond mortal ken, anticipating his opponents&#146; movements before they even begin to act. As long as he keeps his focus about him, he fights with a skill rivaling that of the finest masters-at-arms.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The sensate&#146;s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: Sensates are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). This replaces the fighter&#146;s weapon and armor proficiency.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Guarded Senses (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a sensate gains a +1 bonus on saves against sonic effects, figments, glamers, patterns, gaze attacks, and scent-based attacks. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels the sensate possesses beyond 2nd. This ability replaces bravery.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a sensate gains uncanny dodge as the barbarian ability of the same name, except supernatural in nature. This ability replaces armor training 1.</p>
			<p><b>Centered Senses (Su): </b>At 5th level, a sensate can center his senses as a move action. While centered, a sensate gains a +1 insight bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and Will saves. This bonus increases by 1 at 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter. A sensate loses his centered state if he gains the confused, dazed, fascinated, staggered, or stunned condition; falls unconscious; or fails a Will save. This ability replaces weapon training 2, 3, and 4.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Su): </b>At 7th level, a sensate gains improved uncanny dodge as the barbarian ability of the same name, except supernatural in nature. This ability replaces armor training 2.</p>
			<p><b>Evasion (Su): </b>At 11th level, a sensate gains evasion while using centered senses. This functions as the rogue ability of the same name, except that it is supernatural in nature and works regardless of the sensate&#146;s armor and encumbrance. This ability replaces armor training 3.</p>
			<p><b>Steady (Su): </b>At 15th level, a sensate can center himself as a swift action. This ability replaces armor training 4.</p>
			<p><b>Perfect Senses (Su): </b>At 19th level, a sensate&#146;s senses reach perfection, and he can easily notice illusions and unseen foes by combining his senses. While centered, he gains the effects of true seeing as well as blindsense 60 feet. An unseen creature that makes no sound and leaves no scent (such as a creature under the effects of invisibility, silence, and negate aroma) can still avoid both the true seeing and the blindsense. This ability replaces armor mastery.</p>
			<p><b>Precision (Su): </b>At 20th level, a sensate rolls twice to confirm critical hits while centered, taking the more favorable result. Opponents must roll twice to confirm critical hits against him, taking the less favorable result. The latter ability does not function when the sensate is denied his Dexterity bonus. This ability replaces weapon mastery.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The seasoned commander excels at leading troops through inspiration and the use of unit tactics.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light and medium armor and shields (excluding tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Strategic Training (Ex): </b>A seasoned commander gains 4 skill ranks + a number of skill ranks equal to his Intelligence modifier at each level instead of the normal 2 skill ranks + Intelligence modifier at each level. A seasoned commander adds Diplomacy, Knowledge (geography), Knowledge (nobility), Linguistics, and Sense Motive to his list of class skills.</p>
			<p>This alters the fighter&#146;s skill ranks per level and class skills, and replaces the bonus fighter combat feat gained at 1st level and proficiency with heavy armor and tower shields.</p>
			<p><b>Bravery (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a fighter gains a +1 bonus on Will saves against fear. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd.</p>
			<p><b>Tactician (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a seasoned commander gains the cavalier&#146;s tactician class feature, treating his fighter level as his cavalier level for the purposes of this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiring Speech (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a seasoned commander can give an inspiring speech as a standard action once per day. If he does, all allies who can hear his speech gain the benefits of inspire courage, granting bonuses 1 lower than those granted by a bard of the seasoned commander&#146;s fighter level, lasting 1 round per fighter level + his Charisma modifier (abilities that affect a bardic performance, such as Lingering Performance, have no effect on this ability). At 7th level, he can perform the speech as a move action, and at 13th level, he can perform the speech as a swift action.</p>
			<p><b>Inspire Greatness (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a seasoned commander gains an additional daily use of his inspiring speech ability, and he can also choose to use his inspiring speech to grant the effects of inspire greatness to one ally (instead of inspire courage). For every 2 levels a seasoned commander attains beyond 9th, he can target one additional ally while using this ability (up to a maximum of six at 19th level). This ability functions in all other respects like the seasoned commander&#146;s inspire courage ability. Whichever inspiring speech he chooses to use, if the seasoned commander uses an inspiring speech before the duration of his previous inspiring speech ends, the new inspiring speech replaces the old speech.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Tactician (Ex): </b>At 11th level, the seasoned commander gains the cavalier&#146;s greater tactician class feature, treating his fighter level as his cavalier level for the purposes of this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Inspire Heroics (Ex): </b>At 15th level, a seasoned commander gains an additional daily use of his inspiring speech, and he can also choose to use his inspiring speech to grant the effects of inspire heroics to one ally (instead of inspire courage or inspire greatness). For every 2 levels a seasoned commander attains beyond 15th, he can target one additional ally while using this ability. This ability functions in all other respects like the seasoned commander&#146;s inspire courage ability.</p>
			<p><b>Master Tactician (Ex): </b>At 17th level, the seasoned commander gains the cavalier&#146;s master tactician class feature, treating his fighter level as his cavalier level for the purposes of this ability.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 19th level, a fighter gains DR 5/- whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (&#215;2 becomes &#215;3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level, a scrapper learns to salvage scrap from constructs or other pieces of armor and attach them to his own armor. Salvaging scrap from a destroyed construct or from another creature&#146;s armor takes 1 minute. Scrap from a construct grants the scrapper a natural armor bonus to AC equal to one-quarter the construct&#146;s Hit Dice (minimum +1). If the scrap is salvaged from a piece of armor, it instead grants a natural armor bonus to AC equal to 1 + the armor&#146;s enhancement bonus (if any). The salvaged armor piece is flimsy and prone to breaking. Scrap is immediately destroyed by any sunder combat maneuver that targets the armor to which the scrap is attached. Otherwise, scrap crumbles and falls away after a number of days equal to the natural armor bonus that it grants. At 11th level, scrap salvaged from a construct also grants DR/adamantine equal to one-quarter of the construct&#146;s Hit Dice.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Scrappers are adept at collecting the leftovers from their enemy&#146;s armor and using these scraps to improve their own armor.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (including tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned.

A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Warriors&#146; might is not measured only by their skill with steel, but also by their ability to inflict death with fang and claw, horn and hoof, and every exotic appendage the natural and unnatural world has to offer.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (including tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level).

			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Spark of Life (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a savage warrior gains a +1 bonus on saving throws made against energy drain and death effects. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd. This ability replaces bravery.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Roughriders study and practice the fine points of mounted combat, drilling endlessly with warbeasts&#151;from noble thoroughbreds to trained monsters&#151;to form a perfect synergy between rider and steed.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (including tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Steadfast Mount (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, after a roughrider has spent 1 hour practicing with a mount, the mount gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC and a +1 morale bonus on saves, but only while the roughrider is mounted on it or adjacent to it. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels after 2nd. This ability replaces bravery.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Commonly trained in the well-funded temples of Osirion or Qadira, the relic master is skilled in magic item mastery.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>In Qadira, home of the whirlwind, the scorpion, and the djinni, no enemy is as feared as the dervishes of Sarenrae. While dervishes can be clerics, paladins, or rangers, zealous fighters join their ranks as well. These spinning warriors prefer light or no armor and wield scimitars with devastating consequences, moving swiftly over the treacherous desert sands to attack with lightning-fast strikes. They maneuver quickly among their enemies, relying on their speed and their skill to see them through the battle.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The polearm master is schooled in the ancient wisdom that enemies are best faced at the end of long striking pole, lashing like a serpent before clumsy swords and axes can even be brought to bear.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (including tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned.

A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Pole Fighting (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, as an immediate action, a polearm master can shorten the grip on his spear or polearm with reach and use it against adjacent targets. This action results in a &#150;4 penalty on attack rolls with that weapon until he spends another immediate action to return to the normal grip. The penalty is reduced by &#150;1 for every four levels beyond 2nd. This ability replaces bravery.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The phalanx soldier specializes in defensive tactics, using his shield to guard himself and his allies and forming a shield wall like an unbreakable anvil against which his enemies break.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Pack mules carry heavy loads with ease and small packages with discretion. Unlike most couriers or porters, pack mules are also trained combatants able to defend their charges should the need arise. Many are willing to transport illegal goods, serving as runners for smugglers or muscle for bandits. Pack mules seeking legitimate work prove useful additions to merchant caravans and adventuring parties.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Disguise (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Opportunists believe every battle is one of wits rather than arms. The ratfolk enforcers who protect Goka&#146;s infamous Deepmarket embrace this philosophy, unleashing a disorienting mix of martial skill and alchemical weaponry.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (including tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Duplicitous (Ex): </b>An opportunist adds Bluff, Sense Motive, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth to his list of class skills. He gains 2 bonus skill ranks at each level, which must be allocated among these skills. This ability replaces bravery and alters the fighter&#146;s class skills.</p>
			<p><b>Underhanded (Ex): </b>An opportunist gains Improved Dirty TrickAPG as a bonus feat at 1st level even if he does not meet the prerequisites. This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 1st level.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat: </b>At 2nd level, and at every four levels thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 6th level, and every four levels thereafter (10th, 14th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum -4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed.</p>
			<p>In addition, a fighter can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 7th level, a fighter can move at his normal speed while wearing heavy armor.</p>
			<p><b>Cunning Edge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, an opportunist can select an edge from those listed below. Every 4 levels beyond 4th, he can select one additional edge, to a maximum of five at level 20.</p>
			<p><i>Alchemical Admixture (Ex): </i>As a full round action that provokes an attack of opportunity, the opportunist can combine two alchemical weapons into a single vial. When thrown as a splash weapon, the mixture has the effects of both component substances and targets are affected as if hit by both. The mixture becomes inert after 1 hour. Combining identical alchemical weapons has no effect. The opportunist can use this ability once per day for every 4 fighter levels he has.</p>
			<p><i>Alchemical Refinement (Ex): </i>The opportunist increases the save DC of any alchemical item he crafts by 1 for every 3 fighter levels he has. Doing so increases the raw material cost to craft that item by 10 gp for every +1 increase. This bonus applies only when the opportunist uses the crafted alchemical item himself; it functions as a normal item of its type for all other users.</p>
			<p><i>Bombs (Ex): </i>The opportunist can make a number of bombs per day equal to his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). These bombs act as alchemist&#146;s bombs and deal 1d6 points of fire damage, plus an additional 1d6 points for every 3 fighter levels the opportunist has.</p>
			<p><i>Clouded Shift (Ex): </i>As part of the standard action to ignite a smokestick or smoke pellet (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 105), the opportunist can take a 5-foot step, even if he has already moved this round. He can use this ability only if he has not already taken a 5-foot step this round, and only if the smoke from his alchemical tool conceals his starting location.</p>
			<p><i>Poison Use (Ex): </i>The opportunist no longer risks poisoning himself when applying poison to a weapon.</p>
			<p><i>Rogue Talent (Ex): </i>The opportunist can select one of the following rogue talents for which he qualifies, treating his fighter level as his rogue level: deft palm, fast fingers, fast stealth, honeyed words, lasting poison, minor magic, or quick trapsmith. The opportunist can select this edge multiple times.</p>
			<p><b>Alchemical Onslaught (Ex): </b>At 5th level, an opportunist gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls with alchemical weapons and bombs and can add his Intelligence modifier to damage rolls for splash weapons. He can draw an alchemical weapon as a free action once per round.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 9th level, a fighter can select one group of weapons, as noted below. Whenever he attacks with a weapon from this group, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls.</p>
			<p>Every four levels thereafter (13th, and 17th), a fighter becomes further trained in another group of weapons. He gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when using a weapon from this group. In addition, the bonuses granted by previous weapon groups increase by +1 each. For example, when a fighter reaches 9th level, he receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with one weapon group and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the weapon group selected at 5th level. Bonuses granted from overlapping groups do not stack. Take the highest bonus granted for a weapon if it resides in two or more groups.</p>
			<p>A fighter also adds this bonus to any combat maneuver checks made with weapons from this group. This bonus also applies to the fighter's Combat Maneuver Defense when defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against weapons from this group.</p>
			<p>Weapon groups are defined as follows (GMs may add other weapons to these groups, or add entirely new groups) -</p>
			<p><b>Armor Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 19th level, a fighter gains DR 5/- whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (&#215;2 becomes &#215;3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>While most fighters rely on physical fitness and rigorous training to achieve martial superiority, a few prefer to create and imbibe dangerous concoctions that mutate them into fearsome creatures.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (including tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Bravery (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a fighter gains a +1 bonus on Will saves against fear. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd.</p>
			<p><b>Mutagen (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a mutation warrior discovers how to create a mutagen that he can imbibe in order to heighten his physical prowess at the cost of his personality. This ability functions as the alchemist&#146;s mutagen ability (Advanced Player&#146;s Guide 28), using his fighter level as his alchemist level. This ability replaces armor training 1.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 5th level, a fighter can select one group of weapons, as noted below. Whenever he attacks with a weapon from this group, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls.</p>
			<p>Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), a fighter becomes further trained in another group of weapons. He gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when using a weapon from this group. In addition, the bonuses granted by previous weapon groups increase by +1 each. For example, when a fighter reaches 9th level, he receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with one weapon group and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the weapon group selected at 5th level. Bonuses granted from overlapping groups do not stack. Take the highest bonus granted for a weapon if it resides in two or more groups.</p>
			<p>A fighter also adds this bonus to any combat maneuver checks made with weapons from this group. This bonus also applies to the fighter's Combat Maneuver Defense when defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against weapons from this group.</p>
			<p>Weapon groups are defined as follows (GMs may add other weapons to these groups, or add entirely new groups).</p>
			<p><b>Mutagen Discovery (Su): </b>At 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the mutation warrior can choose one of the following alchemist discoveries (Advanced Player&#146;s Guide 28) to augment his abilities: feral mutagen, grand mutagen, greater mutagen, infuse mutagen, nauseating fleshUC, preserve organsUM, rag doll mutagenARG, spontaneous healingUM, tentacleUM, vestigial armUM, wingsUM. The mutagen warrior uses his fighter level as his effective alchemist level for the purpose of these discoveries. This ability replaces armor training 2, 3, 4, and armor mastery.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 19th level, a fighter gains DR 5/- whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (&#215;2 becomes &#215;3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Molthuni defenders occupy and protect contested territory in their war against Nirmathas. These heavily armored soldiers don&#146;t train for maneuverability, but rather for immovability. Taking advantage of their weighty armor, Molthuni defenders can hold back an onslaught of enemies intent on breaking through their line. The majority of Molthuni defenders were laborers who joined the military to gain citizenship, though a noteworthy minority are from stouter non-human races.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (including tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Bravery (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a fighter gains a +1 bonus on Will saves against fear. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd.</p>
			<p><b>Armored Defense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a Molthuni defender gains a bonus to his CMD against bull rush, dirty trickAPG, dragAPG, grapple, overrun, repositionAPG, and trip combat maneuver checks. This bonus also applies to the DC of foes&#146; Acrobatics checks to move through squares he threatens. This bonus is +1 when the Molthuni defender is wearing medium armor, and +3 when he is wearing heavy armor. At 7th, 11th, and 15th levels, these bonuses increase by 1.</p>
			<p>In addition to this, the Molthuni defender is able to choose one of the following combat maneuvers: bull rush, dirty trickAPG, dragAPG, grapple, overrun, repositionAPG, or trip. When he is wearing medium or heavy armor, the Molthuni defender adds half his armor training bonus on combat maneuver checks for the selected maneuver. He can choose an additional combat maneuver at 7th, 11th, and 15th levels.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces armor training 1 through 4, but counts as armor training for the purposes of qualifying for feats and prestige classes. It does not count as advanced armor training (see page 14).</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 5th level, a fighter can select one group of weapons, as noted below. Whenever he attacks with a weapon from this group, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls.</p>
			<p>Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), a fighter becomes further trained in another group of weapons. He gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when using a weapon from this group. In addition, the bonuses granted by previous weapon groups increase by +1 each. For example, when a fighter reaches 9th level, he receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with one weapon group and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the weapon group selected at 5th level. Bonuses granted from overlapping groups do not stack. Take the highest bonus granted for a weapon if it resides in two or more groups.</p>
			<p>A fighter also adds this bonus to any combat maneuver checks made with weapons from this group. This bonus also applies to the fighter's Combat Maneuver Defense when defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against weapons from this group.</p>
			<p>Weapon groups are defined as follows (GMs may add other weapons to these groups, or add entirely new groups) -</p>
			<p><b>Armor Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 19th level, a fighter gains DR 5/- whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (&#215;2 becomes &#215;3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Where some fighters focus on strength and raw power, the mobile fighter relies on swiftness and mobility, gliding across the battlefield like a steel whirlwind and leaving destruction in his wake.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (including tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Agility (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a mobile fighter gains a +1 bonus on saving throws made against effects that cause him to become paralyzed, slowed, or entangled. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd. This ability replaces bravery.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. At 7th level, these bonuses increase by +1.</p>
			<p>In addition, a fighter can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 7th level, a fighter can move at his normal speed while wearing heavy armor.</p>
			<p><b>Leaping Attack (Ex): </b>At 5th level, when a mobile fighter moves at least 5 feet prior to attacking, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 5th. This ability replaces weapon training 1, 2, 3, and 4.</p>
			<p><b>Rapid Attack (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a mobile fighter can combine a full attack action with a single move. He must forgo the attack at his highest bonus but may take the remaining attacks at any point during his movement. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. This ability replaces armor training 3.</p>
			<p><b>Fleet Footed (Ex): </b>At 15th level, the mobile fighter&#146;s speed increases by 10 feet. He can take 10 on Acrobatics checks even while distracted or threatened, and can take 20 on an Acrobatics check once per day for every five fighter levels he possesses. This ability replaces armor training 4.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 19th level, a fighter gains DR 5/- whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.</p>
			<p><b>Whirlwind Blitz (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a mobile fighter can make a full-attack action as a standard action. He may also use the Whirlwind Attack feat as a standard action. This ability replaces weapon mastery.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>There are those who learn the fighting arts though countless hours of repetition and training, while others seem to pick up new stances and forms as if they were born to them.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (including tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Bravery (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a fighter gains a +1 bonus on Will saves against fear. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd.</p>

Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum -4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Quick thinking and deception can often carry the day where raw force might not. Lore wardens are the bodyguards, guardians, and soldiers of the Pathfinder Society. Not only are they often called upon to protect and watch over important repositories of lore, but they themselves are impressive keepers of all manner of knowledge. Lore wardens are fighters who benefit from learning to outsmart and outmaneuver their foes rather than just overpower them. Even out of combat, lore wardens have a quick wit and a surprising breadth of knowledge that can often grant them significant advantages over enemies even before a battle begins. Indeed, for many lore wardens, a fight that can be won without a single weapon being drawn is the best kind of victory. A lore warden has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Scholastic (Ex): </b>Lore wardens gain 2 additional skill ranks each level. These ranks must be spent on Intelligence-based skills. All Intelligence-based skills are class skills for lore wardens. This ability replaces the lore warden&#146;s proficiency with medium armor, heavy armor, and shields.</p>
			<p><b>Expertise (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a lore warden gains Combat Expertise as a bonus feat, even if he would not normally qualify for this feat. This ability replaces bravery 1.</p>

He gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when using a weapon from this group. In addition, the bonuses granted by previous weapon groups increase by +1 each. For example, when a fighter reaches 9th level, he receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with one weapon group and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the weapon group selected at 5th level. Bonuses granted from overlapping groups do not stack. Take the highest bonus granted for a weapon if it resides in two or more groups.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Quick wits and deceptive techniques can often succeed where brute force might not. A lore warden is the consummate warrior-scholar of the Pathfinder Society, outsmarting her competition even when locking blades with powerful foes. Outside of combat, a lore warden&#146;s extensive education also helps her document the past and survive great danger.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (including tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Skill Over Strength (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a lore warden qualifies for feats and other abilities as though she had the Combat Expertise feat. At 6th level, she gains Combat Expertise as a bonus feat, even if she would not normally qualify for the feat. If she already has Combat Expertise, she instead gains any one combat feat that includes Combat Expertise as a prerequisite (and for which she otherwise qualifies). At 10th level, she can treat her base attack bonus as though it were 2 higher for the purpose of calculating the effects of Combat Expertise.</p>
			<p><b>Swords Secret (Ex): </b>A lore warden learns specialized techniques that help her to quickly analyze and defeat her foes. At 3rd level, a lore warden gains one swords secret, and she gains an additional swords secret for every 4 fighter levels gained after 3rd. Except where noted, a lore warden cannot select the same swords secret more than once.</p>
			<p><i>Exploit Weakness (Ex): </i>The lore warden adds one-third her class level on attack rolls to confirm critical hits. At 11th level, whenever she confirms a critical hit, her weapon attacks ignore the first 5 points of damage reduction or hardness the target has until the end of her next turn. At 19th level, the lore warden can automatically confirm a critical hit once per round when she threatens a critical hit.</p>
			<p><i>Hair&#146;s Breadth (Ex): </i>Once per day when subject to a critical hit, the lore warden can attempt an Acrobatics check to reduce the damage as an immediate action. If the result of this Acrobatics check is greater than the opponent&#146;s confirmation roll, she negates the critical hit; the attack still hits and deals normal damage. The lore warden must be at least 11th level to select this swords secret. At 15th level she can use this secret one additional time per day.</p>
			<p><i>Know Thy Enemy (Ex): </i>When the lore warden succeeds at a Knowledge check to identify a creature&#146;s abilities and weaknesses, she can also use a standard action to grant herself a +2 insight bonus on all attack and weapon damage rolls made against that enemy. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to half her class level (minimum 2 rounds), or until the lore warden uses this ability against a different creature. At 11th level, she also gains a +2 bonus to her AC against the creature when using this ability. At 19th level, the insight bonus increases to +3.</p>
			<p><i>Maneuver Training (Ex): </i>The lore warden gains a brawler&#146;s maneuver training class feature, treating her fighter level as her brawler level.</p>
			<p><i>Swift Assessment (Ex): </i>The lore warden can now use her know thy enemy swords secret as a move action. At 15th level, she can use this ability as a swift action. She must have the know thy enemy swords secret before choosing this swords secret.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 5th level, a fighter can select one group of weapons, as noted below. Whenever he attacks with a weapon from this group, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls.</p>
			<p>Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), a fighter becomes further trained in another group of weapons. He gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when using a weapon from this group. In addition, the bonuses granted by previous weapon groups increase by +1 each. For example, when a fighter reaches 9th level, he receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with one weapon group and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the weapon group selected at 5th level. Bonuses granted from overlapping groups do not stack. Take the highest bonus granted for a weapon if it resides in two or more groups.</p>
			<p>A fighter also adds this bonus to any combat maneuver checks made with weapons from this group. This bonus also applies to the fighter's Combat Maneuver Defense when defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against weapons from this group.</p>
			<p>Weapon groups are defined as follows (GMs may add other weapons to these groups, or add entirely new groups) -</p>
			<p><b>Armor Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 19th level, a fighter gains DR 5/- whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (&#215;2 becomes &#215;3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>As the shield that protects his lord from the myriad dangers around every corner, the high guardian pledges his life to keep his charge safe. High guardians epitomize personal devotion, making them especially popular among Taldan nobles envious of the emperor&#146;s Ulfen Guard, as well as in the courts of the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, the war councils of Molthune and Lastwall, and the refined chambers of Osirion.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

If he takes this step, he cannot take a 5-foot step during his next turn and his total movement is reduced by 5 feet during his next turn.</p>
			<p><b>Defender&#146;s Reflexes (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a high guardian gains Combat Reflexes as a bonus feat, and he can use his Strength modifier instead of his Dexterity modifier to determine the number of additional attacks of opportunity he can make per round. If he already has Combat Reflexes, he instead gains Stand Still as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Unassailable Allegiance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a high guardian gains a +1 bonus on Will saves against compulsion spells and effects. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 fighter levels beyond 2nd.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum -4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed.</p>
			<p>In addition, a fighter can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 7th level, a fighter can move at his normal speed while wearing heavy armor.</p>
			<p><b>Royal Protector (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a high guardian gains Bodyguard and In Harm&#146;s Way as bonus feats, though he can use them only to improve his obligation&#146;s AC or intercept a successful attack against his obligation.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 5th level, a fighter can select one group of weapons, as noted below. Whenever he attacks with a weapon from this group, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls.</p>
			<p>Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), a fighter becomes further trained in another group of weapons. He gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when using a weapon from this group. In addition, the bonuses granted by previous weapon groups increase by +1 each. For example, when a fighter reaches 9th level, he receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with one weapon group and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the weapon group selected at 5th level. Bonuses granted from overlapping groups do not stack. Take the highest bonus granted for a weapon if it resides in two or more groups.</p>
			<p>A fighter also adds this bonus to any combat maneuver checks made with weapons from this group. This bonus also applies to the fighter's Combat Maneuver Defense when defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against weapons from this group.</p>
			<p>Weapon groups are defined as follows (GMs may add other weapons to these groups, or add entirely new groups) -</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat: </b>At 6th level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 6th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 19th level, a fighter gains DR 5/- whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (&#215;2 becomes &#215;3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.</p>

If a gloomblade creates only one weapon, it gains a weapon special ability of his choice (chosen upon creation); the ability must be valid for the shadow weapon&#146;s weapon type and must be chosen from defending, flaming, frost, keen, ghost touch, merciful, shock, thundering, or vicious. (Additional special abilities might qualify, at the GM&#146;s discretion.)</p>
					<p>At 11th level, a gloomblade&#146;s shadow weapons each gain their full enhancement bonus if he creates two weapons. If a gloomblade creates only one shadow weapon, it gains additional weapon special abilities; the total effective bonus of these abilities cannot exceed +3. The gloomblade can now choose from the of anarchic, axiomatic, flaming burst, icy burst, holy, shocking burst, unholy, and wounding weapon special abilities as well as those from the list above.</p>
					<p>At 15th level, a gloomblade&#146;s shadow weapons each gain magic weapon special abilities with a total effective bonus of +2 per weapon. If a gloomblade creates only one shadow weapon, its magic weapon special abilities cannot exceed a total effective bonus of +5. The gloomblade adds brilliant energy, dancing, and speed to the options he can choose as weapon special abilities for his shadow weapon.</p>
					<p>This replaces the fighter&#146;s armor training and proficiency with heavy armor and shields (he retains proficiency in light and medium armor).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The Shadow Plane&#146;s substance is legendary for its versatility. In shadow-shrouded lands, secretive martial practitioners long ago learned to shape supernatural weapons from ribbons of pure darkness.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Craft (Int), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Perception (Wis), Stealth (Dex), and Survival (Wis).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light and medium armor.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Bravery (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a fighter gains a +1 bonus on Will saves against fear. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd.</p>
			<p><b>Shadow Weapon (Su): </b>A gloomblade can create a shadowy weapon in a free hand as a move action. This can take the form of any melee weapon with which he is proficient. A gloomblade can have only one shadow weapon in existence at a time; creating a new shadow weapon causes an existing shadow weapon to vanish. At 3rd level, the shadow weapon acts as a magic weapon with a +1 enhancement bonus; this bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels a gloomblade has beyond 2nd, to a maximum enhancement bonus of +5 at 18th level.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a gloomblade can create (and maintain) two shadow weapons at a time as a move action; if he does, each weapon has an enhancement bonus 1 lower than normal. If a gloomblade creates only one weapon, it gains a weapon special ability of his choice (chosen upon creation); the ability must be valid for the shadow weapon&#146;s weapon type and must be chosen from defending, flaming, frost, keen, ghost touch, merciful, shock, thundering, or vicious. (Additional special abilities might qualify, at the GM&#146;s discretion.)</p>
			<p>At 11th level, a gloomblade&#146;s shadow weapons each gain their full enhancement bonus if he creates two weapons. If a gloomblade creates only one shadow weapon, it gains additional weapon special abilities; the total effective bonus of these abilities cannot exceed +3. The gloomblade can now choose from the of anarchic, axiomatic, flaming burst, icy burst, holy, shocking burst, unholy, and wounding weapon special abilities as well as those from the list above.</p>
			<p>At 15th level, a gloomblade&#146;s shadow weapons each gain magic weapon special abilities with a total effective bonus of +2 per weapon. If a gloomblade creates only one shadow weapon, its magic weapon special abilities cannot exceed a total effective bonus of +5. The gloomblade adds brilliant energy, dancing, and speed to the options he can choose as weapon special abilities for his shadow weapon.</p>
			<p><b>Shadow Weapon Training (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a gloomblade gains weapon training, except that he does not select a weapon group; instead, the bonus applies to the shadow weapons he creates. A gloomblade does not select additional weapon groups as he gains levels.</p>
			<p>At 9th level, whenever a gloomblade creates one or more shadow weapons, he can apply any one of the following shadow effects (chosen upon creation) to one of them.</p>
			<list>
				<li>During the gloomblade&#146;s turn, he can increase his reach with that weapon by 5 feet.</li>
				<li>The gloomblade can increase a thrown shadow weapon&#146;s range increment (if any) by 20 feet.</li>
				<li>When he hits a foe with a melee attack with the weapon, he can use it to perform a reposition combat maneuver against the creature hit as a swift action. This does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</li>
				<li>Attacks made with the weapon ignore hardness equal to or less than the gloomblade&#146;s fighter level.</li>
			</list>
			<p>For every 4 levels he has beyond 9th, a gloomblade can apply an additional effect to his shadow weapons, to a maximum of three effects at 17th level; these effects can be split between multiple shadow weapons as a gloomblade desires, but they don&#146;t stack with themselves.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 19th level, a fighter gains DR 5/- whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (&#215;2 becomes &#215;3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.</p>

					<p>Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Most fighters battle out of necessity, with each battle a contest of life and death. Some, however, fight for glory and for the adulation of the crowd. The gladiator is both a cunning warrior and a consummate performer, knowing life and death are balanced not only on a sword&#146;s edge, but also on the cheers or jeers of the crowd.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A gladiator is not proficient with heavy armor or tower shields. Instead he gains the Performance Weapon Mastery feat at 1st level as a bonus feat. This bonus feat is in addition to the bonus feat a fighter gains at 1st level. Furthermore, a gladiator using piecemeal armor is considered to be wearing a suit of armor as long as he wearing two or three armor pieces, gaining the +1 to armor bonus but still taking the +5% chance of arcane spell failure if the pieces are mixed.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p>A gladiator may choose to take combat or performance feats as bonus feats.</p>
			<p><b>Fame (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, when a gladiator begins a performance combat, he always starts with at least 1 victory point. If he already has victory points, he gains 1 extra victory point. At 10th level, the gladiator starts out with at least 2 victory points. If he already has victory points, he gains 2 extra victory points. This ability replaces bravery.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum -4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed.</p>
			<p>In addition, a fighter can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 7th level, a fighter can move at his normal speed while wearing heavy armor.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 5th level, a fighter can select one group of weapons, as noted below. Whenever he attacks with a weapon from this group, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls.</p>
			<p>Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), a fighter becomes further trained in another group of weapons. He gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when using a weapon from this group. In addition, the bonuses granted by previous weapon groups increase by +1 each. For example, when a fighter reaches 9th level, he receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with one weapon group and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the weapon group selected at 5th level. Bonuses granted from overlapping groups do not stack. Take the highest bonus granted for a weapon if it resides in two or more groups.</p>
			<p>A fighter also adds this bonus to any combat maneuver checks made with weapons from this group. This bonus also applies to the fighter's Combat Maneuver Defense when defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against weapons from this group.</p>
			<p>Weapon groups are defined as follows (GMs may add other weapons to these groups, or add entirely new groups) -</p>
			<p><b>Armor Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 19th level, a fighter gains DR 5/- whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (&#215;2 becomes &#215;3, for example).

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The free hand fighter specializes in the delicate art of handling a single weapon in one hand while using his free hand to balance, block, tip, and distract his opponents. While not a brawler, his open hand is as much a weapon as a bow or blade. His fighting school benefits only apply when he is using a one-handed weapon and carrying nothing in his other hand.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>While the axe is the most famous dwarven weapon, the hammer is at the heart of dwarves&#146; heritage as forgemasters and warriors alike.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Race: </b>Dwarf Only</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Eldritch guardians are trained to detect and give warning about magic threats to the people and places they protect.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Perception(Wis), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Survival (Wis), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (including tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Familiar (Ex): </b>At 1st level, an eldritch guardian gains a familiar, treating his fighter level as his effective wizard level for the purpose of this ability. This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 1st level.</p>
			<p><b>Share Training (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, when the familiar can see and hear its master, it can use any combat feat possessed by the eldritch guardian. The familiar doesn&#146;t have to meet the feat&#146;s prerequisites, but at the GM&#146;s discretion may be precluded from using certain combat feats due to its physical form. For example, an eldritch guardian&#146;s pig familiar with access to Exotic Weapon Proficiency (spiked chain) would not gain the ability to use spiked chains, since it doesn&#146;t have any limbs capable of properly handling them. This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Steel Will (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, the eldritch guardian gains a +1 bonus on Will saves against fear and mind-affecting effects. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels beyond 2nd. This ability replaces bravery.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum -4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed.</p>
			<p>In addition, a fighter can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 7th level, a fighter can move at his normal speed while wearing heavy armor.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat: </b>At 4th level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 5th level, a fighter can select one group of weapons, as noted below. Whenever he attacks with a weapon from this group, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls.</p>
			<p>Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), a fighter becomes further trained in another group of weapons. He gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when using a weapon from this group. In addition, the bonuses granted by previous weapon groups increase by +1 each. For example, when a fighter reaches 9th level, he receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with one weapon group and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the weapon group selected at 5th level. Bonuses granted from overlapping groups do not stack. Take the highest bonus granted for a weapon if it resides in two or more groups.</p>
			<p>A fighter also adds this bonus to any combat maneuver checks made with weapons from this group. This bonus also applies to the fighter's Combat Maneuver Defense when defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against weapons from this group.</p>
			<p>Weapon groups are defined as follows (GMs may add other weapons to these groups, or add entirely new groups) -</p>
			<p><b>Armor Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 19th level, a fighter gains DR 5/- whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (&#215;2 becomes &#215;3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.</p>

For a number of hours equal to the class level of the highest-level Blackjacket, the participants each gain the benefits of the selected feat even if they do not meet the feat&#146;s prerequisites. If a creature benefiting from this ability moves more than 30 feet away from any other participant, it loses all benefits of this ability until it is again within 30 feet. Creatures that do not have levels in this archetype can&#146;t benefit from this ability, and no creature can benefit from this ability more than once at any given time.

If only Blackjackets are included in the effect, all Druman Blackjackets affected gain a +1 morale bonus on skill checks and saving throws for the duration of the effect.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Known as the Blackjackets, the elite soldiers of Druma are and always have been mercenaries rather than a standing army. Still, gold buys loyalty, and the Kalistocrats pay best of all. As a result, the Blackjackets are well equipped and dedicate themselves to training in small-unit tactics, quickly communicating strategies and tricks to handle any threat to their charges.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (including tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At varioud levels, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>In addition to combat feats, a Druman Blackjacket can choose Improved Iron Will, Iron Will, or any teamwork feat as bonus feats.</p>
			<p><b>Well-Paid Loyalty (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a Druman Blackjacket gains a +1 bonus on Will saves against compulsion spells, spell-like abilities, and effects. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels the Blackjacket possesses beyond 2nd. This ability replaces bravery.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum -4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed.</p>
			<p>In addition, a fighter can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 7th level, a fighter can move at his normal speed while wearing heavy armor.</p>
			<p><b>Blackjacket Tactics (Ex): </b>At 4th level, two or more Druman Blackjackets can spend 1 minute discussing strategy, then choose a single teamwork feat (Advanced Players Guide 150) possessed by at least one of them. For a number of hours equal to the class level of the highest-level Blackjacket, the participants each gain the benefits of the selected feat even if they do not meet the feat&#146;s prerequisites. If a creature benefiting from this ability moves more than 30 feet away from any other participant, it loses all benefits of this ability until it is again within 30 feet. Creatures that do not have levels in this archetype can&#146;t benefit from this ability, and no creature can benefit from this ability more than once at any given time. This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 4th level.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 5th level, a fighter can select one group of weapons, as noted below. Whenever he attacks with a weapon from this group, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls.</p>
			<p>Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), a fighter becomes further trained in another group of weapons. He gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when using a weapon from this group. In addition, the bonuses granted by previous weapon groups increase by +1 each. For example, when a fighter reaches 9th level, he receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with one weapon group and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the weapon group selected at 5th level. Bonuses granted from overlapping groups do not stack. Take the highest bonus granted for a weapon if it resides in two or more groups.</p>
			<p>A fighter also adds this bonus to any combat maneuver checks made with weapons from this group. This bonus also applies to the fighter's Combat Maneuver Defense when defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against weapons from this group.</p>
			<p>Weapon groups are defined as follows (GMs may add other weapons to these groups, or add entirely new groups) -</p>
			<p><b>Amateurs! (Ex): </b>At 8th level, when using the Blackjacket tactics ability, a Druman Blackjacket can include one or more creatures without levels in this archetype, but doing so reduces the duration of the effect to a number of minutes equal to the class level of the highest-level Blackjacket instead of a number of hours per level. If only Blackjackets are included in the effect, all Druman Blackjackets affected gain a +1 morale bonus on skill checks and saving throws for the duration of the effect. This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 8th level.</p>
			<p><b>Superior Tactics (Ex): </b>At 12th level, a Druman Blackjacket who uses the Blackjacket tactics ability can allow all affected Blackjackets to gain a second bonus teamwork feat possessed by at least one of the participants. This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 12th level.</p>
			<p><b>Esprit de Corps (Ex): </b>At 16th level, a Druman Blackjacket grants all Blackjackets with whom he is sharing one or more teamwork feats through the Blackjacket tactics ability a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws. Each affected Blackjacket increases this bonus by 1 if another affected Blackjacket has been reduced to 0 or fewer hit points since the beginning of his last turn. This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 16th level.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 19th level, a fighter gains DR 5/- whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (&#215;2 becomes &#215;3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Drill sergeants excel at training other combatants in fighting techniques.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>These gallant lancers serve in the vanguard of many armies or as knights-errant. They are born leaders and masters of the mounted charge.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (excluding tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Skilled Rider (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a dragoon gains both the Mounted Combat and Skill Focus (Ride) feats as bonus feats. This ability replaces the 1st-level fighter bonus combat feat.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 2nd level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Bravery (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a fighter gains a +1 bonus on Will saves against fear. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1.</p>
			<p>In addition, a fighter can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor.</p>
			<p><b>Spear Training (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a dragoon must select weapon training with the spear group. The dragoon&#146;s weapon training bonus with spears improves by +1 on attack rolls and +2 on damage rolls for every four levels beyond 5th (to a maximum of +4 on attack rolls and +8 on damage rolls at 17th level). The dragoon does not gain weapon training in any other groups as he increases in level.</p>
			<p><b>Spinning Lance (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a dragoon may alternate attacks with the piercing head of his lance with reach, or with the butt end (treat as a club) against adjacent targets. Unlike a double weapon, the masterwork quality and magical special abilities apply to both ends of the lance, except for those weapon special abilities that apply only to edged weapons. This ability replaces armor training 2.</p>
			<p><b>Banner (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a dragoon may attach a banner to his lance. This is identical to the cavalier class feature. The bonuses provided by the dragoon&#146;s banner increase by +1 for every five levels beyond 9th (to a maximum of +3 at 19th level). Cavalier levels stack with his dragoon level for determining the effect of his banner, and he can take the better banner progression. This ability replaces weapon training 2, 3, and 4.</p>
			<p><b>Piercing Lance (Ex): </b>At 11th level, as a standard action or as part of a charge, a dragoon attacking a mounted opponent can make two attacks, one against the mount and the other against the rider, using his highest base attack bonus.

When charging, a dragoon may jump from his mount toward his target.

			<p><b>Armor Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 19th level, a fighter gains DR 5/- whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a dragoon must select the lance for this ability.. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (&#215;2 becomes &#215;3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Dragonheir scions are the martially inclined humanoid descendants of those influenced by draconic power. Unlike their sorcerous brethren, dragonheir scions manifest their heritage in ways more suited to strength of arms and skill with steel than arcane energies. Those who follow this path are often the children of mighty dragon-blooded sorcerers and others who drew energy from their dragon blood, though they themselves might not exhibit spellcasting ability.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (including tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Draconic Bloodline (Su): </b>Each dragonheir scion can draw her lineage back to the influence of a great draconic progenitor. At 1st level, a dragonheir scion must select one of the chromatic or metallic dragon types. Once chosen, this cannot be changed. A number of dragonheir scion&#146;s abilities deal damage and grant resistances based on her dragon type, as noted below. If a dragonheir scion takes a level in another class that grants a bloodline, the bloodlines must be of the same type, even if that means that the bloodline of one of the classes must change. Subject to GM discretion, the dragonheir scion can change her former bloodline to make them conform.</p>

			<p><b>Eldritch Strikes (Su): </b>At 1st level, a dragonheir scion gains Arcane Strike as a bonus feat. She does not need to meet its prerequisites.</p>
			<p><b>Fearful Might (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a dragonheir scion gains a +1 bonus on Intimidate checks to demoralize a foe. This bonus increases to +2 at 6th level and by an additional 1 every 4 fighter levels thereafter to a maximum of +5 at 18th level.</p>
			<p><b>Draconic Defense (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a dragonheir scion gains a +1 natural armor bonus and energy resistance 5 against her energy type. At 7th level, this increases to a +2 natural armor bonus and energy resistance 10; at 13th level, it increases to a +3 natural armor bonus and energy resistance 20.</p>
			<p><b>Draconic Strike (Su): </b>At 4th level, whenever the dragonheir scion damages a target with an attack augmented by Arcane Strike, the attack deals an additional 1d4 points of damage of the dragonheir scion&#146;s energy type.</p>
			<p>Bonus Feat: At 2nd level then at 8th level and every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 5th level, a fighter can select one group of weapons, as noted below. Whenever he attacks with a weapon from this group, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls.</p>
			<p>Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), a fighter becomes further trained in another group of weapons. He gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when using a weapon from this group. In addition, the bonuses granted by previous weapon groups increase by +1 each. For example, when a fighter reaches 9th level, he receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with one weapon group and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the weapon group selected at 5th level. Bonuses granted from overlapping groups do not stack. Take the highest bonus granted for a weapon if it resides in two or more groups.</p>
			<p>A fighter also adds this bonus to any combat maneuver checks made with weapons from this group. This bonus also applies to the fighter's Combat Maneuver Defense when defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against weapons from this group.</p>
			<p>Weapon groups are defined as follows (GMs may add other weapons to these groups, or add entirely new groups) -</p>
			<p><b>Draconic Presense (Su): </b>At 6th level, the dragonheir scion receives Dazzling Display as a bonus feat. She does not need a weapon in hand to use this ability, and can use it as a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>Wings (Su): </b>At 15th level, a dragonheir scion can grow leathery dragon wings from her back as a standard action, granting her a fly speed of 60 feet with average maneuverability. She can dismiss the wings as a free action.</p>
			<p><b>Might of Wyrms (Su): </b>At 20th level, a dragonheir scion&#146;s draconic heritage becomes manifest. She gains immunity to paralysis, sleep, and damage of her energy type, as well as blindsense with a range of 60 feet.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The dirty fighter laughs at concepts like honor and fair play. He cares only for victory, no matter how he achieves it, and spends as much time mastering sneaky combat maneuvers as he does drilling with weapons or learning how to wear armor. A dirty fighter has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Race: </b>Orc Only</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (including tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Sidestep (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a dirty fighter learns how to evade his enemies when they react to his combat maneuvers. He gains a +1 dodge bonus to his AC against attacks of opportunity provoked by him while attempting a combat maneuver. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd level. This ability replaces bravery.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum -4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed.</p>
			<p>In addition, a fighter can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 7th level, a fighter can move at his normal speed while wearing heavy armor.</p>
			<p><b>Maneuver Training (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a dirty fighter becomes a master of dirty tricks. He gains a +2 bonus on dirty trick combat maneuver checks and +2 to his CMD when he is the target of a dirty trick combat maneuver. This ability replaces weapon training 1.</p>
			<p><b>Speedy Tricks (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a dirty fighter has perfected how to quickly perform dirty tricks. He can make a dirty trick combat maneuver as an attack instead of a standard action. This ability replaces weapon training 2.</p>
			<p><b>Double Tricks (Ex): </b>At 13th level, when a dirty fighter performs a combat maneuver, he may apply two different conditions to his target instead of one. Each penalty condition requires a separate action to remove. At 17th level, he may apply three different conditions. This ability replaces weapon training 3 and 4.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 19th level, a fighter gains DR 5/- whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (&#215;2 becomes &#215;3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Cyber-soldiers replace fallible flesh with precisioncrafted machinery. Some seek to exceed the limitations of humanoid flesh, while others become cyber-soldiers through drastic repairs necessitated by horrific injuries. A cyber-soldier has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (including tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Bravery (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a fighter gains a +1 bonus on Will saves against fear. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. At 7th level these bonuses increase by +1.</p>
			<p>In addition, a fighter can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 13th level, a fighter can move at his normal speed while wearing heavy armor.</p>
			<p><b>Cybernetic Combat (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a cyber-soldier gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls with implanted weapons, cybernetic arms, and melee or thrown weapons wielded with a cybernetic arm. Weapons wielded with two cybernetic arms receive double the bonus, except when such weapons are thrown. This damage bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels gained. This attack bonus does not stack with the attack bonus for weapon training. A cyber-soldier gains a slam attack for each cybernetic arm. These attacks deal 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage for a Medium cyber-soldier and 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage for a Small cybersoldier. This ability replaces weapon training 1.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 9th level, a fighter can select one group of weapons, as noted below. Whenever he attacks with a weapon from this group, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls.</p>
			<p>Every four levels thereafter (13th, and 17th), a fighter becomes further trained in another group of weapons. He gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when using a weapon from this group. In addition, the bonuses granted by previous weapon groups increase by +1 each. For example, when a fighter reaches 13th level, he receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with one weapon group and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the weapon group selected at 9th level. Bonuses granted from overlapping groups do not stack. Take the highest bonus granted for a weapon if it resides in two or more groups.</p>
			<p>A fighter also adds this bonus to any combat maneuver checks made with weapons from this group. This bonus also applies to the fighter's Combat Maneuver Defense when defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against weapons from this group.</p>
			<p>Weapon groups are defined as follows (GMs may add other weapons to these groups, or add entirely new groups) -</p>
			<p><b>Improved Implantation (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a cybersoldier can exceed the normal limitations on cybertech implantation. Her brain and body slots each accommodate one more piece of cybertech than normal. In addition, her limit on implantation points increases by 1/2 his cybersoldier level. She can allocate these points between his Intelligence and Constitution scores as she chooses. At 15th level, her body slot can accommodate two more pieces of cybertech than normal. This ability replaces armor training 2 and 4.</p>
			<p><b>Resilience (Ex): </b>At 19th level, a cyber-soldier has a reservoir of 5 temporary hit points for each piece of implanted cybertech in his body. Lost temporary hit points are recovered at the rate of 10 points per hour. This ability replaces armor mastery.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (&#215;2 becomes &#215;3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The crossbowman has perfected the deadly use of the crossbow, a simple but cruelly efficient weapon, as a craftsman mastering a lethal tool.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (including tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Bravery (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a fighter gains a +1 bonus on Will saves against fear. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd.</p>
			<p><b>Deadshot (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, when a crossbowman attacks with a crossbow as a readied action, he may add 1/2 his Dexterity bonus (minimum +1) on his damage roll. This ability replaces armor training 1.</p>
			<p><b>Crossbow Expert (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a crossbowman gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with crossbows. This bonus increases by +1 per four levels after 5th. This ability replaces weapon training 1.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Deadshot (Ex): </b>At 7th level, when a crossbowman attacks with a crossbow as a readied action, his target is denied its Dexterity bonus to its AC. This ability replaces armor training 2.</p>
			<p><b>Quick Sniper (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a crossbowman gains a bonus equal to 1/2 his fighter level on Stealth checks when sniping. When he is hit with a ranged attack, he can shoot his crossbow at his attacker as an immediate action if it is loaded. This ability replaces weapon training 2.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Deadshot (Ex): </b>At 11th level, when a crossbowman attacks with a crossbow as a readied action, he may add his Dexterity bonus (minimum +1) on his damage roll. This ability replaces armor training 3.</p>
			<p><b>Safe Shot (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a crossbowman does not provoke attacks of opportunity when making ranged attacks with a crossbow. This ability replaces weapon training 3.</p>
			<p><b>Pinpoint Targeting: </b>At 15th level, a crossbowman gains Pinpoint Targeting as a bonus feat. This ability replaces armor training 4.</p>
			<p><b>Meteor Shot (Ex): </b>At 17th level, as a standard action, a crossbowman can make one attack with a crossbow at a &#150;4 penalty. If the attack hits, it inflicts damage normally and the target is subject to a bull rush or a trip maneuver using the attack roll as the combat maneuver check. The crossbowman must decide which maneuver to attempt before making his attack roll. This ability replaces weapon training 4.</p>
			<p><b>Penetrating Shot (Ex): </b>At 19th level, when a crossbowman confirms a critical hit with a crossbow, the bolt pierces the target and can strike another creature in line behind it. The crossbowman must be able to trace a line starting at his space and passing through both targets to make this additional attack. The secondary attack is made at a &#150;4 penalty, in addition to any modifiers for added range. If this attack is also a critical hit, the bolt can continue to hit another target, but the penalties stack. This ability replaces armor mastery.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a crossbowman must choose a type of crossbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (&#215;2 becomes &#215;3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A corsair is a pirate who focuses on shipboard combat, relying on his strength of arms over his agility. He specializes in traditional pirate weapons, but often wears heavier armor than is normally seen on a ship. A corsair moves and fights easily in his armor, however, even in the water. Captains value corsairs because of the skill they exhibit in defending the ship and in boarding actions.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (including tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Pirate Weapons (Ex): </b>A corsair is well versed in the types of weapons favored by pirates. When selecting a group of weapons for his Weapon Training ability, he can select Pirate Weapons as a group. The Pirate Weapons group consists of the crossbow, cutlass, dagger, hook hand, rapier, and short sword.</p>
			<p><b>Deck Fighting (Ex): </b>A corsair is used to fighting on crowded decks, and isn&#146;t fazed by fighting multiple opponents at once. At 2nd level, he gains Cleave as a bonus feat. He may use this feat even if he does not meet the prerequisites. A corsair does not take the normal &#150;2 penalty to his AC when using the Cleave feat. This ability replaces the fighter&#146;s 2nd-level bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter (with the execption of 2nd and 6th levels), a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Bravery (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a fighter gains a +1 bonus on Will saves against fear. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd.</p>
			<p><b>Armored Pirate (Ex): </b>A corsair wears heavier armor than is common aboard a ship. At 3rd level, the corsair reduces the armor check penalty of any light armor he wears to 0 for purposes of Acrobatics and Swim checks. At 7th level, this becomes true of medium armor as well. At 11th level, it includes heavy armor. This ability replaces armor training.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 5th level, a fighter can select one group of weapons, as noted below. Whenever he attacks with a weapon from this group, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls.</p>
			<p>Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), a fighter becomes further trained in another group of weapons. He gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when using a weapon from this group. In addition, the bonuses granted by previous weapon groups increase by +1 each. For example, when a fighter reaches 9th level, he receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with one weapon group and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the weapon group selected at 5th level. Bonuses granted from overlapping groups do not stack. Take the highest bonus granted for a weapon if it resides in two or more groups.</p>
			<p>A fighter also adds this bonus to any combat maneuver checks made with weapons from this group. This bonus also applies to the fighter's Combat Maneuver Defense when defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against weapons from this group.</p>
			<p>Weapon groups are defined as follows (GMs may add other weapons to these groups, or add entirely new groups) -</p>
			<p><b>Improved Deck Fighting (Ex): </b>At 6th level, the corsair gains Great Cleave as a bonus feat. He may use this feat even if he does not meet the prerequisites. A corsair does not take the normal &#150;2 penalty to his AC when using the Great Cleave feat. This ability replaces the fighter&#146;s 6th-level bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 19th level, a fighter gains DR 5/- whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (&#215;2 becomes &#215;3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.</p>

					<p>The child of Acavna and Amaznen gains a spellbook containing 4 0-level wizard spells of her choice. She can prepare and cast these spells as a wizard, using her fighter level as her caster level. She can prepare a number of 0-level spells each day equal to 1 + 1 per 6 fighter levels.</p>

					<p>A fighter also adds this bonus to any combat maneuver checks made with weapons from this group. This bonus also applies to the fighter's Combat Maneuver Defense when defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against weapons from this group.</p>
					<p>Weapon groups are defined as follows (GMs may add other weapons to these groups, or add entirely new groups):</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The child of Acavna and Amaznen has trained in the nearly forgotten arts of Azlant passed down by Aroden, which combine martial prowess with elementary wizardry. Inspired by the deities Aroden once worshiped long ago, children of Acavna and Amaznen strive to understand the dangers of the world and overcome them with knowledge and strength of arms.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons (execpt two-handed martial weapons) and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (excluding tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Eldritch Lore: </b>A child of Acavna and Amaznen gains 4 skill ranks + a number of skill ranks equal to her Intelligence modifier at each level, instead of the normal 2 skill ranks + her Intelligence modifier at each level. Furthermore, Knowledge (arcana, religion), Linguistics, and Spellcraft are all class skills for the child of Acavna and Amaznen. This alters the fighter&#146;s skills and replaces the bonus fighter combat feat gained at 1st level.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Bravery (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a fighter gains a +1 bonus on Will saves against fear. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd.</p>
			<p><b>Lore of Acavna and Amaznen (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a child of Acavna and Amaznen is further initiated into the arcane secrets passed down from Azlant. This gives her minor spellcasting abilities and access to lore collected to give her an edge against the enemies of humanity.</p>
			<p>The child of Acavna and Amaznen gains a spellbook containing 4 0-level wizard spells of her choice. She can prepare and cast these spells as a wizard, using her fighter level as her caster level. She can prepare a number of 0-level spells each day equal to 1 + 1 per 6 fighter levels.</p>
			<p>She also gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge checks relating to Azlant and the Azlanti, and on Knowledge checks to identify and learn the powers and weaknesses of aboleths, demons, serpentfolk, and undead.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum -4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed.</p>
			<p>In addition, a fighter can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 7th level, a fighter can move at his normal speed while wearing heavy armor.</p>
			<p><b>Eldritch Armor Training (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a child of Acavna and Amaznen gains eldritch armor training. This functions as armor training, except as a swift action she can also reduce the arcane spell failure chance due to armor she is wearing by 15% for any spells she casts this round. This reduction increases to 20% at 7th level, 25% at 11th level, and 30% at 15th level. In addition, if she has Arcane Armor Training or Arcane Armor Mastery, rather than having their normal effects, each of those feats increases the arcane spell failure reduction of her eldritch armor training by 10%. This ability modifies armor training.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>Starting at 5th level, the spellcasting ability of a child of Acavna and Amaznen increases to allow her to cast a limited number of spells drawn from the bloodrager spell list (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide 22). She automatically adds to her spellbook a number of 1st-level bloodrager spells equal to 3 + her Intelligence modifier. Her caster level for these spells is equal to her fighter level, and the bloodrager class spell list is considered to be her class spell list for the purposes of meeting prerequisites and using magic items.</p>
			<p>She uses the ranger&#146;s spells per day, but uses her Intelligence score to determine her bonus spells and spell saving throw DCs, just as a wizard does. She does not gain any other wizard abilities, such as an arcane bond or school. Each time she attains a new fighter level, she gains one bloodrager spell of her choice to add to her spellbook. The free spells must be of spell levels she can cast. She otherwise follows the rules for a wizard regarding her spellbook and learning or preparing spells.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 5th level, a fighter can select one group of weapons, as noted below. Whenever he attacks with a weapon from this group, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls.</p>
			<p>Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), a fighter becomes further trained in another group of weapons. He gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when using a weapon from this group. In addition, the bonuses granted by previous weapon groups increase by +1 each. For example, when a fighter reaches 9th level, he receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with one weapon group and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the weapon group selected at 5th level. Bonuses granted from overlapping groups do not stack. Take the highest bonus granted for a weapon if it resides in two or more groups.</p>
			<p>A fighter also adds this bonus to any combat maneuver checks made with weapons from this group. This bonus also applies to the fighter's Combat Maneuver Defense when defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against weapons from this group.</p>
			<p>Weapon groups are defined as follows (GMs may add other weapons to these groups, or add entirely new groups) -</p>

			<p><b>Weapon Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (&#215;2 becomes &#215;3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Perfectly at home in the darkness, the cavern sniper capitalizes on stealth and ranged attacks imbued with his spell-like abilities to harass his opponents. The cavern sniper focuses on surprise, his innate magical abilities, and poison to take down unwary foes. The cavern sniper has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (including tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Imbued Shot (Su): </b>At 1st level, the cavern sniper gains the ability to imbue his arrows or bolts with the effect of one of his drow faerie fire, darkness, or deeper darkness spell-like abilities (provided he has access to the ability) as a swift action. When such an arrow or bolt is fired, the spell&#146;s area is centered where the arrow or bolt lands. If the target of the attack has a space larger than 5 feet, the cavern sniper can choose which square of the creature&#146;s space is the center of the spell-like ability&#146;s effect, as long as that square is within line of sight of the cavern sniper. The cavern sniper can instead choose to target a single square within line of sight with an imbued arrow or bolt, and uses that square as the center of the spell-like ability&#146;s area of effect on a hit (AC 5). The arrow must be fired during the round it was imbued, or the spell-like ability is wasted. If the arrow or bolt misses, the use of the spell-like ability is wasted. This ability replaces the 1st-level fighter bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 2nd level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Silent Shooter (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a cavern sniper gains a +2 bonus on Stealth checks made when loading a bow or crossbow, poisoning ammunition, and making sniping attempts. This bonus increases by +2 for every four levels beyond 2nd. This ability replaces bravery.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum -4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed.</p>
			<p>In addition, a fighter can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 7th level, a fighter can move at his normal speed while wearing heavy armor.</p>
			<p><b>Quick and Deadly (Ex): </b>At 4th level, the cavern sniper can move at full speed while using Stealth at no penalty and can apply poison to a single arrow or crossbow bolt as a swift action. This ability replaces the 4th-level fighter bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Sniper Training (Ex): </b>At 5th level, the cavern sniper chooses the bow or crossbow weapon group and gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 5th. This ability replaces weapon training 1, 3, and 4.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Imbued Shot (Su): </b>At 9th level, the cavern sniper gains two extra uses of both his faerie fire and darkness spell-like abilities, but can only use these extra uses to imbue arrows and bolts with the imbued shot class feature. This ability replaces weapon training 2.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 19th level, a fighter gains DR 5/- whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, when the cavern sniper gains weapon mastery, he must choose a weapon in either the bow or crossbow weapon group. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (&#215;2 becomes &#215;3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Not every Calistrian who dedicates himself to the goddess can channel divine magic to track down those who deserve punishment. Like a bounty hunter following his own rules, a Calistrian hunter tracks down elusive prey using his wits and delivers long-overdue retribution while easily ignoring his own injuries thanks to the joy he receives from a job well done.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A Calistrian hunter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, plus the whip. In addition, the hunter is proficient with light and medium armor as well as shields (except tower shields). This replaces the normal fighter armor and weapon proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Tenacious Tracker (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a Calistrian hunter gains a +1 bonus on Diplomacy checks to gather information and on Survival checks made to identify or follow tracks. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels the Calistrian hunter possesses beyond 2nd. This ability replaces bravery.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum -4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed.</p>
			<p>In addition, a fighter can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 7th level, a fighter can move at his normal speed while wearing heavy armor.</p>
			<p><b>Vengeance (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a Calistrian hunter deals 1d4 points of bleed damage when he damages a creature that has damaged him since the beginning of his last turn. Whenever a creature takes bleed damage from this effect, it also takes a &#150;1 penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for 1 round. This penalty is a pain effect and does not stack with the effects of the sickened condition. This bleed damage increases to 1d6 at 9th level, 1d8 at 13th level, and 2d6 at 17th level. This ability replaces weapon training 1.</p>
			<p><b>Savor the Sting (Ex): </b>At 9th level, whenever a target takes bleed damage from a Calistrian hunter&#146;s vengeance ability, the Calistrian hunter gains an equal number of temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute and do not stack with each other. This ability replaces weapon training 2.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Revenge (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a Calistrian hunter gains the quarry class feature; this functions like the ranger ability of the same name, but the target must be one that has damaged the Calistrian hunter in the past hour. This ability replaces weapon training 3.</p>

			<p><b>Certain Revenge (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a Calistrian hunter gains the improved quarry class feature; this functions like the ranger ability of the same name, but the target must have attacked him in the past day.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>In combat, most fighters have some sort of code of honor. Some believe that one should not kick enemies when they are down, or should limit use of other such dirty tricks to the most dire of circumstances. The cad places no such limitations on himself. Battles are for winning, and anything that gives the cad the upper hand against his enemies is a legitimate tactic. No trick is too treacherous if it leads to victory.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Sleight of Hand (Dex), and Stealth (Dex) are class skills for a cad.</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>All melee is up close and personal, but some warriors bring it as close as they can get. Brawlers can be found anywhere, among all races and societies. A brawler could be hired muscle in a tavern, a local crime syndicate enforcer, or a hotheaded recruit among the ranks of a baron&#146;s guard. Often brawlers&#146; in-your-face attitudes are as powerful as their tactics.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>All fighters have two main tools of their trade&#151;weapons and armor. While many fighters hone their weapon skills to a point of inescapable grace and lethality, there are those who live under the maxim that a good offense can be accomplished though an impenetrable defense. To these fighters, proper use of armor and shields ensures that they can fight another day, and that the frustration of enemies who can&#146;t seem to crack an armor master&#146;s superior defenses is just the first symptom of his foes&#146; eventual defeat.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Until would-be Hellknights take the trial referred to simply as the Test&#151;in which they enter single combat with a conjured devil and either emerge victorious or die&#151; they are known as armigers. While this is a blanket term for all Hellknights-in-training (including those training to become signifers), it also applies specifically to fighters who focus their training to become Hellknights. Despite their lack of recognized rank, armigers are skilled and deadly warriors.</i></p>
			<p><i>Most armigers live and train at their order&#146;s citadel, working toward the day when they become full-fledged Hellknights. These armigers follow a brutally strict routine; they spend hours honing their combat skills against other trainees, obsessively studying in the citadel&#146;s libraries, or memorizing passages of the Hellknight philosophy known as the Measure and the Chain. At regular intervals, squads of armigers emerge from their citadels to patrol nearby cities or frontier lands, working to enforce Hellknight law and their order&#146;s edicts.</i></p>
			<p><i>On occasion, some armigers travel farther from their citadels, searching out those who mock the law and bringing them to justice by any means necessary. While a few do so as squires to full-fledged Hellknights, others strike out on their own or join bands of adventurers. To make up for the broken routine of adventuring life and the frequent compromises necessary in the presence of such allies, such roaming armigers are expected to perform frequent reckonings. These painful acts of mortification, such as scourging oneself or drinking boiling water, keep the would-be Hellknight disciplined and focused on the strictures of the Measure and the Chain.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>

			<p><b>Hellknight Order: </b>At 1st level, an armiger must select which Hellknight order she intends to join. If the armiger later gains levels in a Hellknight prestige class, she must select that same order.</p>
			<p><b>Studious Squire: </b>An armiger gains 2 additional skill ranks at each level. These ranks must be put into Intimidate and Knowledge (planes). In addition, the armiger treats Knowledge (local) and Knowledge (planes) as class skills.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 2nd level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p>When selecting fighter bonus feats, the armiger can select any feats whose names include the word &#147;Hellknight&#148; (such as those that appear on page 62 of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Path of the Hellknight) as though they were combat feats.</p>
			<p><b>Ardent (Su): </b>Armigers are difficult to sway from their beliefs. At 2nd level, an armiger gains a +1 bonus on Will saves against charm effects. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 fighter levels beyond 2nd. Once per day, if an armiger is forced to take an action that is diametrically opposed to her order&#146;s beliefs and values while under the influence of a charm or compulsion effect, she can immediately attempt a Will save against the effect&#146;s DC to resist acting out that order. Success does not remove the existing charm or compulsion effect, but does allow the armiger to resist betraying her beliefs.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum -4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed.</p>
			<p>In addition, a fighter can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 7th level, a fighter can move at his normal speed while wearing heavy armor.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 5th level, a fighter can select one group of weapons, as noted below. Whenever he attacks with a weapon from this group, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls.</p>
			<p>Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), a fighter becomes further trained in another group of weapons. He gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when using a weapon from this group. In addition, the bonuses granted by previous weapon groups increase by +1 each. For example, when a fighter reaches 9th level, he receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with one weapon group and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the weapon group selected at 5th level. Bonuses granted from overlapping groups do not stack. Take the highest bonus granted for a weapon if it resides in two or more groups.</p>
			<p>A fighter also adds this bonus to any combat maneuver checks made with weapons from this group. This bonus also applies to the fighter's Combat Maneuver Defense when defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against weapons from this group.</p>
			<p>Weapon groups are defined as follows (GMs may add other weapons to these groups, or add entirely new groups) -</p>
			<p><b>Armor Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 19th level, a fighter gains DR 5/- whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (&#215;2 becomes &#215;3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The archer is dedicated to the careful mastery of the bow, perfecting his skills with years of practice honed day after day on ranges and hunting for game, or else on the battlefield, raining destruction down on the enemy lines.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Hawkeye (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, an archer gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks, and the range increment for any bow he uses increases by 5 feet. These bonuses increase by +1 and 5 additional feet for every 4 levels beyond 2nd. This ability replaces bravery.</p>
			<p><b>Trick Shot (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, an archer can choose one of the following combat maneuvers or actions: disarm, feint, or sunder. He can perform this action with a bow against any target within 30 feet, with a &#150;4 penalty to his CMB. Every four levels beyond 3rd, he may choose an additional trick shot to learn. These maneuvers use up arrows as normal.</p>
			<p>At 11th level, he may also choose from the following combat maneuvers: bull rush, grapple, trip. A target grappled by an arrow can break free by destroying the archer&#146;s arrow (hardness 5, hit points 1, break DC 13) or with an Escape Artist or CMB check (against the archer&#146;s CMD &#150;4). This ability replaces armor training 1, 2, 3, and 4.</p>
			<p><b>Expert Archer (Ex): </b>At 5th level, an archer gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with bows. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 5th. This ability replaces weapon training 1.</p>
			<p><b>Safe Shot (Ex): </b>At 9th level, an archer does not provoke attacks of opportunity when making ranged attacks with a bow. This ability replaces weapon training 2.</p>
			<p><b>Evasive Archer (Ex): </b>At 13th level, an archer gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC against ranged attacks. This bonus increases to +4 at 17th level. This ability replaces weapon training 3.</p>
			<p><b>Volley (Ex): </b>At 17th level, as a full-round action, an archer can make a single bow attack at his highest base attack bonus against any number of creatures in a 15-foot- radius burst, making separate attack and damage rolls for each creature. This ability replaces weapon training 4.</p>
			<p><b>Ranged Defense (Ex): </b>At 19th level, an archer gains DR 5/&#151; against ranged attacks. In addition, as an immediate action, he can catch an arrow fired at him and shoot it any target he chooses, as if he had the Snatch Arrows feat. This ability replaces armor mastery.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, an archer must choose a type of bow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (&#215;2 becomes &#215;3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.</p>

At 7th level, he can choose any of the five states of buoyancy once per turn as a free action, and can take his buoyancy movement as part of that free action instead of at the end of his turn without becoming off-balance and without requiring a Swim check; additionally, he can choose to double or halve how far a current moves him. At 11th level, whenever he takes a move, double move, withdraw, or run action underwater, he can leave a current behind him in the squares along his path; this current has a speed of 10 feet in the direction of his movement (if his movement was circuitous, so is the current) and lasts until the beginning of his next turn. At 15th level, as a full round action, an aquanaut can spin ferociously underwater, creating a whirlpool around himself with a spinning force that drags all creatures within 120 feet of him 30 feet closer to him. Creatures closer than 30 feet spend the 30 feet of movement circling around the aquanaut in a single direction of his choice. The whirlpool isn&#146;t fast enough to deal damage, but the aquanaut is unaffected by his own whirlpool, allowing him to make attacks of opportunity against creatures moving in it. At 19th level, the aquanaut learns to use the water around him to soften blows, gaining DR 5/&#151; while underwater.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Aquanaut fighters master the movement of water, using its flow to their advantage in combat.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons. An aquanaut is proficient with light and medium armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Piercing Focus: </b>If an aquanaut takes a fighter bonus feat that normally requires selecting a single weapon (except weapon proficiency feats), he can instead apply the feat to all melee piercing weapons with which he is already proficient and that meet all other prerequisites for that feat. This ability counts as having the feat for each such individual weapon for the purpose of meeting prerequisites. This ability also applies to the weapon mastery class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Tidal Celerity: </b>At 2nd level, an aquanaut gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves and saving throws against effects that would immobilize or paralyze him. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels beyond 2nd.</p>
			<p><b>Aquadynamic Paragon: </b>At 3rd level, an aquanaut gains a swim speed equal to his unmodified base land speed (if he has a racial swim speed, he instead increases it by 10 feet) and can choose to have a neutral buoyancy once per turn as a free action. At 7th level, he can choose any of the five states of buoyancy once per turn as a free action, and can take his buoyancy movement as part of that free action instead of at the end of his turn without becoming off-balance and without requiring a Swim check; additionally, he can choose to double or halve how far a current moves him. At 11th level, whenever he takes a move, double move, withdraw, or run action underwater, he can leave a current behind him in the squares along his path; this current has a speed of 10 feet in the direction of his movement (if his movement was circuitous, so is the current) and lasts until the beginning of his next turn. At 15th level, as a full round action, an aquanaut can spin ferociously underwater, creating a whirlpool around himself with a spinning force that drags all creatures within 120 feet of him 30 feet closer to him. Creatures closer than 30 feet spend the 30 feet of movement circling around the aquanaut in a single direction of his choice. The whirlpool isn&#146;t fast enough to deal damage, but the aquanaut is unaffected by his own whirlpool, allowing him to make attacks of opportunity against creatures moving in it. At 19th level, the aquanaut learns to use the water around him to soften blows, gaining DR 5/&#151; while underwater.</p>
			<p><b>Underwater Training: </b>At 5th level, an aquanaut chooses bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing melee weapons. If he chooses piercing melee weapons, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with those weapons when attacking underwater. If he chooses bludgeoning or slashing melee weapons, he can ignore the usual underwater penalties for attacking with those weapons (see page 44). At 9th and 13th levels, he can choose another type of melee weapon, applying this ability&#146;s initial benefit to his new choice and gaining an additional +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls to his previously chosen weapon types. At 17th level, he gains an additional +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with all three types.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 19th level, a fighter gains DR 5/- whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (&#215;2 becomes &#215;3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The Aldori swordlords of Brevoy are among the deadliest and most feared fighters of the Inner Sea. They have spent long years mastering the Aldori dueling sword, pitting themselves against other dueling swords and all manner of weaponry besides. Their speed and reflexes weave a net of impenetrable steel around them, from which they strike and harry their unfortunate opponents. The most common form of Aldori dueling (and arguably the easiest of the techniques to master) focuses on avoiding damage and disarming foes; these swordlords prefer to wear light or no armor, trusting their skill for protection. This archetype focuses on such techniques&#151;characters seeking a more offensive method of focusing training on the Aldori dueling sword should consider the Aldori swordlord prestige class on page 20. However, this archetype also synergizes well with the powers and skills the prestige class offers.</i></p>
			<p><i>The following benefits apply only when an Aldori defender is wielding an Aldori dueling sword (see page 24) and carrying nothing in his other hand. An Aldori defender fights with his sword wielded with both hands only in moments of desperation.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (including tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Bravery (Ex) </b>: Starting at 2nd level, a fighter gains a +1 bonus on Will saves against fear. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd.</p>
			<p><b>Defensive Parry (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, when an Aldori defender makes a full attack with an Aldori dueling sword, he gains a +1 shield bonus to his AC against melee attacks until the beginning of his next turn. This bonus increases to +2 at 7th level, +3 at 11th level, and +4 at 15th level.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 5th level, a fighter can select one group of weapons, as noted below. Whenever he attacks with a weapon from this group, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls.</p>
			<p>Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), a fighter becomes further trained in another group of weapons. He gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when using a weapon from this group. In addition, the bonuses granted by previous weapon groups increase by +1 each. For example, when a fighter reaches 9th level, he receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with one weapon group and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the weapon group selected at 5th level. Bonuses granted from overlapping groups do not stack. Take the highest bonus granted for a weapon if it resides in two or more groups.</p>
			<p>A fighter also adds this bonus to any combat maneuver checks made with weapons from this group. This bonus also applies to the fighter's Combat Maneuver Defense when defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against weapons from this group.</p>
			<p>Weapon groups are defined as follows (GMs may add other weapons to these groups, or add entirely new groups) -</p>
			<p><b>Disarming Strike (Ex): </b>At 6th level, when an Aldori defender successfully disarms an opponent using an Aldori dueling sword, he also deals normal damage to the target, but without the normal Strength bonus to damage.</p>
			<p><b>Steel Net (Ex): </b>At 8th level, an Aldori defender can create a blazing wall of steel to defend himself. When fighting defensively as a full-round action with an Aldori dueling sword, the Aldori defender&#146;s penalties on all attacks in a round are reduced by 2, and his dodge bonus to AC increases by 2 for the same round.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the bonus feat the fighter would normally gain at 8th level.</p>
			<p><b>Counterattack (Ex): </b>At 10th level, once per round, an Aldori defender can make an attack of opportunity against an opponent who hits him with a melee attack (regardless of how many attacks of opportunity the Aldori defender can otherwise make), so long as the attacking creature is within the his reach.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 19th level, a fighter gains DR 5/- whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (&#215;2 becomes &#215;3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Driven by suspicion and hatred, strix doggedly guard their territories, making deadly use of their flight. Using swift strikes from above, strix plummet onto their foes with lethal force.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light and medium armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (excluding tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Combat Flyer (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, an airborne ambusher may use his fighter bonus feats to select Flyby Attack and Hover. This replaces bravery.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum -4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed.</p>
			<p>In addition, a fighter can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 7th level, a fighter can move at his normal speed while wearing heavy armor.</p>
			<p><b>Aerobatics (Ex): </b>At 5th level, an airborne ambusher may make a Fly check instead of an Acrobatics check to move through a threatened area or an enemy&#146;s space. This replaces weapon training 1.</p>
			<p><b>Flying Dodger (Ex): </b>At 9th level, when an airborne ambusher flies at least half its fly speed on its turn, it gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC for 1 round. This bonus increases to +2 at 11th level and +4 at 17th level. This ability replaces weapon training 2.</p>
			<p><b>Plummeting Charge (Ex): </b>At 13th level, if an airborne ambusher flies at least half its fly speed as part of a charge, it gains a +2 racial bonus on the attack roll (in addition to the normal charge bonus) and a +4 bonus on its critical confirmation roll. These bonuses improve to +4 and +6 at 17th level. This replaces weapon training 3 and 4.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 19th level, a fighter gains DR 5/- whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Mastery (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (&#215;2 becomes &#215;3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.</p>

					<p>At 19th level, an aerial assaulter can perform an aerial dodge that allows him to evade attacks while flying. As an immediate action, when an opponent attempts an attack against the aerial assaulter, he can attempt a Fly check with a DC equal to the result of the attacker&#146;s attack roll. If he succeeds, he can take a 5-foot step and gain a dodge bonus to his AC equal to his Dexterity modifier. This movement doesn&#146;t negate the attack if the aerial assaulter remains in range of the attacking enemy&#146;s reach at the end of the 5-foot step. If the Fly check fails, the aerial assaulter does not move, does not gain an AC bonus, and provokes an attack of opportunity from each creature that threatens him, including the initial attacker.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>As staunch believers in the value of higher ground, the Shory developed special fighting styles that capitalize on fighting from above. While many dismiss such techniques as a niche tactic, aerial assaulters leap to great heights and create higher ground where there is none.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Fighters excel at combat&#151;defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Fighter's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), and Survival (Wis).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (including tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat </b>: At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called &#34;fighter bonus feats.&#34;</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>
			<p><b>Aerial Expertise (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, an aerial assaulter gains a +2 bonus on Fly checks. Additionally, whenever he is affected by a spell or ability that grants him a fly speed, he treats that spell or ability as though its caster level were 2 higher for the purposes of determining its effects. At 6th level and every 4 levels thereafter, this bonus on Fly checks increases by an additional 2, to a maximum of +10 at 18th level.</p>
			<p><b>Take the High Ground (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, an aerial assaulter can leap above his foes to gain an advantage in combat. As a move action, he can attempt an Acrobatics check with the DC equal to the CMD of an adjacent enemy. If he succeeds, the aerial assaulter is treated as if he had higher ground against that enemy until the beginning of his next turn. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, an aerial assaulter increases his bonus from higher ground by 1, to a total of a +6 bonus at 20th level. At 12th level, an aerial assaulter can use this ability as a swift action.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum -4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed.</p>
			<p>In addition, a fighter can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 7th level, a fighter can move at his normal speed while wearing heavy armor.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Training (Ex) </b>: Starting at 5th level, a fighter can select one group of weapons, as noted below. Whenever he attacks with a weapon from this group, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls.</p>
			<p>Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), a fighter becomes further trained in another group of weapons. He gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when using a weapon from this group. In addition, the bonuses granted by previous weapon groups increase by +1 each. For example, when a fighter reaches 9th level, he receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with one weapon group and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the weapon group selected at 5th level. Bonuses granted from overlapping groups do not stack. Take the highest bonus granted for a weapon if it resides in two or more groups.</p>
			<p>A fighter also adds this bonus to any combat maneuver checks made with weapons from this group. This bonus also applies to the fighter's Combat Maneuver Defense when defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against weapons from this group.</p>
			<p>Weapon groups are defined as follows (GMs may add other weapons to these groups, or add entirely new groups) -</p>
			<p><b>Aerial Dodge (Ex): </b>At 19th level, an aerial assaulter can perform an aerial dodge that allows him to evade attacks while flying. As an immediate action, when an opponent attempts an attack against the aerial assaulter, he can attempt a Fly check with a DC equal to the result of the attacker&#146;s attack roll. If he succeeds, he can take a 5-foot step and gain a dodge bonus to his AC equal to his Dexterity modifier. This movement doesn&#146;t negate the attack if the aerial assaulter remains in range of the attacking enemy&#146;s reach at the end of the 5-foot step. If the Fly check fails, the aerial assaulter does not move, does not gain an AC bonus, and provokes an attack of opportunity from each creature that threatens him, including the initial attacker. The aerial assaulter must be flying to use this ability.</p>
			<p><b>High Ground Mastery (Ex): </b>At 20th level, whenever an aerial assaulter threatens a critical hit with an attack made from higher ground, he automatically confirms the critical hit, and the weapon&#146;s damage multiplier is increased by 1. In addition, all bull rush, dirty trick, drag, grapple, reposition, and trip combat maneuver checks against the aerial assaulter fail when attempted by opponents on lower ground than he is.</p>
