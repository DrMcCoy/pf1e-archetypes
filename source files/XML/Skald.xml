					<p>A skald is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and even using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>

					<p>Skalds learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;11: Skald Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>

					<p>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>

				<name type="string">Raging Song</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
					<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
					<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>
					<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally&#146;s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald&#146;s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song&#146;s effects last for that ally&#146;s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p>
					<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p>
					<p><i>Inspired Rage (Su): </i>At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but also take a &#150;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of inspired rage, allies other than the skald cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonuses on Will saves increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn&#146;t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian&#146;s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p>
					<p>If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian&#146;s rage, bloodrager&#146;s bloodrage, or skald&#146;s inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
					<p><i>Dirge of Doom (Su): </i>At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become shaken. This only affects enemies that are within 30 feet and able to hear the skald&#146;s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance. This cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the targets are already shaken from another effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect, and relies on audible components.</p>
					<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>

					<p>At 2nd level, a skald can choose one type of Perform skill associated with the skald class. He can use his bonus in that skill in place of his bonus in the associated skills listed below.

				<name type="string">Rage Power</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32&#150;34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).</p>
					<p>Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.</p>
					<p>When starting an inspired rage, the skald chooses which rage powers (if any) to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of these rage powers, using the skald&#146;s level as their effective barbarian level. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers that require a minimum barbarian level. If the rage power&#146;s effects depend on the skald&#146;s ability modif ier (such as lesser spirit totemAPG), affected allies use the skald&#146;s ability modif ier instead of their own for the purposes of this effect.</p>
					<p>If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptiveAPG, which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power&#146;s prerequisite. He may add multiple rage powers to an inspired rage at the same time using this ability (such as granting superstition and disruptive simultaneously).</p>
					<p>If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage).</p>
					<p>If the skald has rage powers from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during an inspired rage. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times.</p>
					<p>If the skald has the ability to rage from another source, he can use his skald rage powers during that rage as well.</p>

Casting a spell with spell kenning always has a minimum casting time of 1 full round, regardless of the casting time of the spell.</p>
					<p>At 11th level, a skald can use this ability twice per day. At 17th level, he can use this ability three times per day.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>-</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skalds are poets, historians, and keepers of lore who use their gifts for oration and song to inspire allies into a frenzied rage. They balance a violent spirit with the veneer of civilization, recording events such as heroic battles and the deeds of great leaders, enhancing these stories in the retelling to earn bloodier victories in combat. A skald&#146;s poetry is nuanced and often has multiple overlapping meanings, and he applies similar talents to emulate magic from other spellcasters.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A skald inspires his allies, and often presses forward to fight enemies in melee. Outside of combat, he&#146;s useful as a healer and scholar, less versatile but more durable than a bard.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Barbarian and bard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Skald's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (oratory, percussion, sing, string, wind) (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A skald is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and even using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
			<p><b>Bardic Knowledge (Ex): </b>A skald adds 1/2 his class level (minimum 1) on all Knowledge skill checks, and may make all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Skalds learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;11: Skald Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Raging Song (Su): </b>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
			<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
			<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>
			<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally&#146;s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald&#146;s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song&#146;s effects last for that ally&#146;s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p>
			<p><i>Inspired Rage (Su): </i>At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but also take a &#150;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of inspired rage, allies other than the skald cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonuses on Will saves increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn&#146;t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian&#146;s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p>
			<p>If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian&#146;s rage, bloodrager&#146;s bloodrage, or skald&#146;s inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
			<p><i>Dirge of Doom (Su): </i>At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become shaken. This only affects enemies that are within 30 feet and able to hear the skald&#146;s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance. This cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the targets are already shaken from another effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect, and relies on audible components.</p>
			<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>
			<p><b>Scribe Scroll: </b>At 1st level, a skald gains Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Versatile Performance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a skald can choose one type of Perform skill associated with the skald class. He can use his bonus in that skill in place of his bonus in the associated skills listed below. When substituting in this way, the skald uses his total Perform skill bonus, including class skill bonus, in place of the associated skill&#146;s bonus, whether or not he has ranks in that skill or if it is a class skill. At 7th level, and every 5 levels thereafter, the bard can select an additional type of Perform to substitute.</p>
			<p>The types of Perform and their associated skills are: Oratory (Diplomacy, Sense Motive), Percussion (Handle Animal, Intimidate), Sing (Bluff, Sense Motive), String (Bluff, Diplomacy), and Wind (Diplomacy, Handle Animal).</p>
			<p><b>Well-Versed (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, the skald becomes resistant to sonic effects. The skald gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made against bardic performance, as well as all sonic or language-dependent effects.</p>
			<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex): </b>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32&#150;34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.</p>
			<p>When starting an inspired rage, the skald chooses which rage powers (if any) to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of these rage powers, using the skald&#146;s level as their effective barbarian level. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers that require a minimum barbarian level. If the rage power&#146;s effects depend on the skald&#146;s ability modif ier (such as lesser spirit totemAPG), affected allies use the skald&#146;s ability modif ier instead of their own for the purposes of this effect.</p>
			<p>If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptiveAPG, which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power&#146;s prerequisite. He may add multiple rage powers to an inspired rage at the same time using this ability (such as granting superstition and disruptive simultaneously).</p>
			<p>If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage).</p>
			<p>If the skald has rage powers from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during an inspired rage. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times.</p>
			<p>If the skald has the ability to rage from another source, he can use his skald rage powers during that rage as well.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a skald gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if he is immobilized. A skald with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
			<p>If a skald already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Spell Kenning (Su): </b>At 5th level, a skald is learned in the magic of other spellcasters, and can use his own magic to duplicate those classes&#146; spells. Once per day, a skald can cast any spell on the bard, cleric, or sorcerer/wizard spell list as if it were one of his skald spells known, expending a skald spell slot of the same spell level to cast the desired spell. Casting a spell with spell kenning always has a minimum casting time of 1 full round, regardless of the casting time of the spell.</p>
			<p>At 11th level, a skald can use this ability twice per day. At 17th level, he can use this ability three times per day.</p>
			<p><b>Lore Master (Ex): </b>At 7th level, the skald becomes a master of many different types of lore, and can choose to take 10 on any Knowledge skill check that he has ranks in. Once per day, the skald can take 20 on any Knowledge skill check as a standard action, instead of spending the normal time taking 20 requires. He can use this ability to take 20 on a Knowledge skill check twice per day at 13th level and three times per day 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level and higher, a skald can no longer be flanked. This defense denies enemies the ability to sneak attack the skald by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more levels in a class that grants sneak attack than the target has skald levels.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a skald gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the skald takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 14th and 19th levels, this damage reduction increases by 1. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0. Additionally, the skald grants this DR to all allies affected by his inspired rage.</p>
			<p><b>Master Skald (Su): </b>At 20th level, a skald&#146;s inspired rage no longer gives allies a penalty to AC, nor limits what skills or abilities they can use. Allies with rage class abilities may use features dependent on those abilities without restriction, such as a barbarian&#146;s rage powers and a bloodrager&#146;s blood casting and bloodline abilities. Finally, when making a full attack, affected allies may make an additional attack each round (as if using a haste effect).</p>

					<p>A skald is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and even using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>

					<p>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>

				<name type="string">Raging Song</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
					<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
					<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>
					<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally&#146;s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald&#146;s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song&#146;s effects last for that ally&#146;s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p>
					<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p>
					<p><i>Inspired Rage (Su): </i>At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but also take a &#150;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of inspired rage, allies other than the skald cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonuses on Will saves increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn&#146;t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian&#146;s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p>
					<p>If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian&#146;s rage, bloodrager&#146;s bloodrage, or skald&#146;s inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
					<p><i>Dirge of Doom (Su): </i>At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become shaken. This only affects enemies that are within 30 feet and able to hear the skald&#146;s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance. This cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the targets are already shaken from another effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect, and relies on audible components.</p>
					<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32&#150;34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).</p>
					<p>Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.</p>
					<p>When starting an inspired rage, the skald chooses which rage powers (if any) to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of these rage powers, using the skald&#146;s level as their effective barbarian level. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers that require a minimum barbarian level. If the rage power&#146;s effects depend on the skald&#146;s ability modif ier (such as lesser spirit totemAPG), affected allies use the skald&#146;s ability modif ier instead of their own for the purposes of this effect.</p>

					<p>If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Wyrm singers spin fragments of the story of the ongoing struggle between noble Apsu and wicked Dahak.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skalds are poets, historians, and keepers of lore who use their gifts for oration and song to inspire allies into a frenzied rage. They balance a violent spirit with the veneer of civilization, recording events such as heroic battles and the deeds of great leaders, enhancing these stories in the retelling to earn bloodier victories in combat. A skald&#146;s poetry is nuanced and often has multiple overlapping meanings, and he applies similar talents to emulate magic from other spellcasters.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A skald inspires his allies, and often presses forward to fight enemies in melee. Outside of combat, he&#146;s useful as a healer and scholar, less versatile but more durable than a bard.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Barbarian and bard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Skald's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (oratory, percussion, sing, string, wind) (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A skald is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and even using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
			<p><b>Bardic Knowledge (Ex): </b>A skald adds 1/2 his class level (minimum 1) on all Knowledge skill checks, and may make all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Skalds learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;11: Skald Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Raging Song (Su): </b>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
			<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
			<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>
			<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally&#146;s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald&#146;s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song&#146;s effects last for that ally&#146;s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p>
			<p><i>Inspired Rage (Su): </i>At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but also take a &#150;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of inspired rage, allies other than the skald cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonuses on Will saves increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn&#146;t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian&#146;s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p>
			<p>If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian&#146;s rage, bloodrager&#146;s bloodrage, or skald&#146;s inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
			<p><i>Dirge of Doom (Su): </i>At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become shaken. This only affects enemies that are within 30 feet and able to hear the skald&#146;s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance. This cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the targets are already shaken from another effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect, and relies on audible components.</p>
			<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>
			<p><b>Scribe Scroll: </b>At 1st level, a skald gains Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Wyrm Song (Su): </b>A wyrm singer gains the following raging songs.</p>
			<p><i>Draconic Rage (Su): </i>At 1st level, a wyrm singer can kindle an echo of ancient rage felt between warring dragon clans in his allies. This ability acts as inspired rage, except those affected gain a +2 morale bonus on melee attack and damage rolls and a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against paralysis and sleep effects (but they still take a &#150;1 penalty to their AC), rather than inspired rage&#146;s normal bonuses. At 4th level and every 4 skald levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonuses on saves against paralysis and sleep effects increase by 1. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonus on melee attack and damage rolls increases by 1.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces inspired rage.</p>
			<p><i>Wyrm Saga (Su): </i>At 14th level, a wyrm singer embraces the essence of the draconic histories, allowing his allies to manifest aspects of a dragon in their physical forms. The wyrm singer selects a single ally within 60 feet to take on a draconic aspect (as per form of the dragon I) of a type of the wyrm singer&#146;s choice. The ally cannot use the breath weapon attack provided by form of the dragon. The wyrm singer must expend 1 round of raging song each round to maintain wyrm saga, and can affect only a single ally at a time.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces song of the fallen.</p>
			<p><b>Versatile Performance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a skald can choose one type of Perform skill associated with the skald class. He can use his bonus in that skill in place of his bonus in the associated skills listed below. When substituting in this way, the skald uses his total Perform skill bonus, including class skill bonus, in place of the associated skill&#146;s bonus, whether or not he has ranks in that skill or if it is a class skill. At 7th level, and every 5 levels thereafter, the bard can select an additional type of Perform to substitute.</p>
			<p>The types of Perform and their associated skills are: Oratory (Diplomacy, Sense Motive), Percussion (Handle Animal, Intimidate), Sing (Bluff, Sense Motive), String (Bluff, Diplomacy), and Wind (Diplomacy, Handle Animal).</p>
			<p><b>Well-Versed (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, the skald becomes resistant to sonic effects. The skald gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made against bardic performance, as well as all sonic or language-dependent effects.</p>
			<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex): </b>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32&#150;34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.</p>
			<p>When starting an inspired rage, the skald chooses which rage powers (if any) to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of these rage powers, using the skald&#146;s level as their effective barbarian level. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers that require a minimum barbarian level. If the rage power&#146;s effects depend on the skald&#146;s ability modif ier (such as lesser spirit totemAPG), affected allies use the skald&#146;s ability modif ier instead of their own for the purposes of this effect.</p>
			<p>If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptiveAPG, which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power&#146;s prerequisite. He may add multiple rage powers to an inspired rage at the same time using this ability (such as granting superstition and disruptive simultaneously).</p>
			<p>If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage).</p>
			<p>If the skald has rage powers from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during an inspired rage. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times.</p>
			<p>If the skald has the ability to rage from another source, he can use his skald rage powers during that rage as well.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a skald gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if he is immobilized. A skald with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
			<p>If a skald already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Spell Kenning (Su): </b>At 5th level, a skald is learned in the magic of other spellcasters, and can use his own magic to duplicate those classes&#146; spells. Once per day, a skald can cast any spell on the bard, cleric, or sorcerer/wizard spell list as if it were one of his skald spells known, expending a skald spell slot of the same spell level to cast the desired spell. Casting a spell with spell kenning always has a minimum casting time of 1 full round, regardless of the casting time of the spell.</p>
			<p>At 11th level, a skald can use this ability twice per day. At 17th level, he can use this ability three times per day.</p>
			<p><b>Lore Master (Ex): </b>At 7th level, the skald becomes a master of many different types of lore, and can choose to take 10 on any Knowledge skill check that he has ranks in. Once per day, the skald can take 20 on any Knowledge skill check as a standard action, instead of spending the normal time taking 20 requires. He can use this ability to take 20 on a Knowledge skill check twice per day at 13th level and three times per day 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level and higher, a skald can no longer be flanked. This defense denies enemies the ability to sneak attack the skald by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more levels in a class that grants sneak attack than the target has skald levels.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a skald gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the skald takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 14th and 19th levels, this damage reduction increases by 1. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0. Additionally, the skald grants this DR to all allies affected by his inspired rage.</p>
			<p><b>Breath Weapon (Su): </b>At 12th level, once per day as a swift action, a wyrm singer can grant a breath weapon attack to himself or an ally affected by his draconic rage raging song. Using the breath weapon is a standard action, and it affects creatures in a 30-foot cone or a 60-foot line. The breath weapons deals 1d6 points of damage per 2 skald levels the wyrm singer has, and is of an energy type of the wyrm singer&#146;s choice (acid, cold, electricity, or fire). Creatures caught in the area can attempt a Reflex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the wyrm singer&#146;s skald level + his Charisma modifier) to halve the damage.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the rage power gained at 12th level.</p>
			<p><b>Master Skald (Su): </b>At 20th level, a skald&#146;s inspired rage no longer gives allies a penalty to AC, nor limits what skills or abilities they can use. Allies with rage class abilities may use features dependent on those abilities without restriction, such as a barbarian&#146;s rage powers and a bloodrager&#146;s blood casting and bloodline abilities. Finally, when making a full attack, affected allies may make an additional attack each round (as if using a haste effect).</p>

					<p>A skald is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and even using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>

					<p>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>

				<level type="number">1</level>
				<name type="string">Raging Song</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
					<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
					<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>
					<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally&#146;s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald&#146;s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song&#146;s effects last for that ally&#146;s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p>
					<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p>
					<p><i>Inspired Rage (Su): </i>At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but also take a &#150;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of inspired rage, allies other than the skald cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonuses on Will saves increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn&#146;t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian&#146;s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p>
					<p>If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian&#146;s rage, bloodrager&#146;s bloodrage, or skald&#146;s inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
					<p><i>Dirge of Doom (Su): </i>At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become shaken. This only affects enemies that are within 30 feet and able to hear the skald&#146;s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance. This cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the targets are already shaken from another effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect, and relies on audible components.</p>
					<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32&#150;34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).</p>
					<p>Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.</p>
					<p>When starting an inspired rage, the skald chooses which rage powers (if any) to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of these rage powers, using the skald&#146;s level as their effective barbarian level. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers that require a minimum barbarian level. If the rage power&#146;s effects depend on the skald&#146;s ability modif ier (such as lesser spirit totemAPG), affected allies use the skald&#146;s ability modif ier instead of their own for the purposes of this effect.</p>
					<p>If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptiveAPG, which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power&#146;s prerequisite. He may add multiple rage powers to an inspired rage at the same time using this ability (such as granting superstition and disruptive simultaneously).</p>
					<p>If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage).</p>
					<p>If the skald has rage powers from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during an inspired rage. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times.</p>
					<p>If the skald has the ability to rage from another source, he can use his skald rage powers during that rage as well.</p>

A skald with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>

This raging song works like distraction, except that it applies to saving throws against fear effects instead of patterns and figments, and the warlord attempts an Intimidate check with a &#150;10 penalty instead of a Perform check. Additionally, the warlord&#146;s allies can use the warlord&#146;s Intimidate check result (with the &#150;10 penalty) as the DC for attempts to demoralize them using Intimidate.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The warlord wields his force of personality like a weapon, intimidating his allies and ensuring that his followers heed his commands. The warlord doesn&#146;t inspire his followers so much as instill fear in them. Always watching his foes for moments of vulnerability, the warlord seeks to exploit his enemies&#146; weaknesses to gain victory.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skalds are poets, historians, and keepers of lore who use their gifts for oration and song to inspire allies into a frenzied rage. They balance a violent spirit with the veneer of civilization, recording events such as heroic battles and the deeds of great leaders, enhancing these stories in the retelling to earn bloodier victories in combat. A skald&#146;s poetry is nuanced and often has multiple overlapping meanings, and he applies similar talents to emulate magic from other spellcasters.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A skald inspires his allies, and often presses forward to fight enemies in melee. Outside of combat, he&#146;s useful as a healer and scholar, less versatile but more durable than a bard.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Barbarian and bard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Skald's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (oratory, percussion, sing, string, wind) (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A skald is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and even using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
			<p><b>Bardic Knowledge (Ex): </b>A skald adds 1/2 his class level (minimum 1) on all Knowledge skill checks, and may make all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Skalds learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;11: Skald Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Intimidating Prowess: </b>A warlord gains Intimidating Prowess as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p>This feat replaces the Scribe Scroll feat.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Raging Song (Su): </b>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
			<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
			<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>
			<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally&#146;s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald&#146;s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song&#146;s effects last for that ally&#146;s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p>
			<p><i>Inspired Rage (Su): </i>At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but also take a &#150;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of inspired rage, allies other than the skald cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonuses on Will saves increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn&#146;t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian&#146;s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p>
			<p>If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian&#146;s rage, bloodrager&#146;s bloodrage, or skald&#146;s inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
			<p><i>Dirge of Doom (Su): </i>At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become shaken. This only affects enemies that are within 30 feet and able to hear the skald&#146;s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance. This cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the targets are already shaken from another effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect, and relies on audible components.</p>
			<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>
			<p><b>Versatile Performance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a skald can choose one type of Perform skill associated with the skald class. He can use his bonus in that skill in place of his bonus in the associated skills listed below. When substituting in this way, the skald uses his total Perform skill bonus, including class skill bonus, in place of the associated skill&#146;s bonus, whether or not he has ranks in that skill or if it is a class skill. At 7th level, and every 5 levels thereafter, the bard can select an additional type of Perform to substitute.</p>
			<p>The types of Perform and their associated skills are: Oratory (Diplomacy, Sense Motive), Percussion (Handle Animal, Intimidate), Sing (Bluff, Sense Motive), String (Bluff, Diplomacy), and Wind (Diplomacy, Handle Animal).</p>
			<p><b>Unshakable (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a warlord develops an unshakable resolve, gaining a +2 bonus on saving throws against fear effects.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces well-versed</p>
			<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex): </b>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32&#150;34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.</p>
			<p>When starting an inspired rage, the skald chooses which rage powers (if any) to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of these rage powers, using the skald&#146;s level as their effective barbarian level. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers that require a minimum barbarian level. If the rage power&#146;s effects depend on the skald&#146;s ability modif ier (such as lesser spirit totemAPG), affected allies use the skald&#146;s ability modif ier instead of their own for the purposes of this effect.</p>
			<p>If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptiveAPG, which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power&#146;s prerequisite. He may add multiple rage powers to an inspired rage at the same time using this ability (such as granting superstition and disruptive simultaneously).</p>
			<p>If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage).</p>
			<p>If the skald has rage powers from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during an inspired rage. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times.</p>
			<p>If the skald has the ability to rage from another source, he can use his skald rage powers during that rage as well.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a skald gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if he is immobilized. A skald with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
			<p>If a skald already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Fear Me (Su): </b>At 5th level, the warlord can remind his allies that failing him is far more frightening than the opposition. This raging song works like distraction, except that it applies to saving throws against fear effects instead of patterns and figments, and the warlord attempts an Intimidate check with a &#150;10 penalty instead of a Perform check. Additionally, the warlord&#146;s allies can use the warlord&#146;s Intimidate check result (with the &#150;10 penalty) as the DC for attempts to demoralize them using Intimidate.</p>
			<p><b>Minions (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a warlord attracts a group of followers through his fearsome reputation and gains the Leadership feat as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p>This replaces the lore master ability.</p>
			<p><b>Intimidated Push (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a warlord inspires fear in his cohort and followers, ensuring they do not fail and thus suffer his wrath. When he uses inspired rage, his cohort increases her morale bonus on Will saves from inspired rage by 1 and his followers increase their morale bonuses on Will saves from inspired rage by 2.</p>
			<p>This replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a skald gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the skald takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 14th and 19th levels, this damage reduction increases by 1. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0. Additionally, the skald grants this DR to all allies affected by his inspired rage.</p>
			<p><b>Master Skald (Su): </b>At 20th level, a skald&#146;s inspired rage no longer gives allies a penalty to AC, nor limits what skills or abilities they can use. Allies with rage class abilities may use features dependent on those abilities without restriction, such as a barbarian&#146;s rage powers and a bloodrager&#146;s blood casting and bloodline abilities. Finally, when making a full attack, affected allies may make an additional attack each round (as if using a haste effect).</p>

					<p>A skald is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and even using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>

					<p>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>

				<name type="string">Raging Song</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
					<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
					<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>
					<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally&#146;s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald&#146;s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song&#146;s effects last for that ally&#146;s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p>
					<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p>
					<p><i>Inspired Rage (Su): </i>At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but also take a &#150;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of inspired rage, allies other than the skald cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonuses on Will saves increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn&#146;t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian&#146;s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p>
					<p>If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian&#146;s rage, bloodrager&#146;s bloodrage, or skald&#146;s inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
					<p><i>Dirge of Doom (Su): </i>At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become shaken. This only affects enemies that are within 30 feet and able to hear the skald&#146;s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance. This cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the targets are already shaken from another effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect, and relies on audible components.</p>
					<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>

				<name type="string">Rage Power</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32&#150;34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).</p>
					<p>Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.</p>
					<p>When starting an inspired rage, the skald chooses which rage powers (if any) to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of these rage powers, using the skald&#146;s level as their effective barbarian level. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers that require a minimum barbarian level. If the rage power&#146;s effects depend on the skald&#146;s ability modif ier (such as lesser spirit totemAPG), affected allies use the skald&#146;s ability modif ier instead of their own for the purposes of this effect.</p>
					<p>If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptiveAPG, which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power&#146;s prerequisite. He may add multiple rage powers to an inspired rage at the same time using this ability (such as granting superstition and disruptive simultaneously).</p>
					<p>If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage).</p>
					<p>If the skald has rage powers from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during an inspired rage. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times.</p>
					<p>If the skald has the ability to rage from another source, he can use his skald rage powers during that rage as well.</p>

				<name type="string">Uncanny Dodge</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, a skald gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if he is immobilized. A skald with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
					<p>If a skald already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>

				<name type="string">Thousand Totems</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 5th level, a war painter can channel a powerful totem into his furious paints while applying the pigments on an ally. This grants the painted ally the benefits of one additional rage power when the ally activates the furious paints. The war painter does not need to know the rage power, but it must be one for which he qualifies. Furthermore, the war painter can select only a blood rage power (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide 80) or a totem rage power (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&#146;s Guide 74). If the war painter already has a different blood rage or totem rage power that would be applied to the painted ally, this new rage power replaces it and any other rage powers that require it as a prerequisite.</p>
					<p>A war painter can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and he gains one additional use at 11th and 17th levels. He can apply this ability multiple times to the same creature, though only to give it rage powers that use the granted rage power as a prerequisite (such as beast totem and greater beast totem).</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 7th level, once per day as he finishes applying his furious paint to a creature, a war painter can cast one skald spell with a casting time of no more than 1 standard action and infuse the spell into the paint. Once while benefiting from the paint&#146;s raging song, the painted ally can use a standard action to cast the infused spell on herself as if the war painter had cast it. The spell ends when the paint&#146;s other effects end. A war painter can infuse only a skald spell whose level is at least 2 levels lower than the highest-level skald spell he can cast. He can infuse any targeted spell in a painted ally, even if its range is personal. The war painter can use this ability twice per day at 13th level and three times per day at 19th level.</p>

					<p>At 8th level and higher, a skald can no longer be flanked. This defense denies enemies the ability to sneak attack the skald by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more levels in a class that grants sneak attack than the target has skald levels.</p>
					<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level required to flank the character.</p>

Allies with rage class abilities may use features dependent on those abilities without restriction, such as a barbarian&#146;s rage powers and a bloodrager&#146;s blood casting and bloodline abilities. Finally, when making a full attack, affected allies may make an additional attack each round (as if using a haste effect).</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>By spending 10 minutes preparing and applying special paints to his or an ally&#146;s skin, a war painter can create patterns that store the effects of one of his raging songs. The war painter must expend 1 or more rounds of his raging song class ability while anointing the ally, and the paint retains its potency until the war painter recovers his daily uses of raging song. The ally can activate the paint as a move action, gaining the benefits of the raging song, including any rage powers as appropriate. This effect lasts a number of rounds equal to the rounds of raging song the war painter expended + the war painter&#146;s ranks in Craft (calligraphy, paintings, or tattoos)&#151;but no more than double the number of rounds of raging song expended. By halving the remaining number of rounds of raging song, an ally can suspend the paint&#146;s effects as a free action and activate the paint again later as a move action.</p>
					<p>A war painter cab apply the effects of any feats that affect bardic performance to his furious paint, except effects that extend the effects of performances, such as the Lingering Song feat. A creature can be subject to only one application of furious paint at a time.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The gripplis of the Valashmai Jungle exhibit savage strength for their size&#151;attributed in part to the frightful magical pigments applied to their skin by the tribes&#146; mystical lore keepers.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skalds are poets, historians, and keepers of lore who use their gifts for oration and song to inspire allies into a frenzied rage. They balance a violent spirit with the veneer of civilization, recording events such as heroic battles and the deeds of great leaders, enhancing these stories in the retelling to earn bloodier victories in combat. A skald&#146;s poetry is nuanced and often has multiple overlapping meanings, and he applies similar talents to emulate magic from other spellcasters.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A skald inspires his allies, and often presses forward to fight enemies in melee. Outside of combat, he&#146;s useful as a healer and scholar, less versatile but more durable than a bard.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Barbarian and bard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Skald's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (oratory, percussion, sing, string, wind) (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A skald is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and even using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
			<p><b>Bardic Knowledge (Ex): </b>A skald adds 1/2 his class level (minimum 1) on all Knowledge skill checks, and may make all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Skalds learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;11: Skald Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Furious Paint (Su): </b>By spending 10 minutes preparing and applying special paints to his or an ally&#146;s skin, a war painter can create patterns that store the effects of one of his raging songs. The war painter must expend 1 or more rounds of his raging song class ability while anointing the ally, and the paint retains its potency until the war painter recovers his daily uses of raging song. The ally can activate the paint as a move action, gaining the benefits of the raging song, including any rage powers as appropriate. This effect lasts a number of rounds equal to the rounds of raging song the war painter expended + the war painter&#146;s ranks in Craft (calligraphy, paintings, or tattoos)&#151;but no more than double the number of rounds of raging song expended. By halving the remaining number of rounds of raging song, an ally can suspend the paint&#146;s effects as a free action and activate the paint again later as a move action.</p>
			<p>A war painter cab apply the effects of any feats that affect bardic performance to his furious paint, except effects that extend the effects of performances, such as the Lingering Song feat. A creature can be subject to only one application of furious paint at a time.</p>
			<p>This ability modifies the raging song class feature and does not prevent a war painter from performing other raging songs.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Raging Song (Su): </b>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
			<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
			<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>
			<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally&#146;s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald&#146;s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song&#146;s effects last for that ally&#146;s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p>
			<p><i>Inspired Rage (Su): </i>At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but also take a &#150;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of inspired rage, allies other than the skald cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonuses on Will saves increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn&#146;t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian&#146;s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p>
			<p>If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian&#146;s rage, bloodrager&#146;s bloodrage, or skald&#146;s inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
			<p><i>Dirge of Doom (Su): </i>At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become shaken. This only affects enemies that are within 30 feet and able to hear the skald&#146;s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance. This cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the targets are already shaken from another effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect, and relies on audible components.</p>
			<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>
			<p><b>Scribe Scroll: </b>At 1st level, a skald gains Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Versatile Performance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a skald can choose one type of Perform skill associated with the skald class. He can use his bonus in that skill in place of his bonus in the associated skills listed below. When substituting in this way, the skald uses his total Perform skill bonus, including class skill bonus, in place of the associated skill&#146;s bonus, whether or not he has ranks in that skill or if it is a class skill. At 7th level, and every 5 levels thereafter, the bard can select an additional type of Perform to substitute.</p>
			<p>The types of Perform and their associated skills are: Oratory (Diplomacy, Sense Motive), Percussion (Handle Animal, Intimidate), Sing (Bluff, Sense Motive), String (Bluff, Diplomacy), and Wind (Diplomacy, Handle Animal).</p>
			<p><b>Well-Versed (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, the skald becomes resistant to sonic effects. The skald gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made against bardic performance, as well as all sonic or language-dependent effects.</p>
			<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex): </b>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32&#150;34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.</p>
			<p>When starting an inspired rage, the skald chooses which rage powers (if any) to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of these rage powers, using the skald&#146;s level as their effective barbarian level. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers that require a minimum barbarian level. If the rage power&#146;s effects depend on the skald&#146;s ability modif ier (such as lesser spirit totemAPG), affected allies use the skald&#146;s ability modif ier instead of their own for the purposes of this effect.</p>
			<p>If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptiveAPG, which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power&#146;s prerequisite. He may add multiple rage powers to an inspired rage at the same time using this ability (such as granting superstition and disruptive simultaneously).</p>
			<p>If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage).</p>
			<p>If the skald has rage powers from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during an inspired rage. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times.</p>
			<p>If the skald has the ability to rage from another source, he can use his skald rage powers during that rage as well.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a skald gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if he is immobilized. A skald with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
			<p>If a skald already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Thousand Totems (Su): </b>At 5th level, a war painter can channel a powerful totem into his furious paints while applying the pigments on an ally. This grants the painted ally the benefits of one additional rage power when the ally activates the furious paints. The war painter does not need to know the rage power, but it must be one for which he qualifies. Furthermore, the war painter can select only a blood rage power (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide 80) or a totem rage power (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&#146;s Guide 74). If the war painter already has a different blood rage or totem rage power that would be applied to the painted ally, this new rage power replaces it and any other rage powers that require it as a prerequisite.</p>
			<p>A war painter can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and he gains one additional use at 11th and 17th levels. He can apply this ability multiple times to the same creature, though only to give it rage powers that use the granted rage power as a prerequisite (such as beast totem and greater beast totem).</p>
			<p>This ability replaces spell kenning.</p>
			<p><b>Arcane Flourish (Su): </b>At 7th level, once per day as he finishes applying his furious paint to a creature, a war painter can cast one skald spell with a casting time of no more than 1 standard action and infuse the spell into the paint. Once while benefiting from the paint&#146;s raging song, the painted ally can use a standard action to cast the infused spell on herself as if the war painter had cast it. The spell ends when the paint&#146;s other effects end. A war painter can infuse only a skald spell whose level is at least 2 levels lower than the highest-level skald spell he can cast. He can infuse any targeted spell in a painted ally, even if its range is personal. The war painter can use this ability twice per day at 13th level and three times per day at 19th level.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces lore master.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level and higher, a skald can no longer be flanked. This defense denies enemies the ability to sneak attack the skald by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more levels in a class that grants sneak attack than the target has skald levels.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a skald gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the skald takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 14th and 19th levels, this damage reduction increases by 1. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0. Additionally, the skald grants this DR to all allies affected by his inspired rage.</p>
			<p><b>Master Skald (Su): </b>At 20th level, a skald&#146;s inspired rage no longer gives allies a penalty to AC, nor limits what skills or abilities they can use. Allies with rage class abilities may use features dependent on those abilities without restriction, such as a barbarian&#146;s rage powers and a bloodrager&#146;s blood casting and bloodline abilities. Finally, when making a full attack, affected allies may make an additional attack each round (as if using a haste effect).</p>

					<p>A skald is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor and shields (except tower shields). A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and even using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>

					<p>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>

				<level type="number">1</level>
				<name type="string">Raging Song</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
					<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
					<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>
					<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally&#146;s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald&#146;s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song&#146;s effects last for that ally&#146;s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p>
					<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p>
					<p><i>Inspired Rage (Su): </i>At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but also take a &#150;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of inspired rage, allies other than the skald cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonuses on Will saves increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn&#146;t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian&#146;s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p>
					<p>If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian&#146;s rage, bloodrager&#146;s bloodrage, or skald&#146;s inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
					<p><i>Dirge of Doom (Su): </i>At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become shaken. This only affects enemies that are within 30 feet and able to hear the skald&#146;s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance. This cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the targets are already shaken from another effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect, and relies on audible components.</p>
					<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The urban skald finds that challenging and mocking foes is sometimes more effective than inspiring uncontrolled rage in a city.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skalds are poets, historians, and keepers of lore who use their gifts for oration and song to inspire allies into a frenzied rage. They balance a violent spirit with the veneer of civilization, recording events such as heroic battles and the deeds of great leaders, enhancing these stories in the retelling to earn bloodier victories in combat. A skald&#146;s poetry is nuanced and often has multiple overlapping meanings, and he applies similar talents to emulate magic from other spellcasters.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A skald inspires his allies, and often presses forward to fight enemies in melee. Outside of combat, he&#146;s useful as a healer and scholar, less versatile but more durable than a bard.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Barbarian and bard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Skald's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (oratory, percussion, sing, string, wind) (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A skald is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor and shields (except tower shields). A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and even using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
			<p><b>Bardic Knowledge (Ex): </b>A skald adds 1/2 his class level (minimum 1) on all Knowledge skill checks, and may make all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Skalds learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;11: Skald Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Raging Song (Su): </b>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
			<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
			<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>
			<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally&#146;s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald&#146;s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song&#146;s effects last for that ally&#146;s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p>
			<p><i>Controlled Inspired Rage (Su): </i>When the urban skald inspires rage, he does not grant the normal benefits. Instead, he can apply a +2 morale bonus to his allies&#146; Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and to +6 at 16th level. The urban skald can apply the full bonus to one ability score or split the bonus between several scores in increments of 2. The choice applies to all affected allies. The controlled inspired rage grants no bonus on Will saves, imposes no penalties to AC, and does not prevent affected allies from using Intelligence-, Dexterity-, or Charisma-based skills. This alters inspired rage.</p>
			<p><i>Infuriating Mockery (Su): </i>At 3rd level, the urban skald can inspire reckless fury in one foe within 30 feet. If the foe fails a Will saving throw, it takes a &#150;2 penalty to AC and on attack rolls, cannot use any Intelligence-, Dexterity-, or Charismabased skills, and must succeed at a concentration check to cast spells (DC = 15 + spell level) for as long as it remains in range of the skald and the performance is maintained. At 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the urban skald can target an additional foe with this ability. This replaces song of marching and damage reduction.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
			<p><i>Humiliating Defamation (Su): </i>At 10th level, the urban skald can ostracize a foe. The song has one primary target, who the skald must see and name or describe. That target must attempt a Will save. On a failed save, the primary target cannot benefit from any morale bonus or teamwork feats, cannot treat any creature as an ally, and must attempt to save against any spell cast on it (including harmless spells, even if it casts them on itself ). These effects remain as long as the primary target can hear the skald and the skald maintains the performance.</p>
			<p>All other foes within 60 feet of the skald are secondary targets. Secondary targets must succeed at Will saves or they cannot treat the primary target as an ally, and cannot target it with spells or abilities that are harmless. These effects remain as long as the secondary targets are within 60 feet of the skald and the skald maintains the performance. This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect.</p>
			<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>
			<p><b>Scribe Scroll: </b>At 1st level, a skald gains Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Versatile Performance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a skald can choose one type of Perform skill associated with the skald class. He can use his bonus in that skill in place of his bonus in the associated skills listed below. When substituting in this way, the skald uses his total Perform skill bonus, including class skill bonus, in place of the associated skill&#146;s bonus, whether or not he has ranks in that skill or if it is a class skill. At 7th level, and every 5 levels thereafter, the bard can select an additional type of Perform to substitute.</p>
			<p>The types of Perform and their associated skills are: Oratory (Diplomacy, Sense Motive), Percussion (Handle Animal, Intimidate), Sing (Bluff, Sense Motive), String (Bluff, Diplomacy), and Wind (Diplomacy, Handle Animal).</p>
			<p><b>Well-Versed (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, the skald becomes resistant to sonic effects. The skald gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made against bardic performance, as well as all sonic or language-dependent effects.</p>
			<p><b>Back of the Crowd (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, an urban skald has learned to maximize the defensive benefit of being near allies. He gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC when adjacent to 2 or more allies. This bonus increases to +2 at 9th level and to +3 at 15th level.</p>
			<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex): </b>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32&#150;34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.</p>
			<p>When starting an inspired rage, the skald chooses which rage powers (if any) to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of these rage powers, using the skald&#146;s level as their effective barbarian level. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers that require a minimum barbarian level. If the rage power&#146;s effects depend on the skald&#146;s ability modif ier (such as lesser spirit totemAPG), affected allies use the skald&#146;s ability modif ier instead of their own for the purposes of this effect.</p>
			<p>If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptiveAPG, which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power&#146;s prerequisite. He may add multiple rage powers to an inspired rage at the same time using this ability (such as granting superstition and disruptive simultaneously).</p>
			<p>If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage).</p>
			<p>If the skald has rage powers from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during an inspired rage. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times.</p>
			<p>If the skald has the ability to rage from another source, he can use his skald rage powers during that rage as well.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a skald gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if he is immobilized. A skald with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
			<p>If a skald already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Spell Kenning (Su): </b>At 5th level, a skald is learned in the magic of other spellcasters, and can use his own magic to duplicate those classes&#146; spells. Once per day, a skald can cast any spell on the bard, cleric, or sorcerer/wizard spell list as if it were one of his skald spells known, expending a skald spell slot of the same spell level to cast the desired spell. Casting a spell with spell kenning always has a minimum casting time of 1 full round, regardless of the casting time of the spell.</p>
			<p>At 11th level, a skald can use this ability twice per day. At 17th level, he can use this ability three times per day.</p>
			<p><b>Lore Master (Ex): </b>At 7th level, the skald becomes a master of many different types of lore, and can choose to take 10 on any Knowledge skill check that he has ranks in. Once per day, the skald can take 20 on any Knowledge skill check as a standard action, instead of spending the normal time taking 20 requires. He can use this ability to take 20 on a Knowledge skill check twice per day at 13th level and three times per day 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level and higher, a skald can no longer be flanked. This defense denies enemies the ability to sneak attack the skald by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more levels in a class that grants sneak attack than the target has skald levels.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a skald gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the skald takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 14th and 19th levels, this damage reduction increases by 1. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0. Additionally, the skald grants this DR to all allies affected by his inspired rage.</p>
			<p><b>Master Skald (Su): </b>At 20th level, a skald&#146;s inspired rage no longer gives allies a penalty to AC, nor limits what skills or abilities they can use. Allies with rage class abilities may use features dependent on those abilities without restriction, such as a barbarian&#146;s rage powers and a bloodrager&#146;s blood casting and bloodline abilities. Finally, when making a full attack, affected allies may make an additional attack each round (as if using a haste effect).</p>

					<p>A skald is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and even using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>

					<p>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>

				<name type="string">Undying Song</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>An undying word gains the following raging songs, granting his allies the ability to withstand punishment.</p>
					<p>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
					<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
					<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>
					<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally&#146;s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald&#146;s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects.

					<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p>
					<p><i>Inspire Resilience (Su): </i>At 1st level, the undying word can grant his companions supernatural endurance. This functions as inspired rage, but it grants neither a bonus to his allies&#146; Strength nor a &#150;1 penalty to their AC.</p>
					<p>This raging song replaces inspired rage.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Defiance (Su): </i>At 6th level, an undying word can shield his allies against the environment. By expending 1 round of raging song, the undying word grants all allies within 60 feet the effects of endure elements for the next hour. The undying word must continue to perform for the remainder of the hour; otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
					<p>This raging song replaces song of strength.</p>
					<p><i>Dirge of Determination (Su): </i>At 10th level, an undying word can urge his allies within 30 feet to overcome hardships. Affected allies treat ability damage, ability drain, and penalties to ability scores as though each were 2 lower. This reduction increases to 4 at 15th level, and to 6 at 20th level. The undying word can never reduce a penalty below 0 or increase an ability score beyond its original value in this manner.</p>
					<p>This raging song replaces dirge of doom.</p>
					<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32&#150;34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).</p>
					<p>Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.</p>
					<p>When starting an inspired rage, the skald chooses which rage powers (if any) to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of these rage powers, using the skald&#146;s level as their effective barbarian level.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some who have survived the Mana Wastes cannot accept defeat, and those who have learned to speak the undying word can lend others the strength to endure.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skalds are poets, historians, and keepers of lore who use their gifts for oration and song to inspire allies into a frenzied rage. They balance a violent spirit with the veneer of civilization, recording events such as heroic battles and the deeds of great leaders, enhancing these stories in the retelling to earn bloodier victories in combat. A skald&#146;s poetry is nuanced and often has multiple overlapping meanings, and he applies similar talents to emulate magic from other spellcasters.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A skald inspires his allies, and often presses forward to fight enemies in melee. Outside of combat, he&#146;s useful as a healer and scholar, less versatile but more durable than a bard.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Barbarian and bard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Skald's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (oratory, percussion, sing, string, wind) (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A skald is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and even using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
			<p><b>Bardic Knowledge (Ex): </b>A skald adds 1/2 his class level (minimum 1) on all Knowledge skill checks, and may make all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat: </b>At 1st level and every 6 skald levels thereafter, an undying word gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. He must meet the prerequisites for the feat, and it must include Endurance as a prerequisite or be selected from the following list: Endurance, Great Fortitude, or Improved Great Fortitude.</p>
			<p>This replaces scribe scroll and lore master.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Skalds learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;11: Skald Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Undying Song (Su): </b>An undying word gains the following raging songs, granting his allies the ability to withstand punishment.</p>
			<p><b>Raging Song (Su): </b>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
			<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
			<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>
			<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally&#146;s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald&#146;s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song&#146;s effects last for that ally&#146;s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p>
			<p><i>Inspire Resilience (Su): </i>At 1st level, the undying word can grant his companions supernatural endurance. This functions as inspired rage, but it grants neither a bonus to his allies&#146; Strength nor a &#150;1 penalty to their AC.</p>
			<p>This raging song replaces inspired rage.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Defiance (Su): </i>At 6th level, an undying word can shield his allies against the environment. By expending 1 round of raging song, the undying word grants all allies within 60 feet the effects of endure elements for the next hour. The undying word must continue to perform for the remainder of the hour; otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
			<p>This raging song replaces song of strength.</p>
			<p><i>Dirge of Determination (Su): </i>At 10th level, an undying word can urge his allies within 30 feet to overcome hardships. Affected allies treat ability damage, ability drain, and penalties to ability scores as though each were 2 lower. This reduction increases to 4 at 15th level, and to 6 at 20th level. The undying word can never reduce a penalty below 0 or increase an ability score beyond its original value in this manner.</p>
			<p>This raging song replaces dirge of doom.</p>
			<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>
			<p><b>Versatile Performance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a skald can choose one type of Perform skill associated with the skald class. He can use his bonus in that skill in place of his bonus in the associated skills listed below. When substituting in this way, the skald uses his total Perform skill bonus, including class skill bonus, in place of the associated skill&#146;s bonus, whether or not he has ranks in that skill or if it is a class skill. At 7th level, and every 5 levels thereafter, the bard can select an additional type of Perform to substitute.</p>
			<p>The types of Perform and their associated skills are: Oratory (Diplomacy, Sense Motive), Percussion (Handle Animal, Intimidate), Sing (Bluff, Sense Motive), String (Bluff, Diplomacy), and Wind (Diplomacy, Handle Animal).</p>
			<p><b>Well-Versed (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, the skald becomes resistant to sonic effects. The skald gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made against bardic performance, as well as all sonic or language-dependent effects.</p>
			<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex): </b>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32&#150;34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.</p>
			<p>When starting an inspired rage, the skald chooses which rage powers (if any) to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of these rage powers, using the skald&#146;s level as their effective barbarian level. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers that require a minimum barbarian level. If the rage power&#146;s effects depend on the skald&#146;s ability modif ier (such as lesser spirit totemAPG), affected allies use the skald&#146;s ability modif ier instead of their own for the purposes of this effect.</p>
			<p>If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptiveAPG, which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power&#146;s prerequisite. He may add multiple rage powers to an inspired rage at the same time using this ability (such as granting superstition and disruptive simultaneously).</p>
			<p>If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage).</p>
			<p>If the skald has rage powers from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during an inspired rage. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times.</p>
			<p>If the skald has the ability to rage from another source, he can use his skald rage powers during that rage as well.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a skald gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if he is immobilized. A skald with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
			<p>If a skald already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance Power (Su): </b>At 5th level and every 6 skald levels thereafter, an undying word learns an additional rage power that affects him and any allies under the influence of his inspire resilience. This rage power must be selected from the following list: clear mind, energy absorption, energy resistance, flesh wound, greater energy resistance, greater guarded life, guarded life, increased damage reduction, internal fortitude, or superstition. This otherwise functions as the skald&#146;s rage powers ability.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level and higher, a skald can no longer be flanked. This defense denies enemies the ability to sneak attack the skald by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more levels in a class that grants sneak attack than the target has skald levels.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a skald gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the skald takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 14th and 19th levels, this damage reduction increases by 1. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0. Additionally, the skald grants this DR to all allies affected by his inspired rage.</p>
			<p><b>Master Skald (Su): </b>At 20th level, a skald&#146;s inspired rage no longer gives allies a penalty to AC, nor limits what skills or abilities they can use. Allies with rage class abilities may use features dependent on those abilities without restriction, such as a barbarian&#146;s rage powers and a bloodrager&#146;s blood casting and bloodline abilities. Finally, when making a full attack, affected allies may make an additional attack each round (as if using a haste effect).</p>

					<p>A skald is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and even using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>

					<p>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>

					<p><i>Inspired Devotion (Su): </i>The twilight speaker inspires fervor rather than fury. Affected allies gain a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls and a +1 morale bonus on saving throws. At 6th, 12th, and 18th levels, these bonuses increase by 1.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue.

					<p><i>Song of Understanding (Su): </i>At 6th level, a twilight speaker can use his raging song to create an aura that allows creatures to speak and understand each others&#146; languages. By expending 4 rounds of raging song, the twilight speaker creates an aura that grants him and creatures in a 60-foot spread centered on him the effects of tongues. This aura uses the skald&#146;s level as the caster level for all purposes, including duration. A twilight speaker can dismiss this aura as a standard action.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Secrecy (Su): </i>At 10th level, a twilight speaker can use his song to shroud allies from detection. Affected allies gain a bonus equal to half the twilight speaker&#146;s skald level on Stealth checks, and they can attempt such checks without cover or concealment. Song of secrecy is audible only to those affected.</p>
					<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered.

For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).</p>
					<p>Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.</p>
					<p>When starting an inspired rage, the skald chooses which rage powers (if any) to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of these rage powers, using the skald&#146;s level as their effective barbarian level. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers that require a minimum barbarian level. If the rage power&#146;s effects depend on the skald&#146;s ability modif ier (such as lesser spirit totemAPG), affected allies use the skald&#146;s ability modif ier instead of their own for the purposes of this effect.</p>
					<p>If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptiveAPG, which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power&#146;s prerequisite. He may add multiple rage powers to an inspired rage at the same time using this ability (such as granting superstition and disruptive simultaneously).</p>
					<p>If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage).</p>
					<p>If the skald has rage powers from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during an inspired rage. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times.</p>
					<p>If the skald has the ability to rage from another source, he can use his skald rage powers during that rage as well.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, a skald gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if he is immobilized. A skald with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>From the extraordinarily reclusive Snowcaster elves come the twilight speakers, who consider it a sacred duty to seek out and befriend non-elven communities. These elves travel among outsiders as envoys, diplomats, traders, and even spies as events demand. Deeply devoted to the elven goddess Findeladlara, twilight speakers wander far and wide, vigilant for threats to their homes and their people.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skalds are poets, historians, and keepers of lore who use their gifts for oration and song to inspire allies into a frenzied rage. They balance a violent spirit with the veneer of civilization, recording events such as heroic battles and the deeds of great leaders, enhancing these stories in the retelling to earn bloodier victories in combat. A skald&#146;s poetry is nuanced and often has multiple overlapping meanings, and he applies similar talents to emulate magic from other spellcasters.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A skald inspires his allies, and often presses forward to fight enemies in melee. Outside of combat, he&#146;s useful as a healer and scholar, less versatile but more durable than a bard.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Barbarian and bard.</p>
			<p><b>Race: </b>Elf Only</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Skald's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (oratory, percussion, sing, string, wind) (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A skald is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and even using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Skalds learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;11: Skald Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Devout: </b>A twilight speaker must worship the elven goddess Findeladlara, and his alignment must be within one step of chaotic good. A twilight speaker who does not meet these requirements cannot use inspired devotion or Findeladlara&#146;s blessing.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Raging Song (Su): </b>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
			<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
			<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>
			<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally&#146;s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald&#146;s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song&#146;s effects last for that ally&#146;s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p>
			<p><i>Inspired Devotion (Su): </i>The twilight speaker inspires fervor rather than fury. Affected allies gain a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls and a +1 morale bonus on saving throws. At 6th, 12th, and 18th levels, these bonuses increase by 1.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Understanding (Su): </i>At 6th level, a twilight speaker can use his raging song to create an aura that allows creatures to speak and understand each others&#146; languages. By expending 4 rounds of raging song, the twilight speaker creates an aura that grants him and creatures in a 60-foot spread centered on him the effects of tongues. This aura uses the skald&#146;s level as the caster level for all purposes, including duration. A twilight speaker can dismiss this aura as a standard action.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Secrecy (Su): </i>At 10th level, a twilight speaker can use his song to shroud allies from detection. Affected allies gain a bonus equal to half the twilight speaker&#146;s skald level on Stealth checks, and they can attempt such checks without cover or concealment. Song of secrecy is audible only to those affected.</p>
			<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>
			<p><b>Scribe Scroll: </b>At 1st level, a skald gains Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Twilight Envoy: </b>A twilight speaker gains a bonus equal to half his skald level on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Sense Motive checks.</p>
			<p><b>Community Domain: </b>At 2nd level, a twilight speaker gains the Community domain and gains the powers and spells of the domain. He treats his skald level as his cleric level, and he uses his Charisma modifier in place of his Wisdom modifier for the purposes of the domain&#146;s abilities.</p>
			<p>This replaces versatile performance and well-versed.</p>
			<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex): </b>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32&#150;34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.</p>
			<p>When starting an inspired rage, the skald chooses which rage powers (if any) to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of these rage powers, using the skald&#146;s level as their effective barbarian level. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers that require a minimum barbarian level. If the rage power&#146;s effects depend on the skald&#146;s ability modif ier (such as lesser spirit totemAPG), affected allies use the skald&#146;s ability modif ier instead of their own for the purposes of this effect.</p>
			<p>If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptiveAPG, which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power&#146;s prerequisite. He may add multiple rage powers to an inspired rage at the same time using this ability (such as granting superstition and disruptive simultaneously).</p>
			<p>If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage).</p>
			<p>If the skald has rage powers from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during an inspired rage. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times.</p>
			<p>If the skald has the ability to rage from another source, he can use his skald rage powers during that rage as well.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a skald gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if he is immobilized. A skald with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
			<p>If a skald already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Spell Kenning (Su): </b>At 5th level, a skald is learned in the magic of other spellcasters, and can use his own magic to duplicate those classes&#146; spells. Once per day, a skald can cast any spell on the bard, cleric, or sorcerer/wizard spell list as if it were one of his skald spells known, expending a skald spell slot of the same spell level to cast the desired spell. Casting a spell with spell kenning always has a minimum casting time of 1 full round, regardless of the casting time of the spell.</p>
			<p>At 11th level, a skald can use this ability twice per day. At 17th level, he can use this ability three times per day.</p>
			<p><b>Findeladlara&#146;s Blessing (Su): </b>At 7th level, once per day a twilight speaker can activate any spell trigger or spell completion item as though the spell were on the skald spell list. He can use this ability an additional time per day at 13th and 19th levels.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces lore master.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level and higher, a skald can no longer be flanked. This defense denies enemies the ability to sneak attack the skald by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more levels in a class that grants sneak attack than the target has skald levels.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a skald gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the skald takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 14th and 19th levels, this damage reduction increases by 1. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0. Additionally, the skald grants this DR to all allies affected by his inspired rage.</p>
			<p><b>Findeladlara&#146;s Hand: </b>At 20th level, the twilight speaker can use Findeladlara&#146;s blessing at will.</p>
			<p>This replaces master skald.</p>

					<p>A skald is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and even using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>

					<p>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>

				<name type="string">Raging Song</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
					<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
					<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>
					<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally&#146;s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald&#146;s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song&#146;s effects last for that ally&#146;s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p>
					<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p>
					<p><i>Inspired Rage (Su): </i>At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but also take a &#150;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of inspired rage, allies other than the skald cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonuses on Will saves increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn&#146;t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian&#146;s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p>
					<p>If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian&#146;s rage, bloodrager&#146;s bloodrage, or skald&#146;s inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
					<p><i>Dirge of Doom (Su): </i>At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become shaken. This only affects enemies that are within 30 feet and able to hear the skald&#146;s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance. This cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the targets are already shaken from another effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect, and relies on audible components.</p>
					<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>

					<p><i>Song of the Beast (Su): </i>The totemic skald grants the animal focus abilities of his totem animal (as the hunter&#146;s animal focus ability) to all allies affected by his raging song. He treats his skald level as his hunter level for determining the abilities of the animal focus (such as the improvements gained at 8th and 15th level).

					<p>If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptiveAPG, which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power&#146;s prerequisite. He may add multiple rage powers to an inspired rage at the same time using this ability (such as granting superstition and disruptive simultaneously).</p>
					<p>If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage).</p>
					<p>If the skald has rage powers from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during an inspired rage. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times.</p>
					<p>If the skald has the ability to rage from another source, he can use his skald rage powers during that rage as well.</p>

				<name type="string">Totem Empathy</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, the totemic skald can improve the attitude of animals of the same type as his totem. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person. The skald rolls 1d20 and adds his skald level and his Charisma modif ier to determine the totem empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
					<p>In addition, at 4th level, the totemic skald can cast charm animal once per day as a spell-like ability, using his skald level as his caster level and his Charisma modif ier to determine the DC. This only functions against animals that are of the same type as his totem animal (subject to GM discretion). At 8th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, he can use this ability one additional time per day.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The totemic skald forms a close connection to an animal totem. Through the power of this mystical ally, the skald can change shapes, assuming its form as his own. Additionally, the totem animal grants the skald a measure of its spiritual power that he can share with his allies.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skalds are poets, historians, and keepers of lore who use their gifts for oration and song to inspire allies into a frenzied rage. They balance a violent spirit with the veneer of civilization, recording events such as heroic battles and the deeds of great leaders, enhancing these stories in the retelling to earn bloodier victories in combat. A skald&#146;s poetry is nuanced and often has multiple overlapping meanings, and he applies similar talents to emulate magic from other spellcasters.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A skald inspires his allies, and often presses forward to fight enemies in melee. Outside of combat, he&#146;s useful as a healer and scholar, less versatile but more durable than a bard.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Barbarian and bard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Skald's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (oratory, percussion, sing, string, wind) (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A skald is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and even using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
			<p><b>Bardic Knowledge (Ex): </b>A skald adds 1/2 his class level (minimum 1) on all Knowledge skill checks, and may make all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Skalds learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;11: Skald Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Raging Song (Su): </b>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
			<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
			<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>
			<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally&#146;s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald&#146;s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song&#146;s effects last for that ally&#146;s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p>
			<p><i>Inspired Rage (Su): </i>At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but also take a &#150;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of inspired rage, allies other than the skald cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonuses on Will saves increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn&#146;t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian&#146;s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p>
			<p>If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian&#146;s rage, bloodrager&#146;s bloodrage, or skald&#146;s inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
			<p><i>Dirge of Doom (Su): </i>At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become shaken. This only affects enemies that are within 30 feet and able to hear the skald&#146;s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance. This cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the targets are already shaken from another effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect, and relies on audible components.</p>
			<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>
			<p><b>Scribe Scroll: </b>At 1st level, a skald gains Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Versatile Performance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a skald can choose one type of Perform skill associated with the skald class. He can use his bonus in that skill in place of his bonus in the associated skills listed below. When substituting in this way, the skald uses his total Perform skill bonus, including class skill bonus, in place of the associated skill&#146;s bonus, whether or not he has ranks in that skill or if it is a class skill. At 7th level, and every 5 levels thereafter, the bard can select an additional type of Perform to substitute.</p>
			<p>The types of Perform and their associated skills are: Oratory (Diplomacy, Sense Motive), Percussion (Handle Animal, Intimidate), Sing (Bluff, Sense Motive), String (Bluff, Diplomacy), and Wind (Diplomacy, Handle Animal).</p>
			<p><b>Well-Versed (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, the skald becomes resistant to sonic effects. The skald gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made against bardic performance, as well as all sonic or language-dependent effects.</p>
			<p><b>Totem (Su): </b>At 3rd level, the totemic skald chooses one animal from the hunter&#146;s animal focus list (see page 27). Once selected, this choice cannot be changed. This animal becomes the skald&#146;s personal totem animal and influences his later abilities. He gains the following rage power.</p>
			<p><i>Song of the Beast (Su): </i>The totemic skald grants the animal focus abilities of his totem animal (as the hunter&#146;s animal focus ability) to all allies affected by his raging song. He treats his skald level as his hunter level for determining the abilities of the animal focus (such as the improvements gained at 8th and 15th level). This ability replaces the rage power gained at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Totem Empathy (Ex and Sp): </b>At 4th level, the totemic skald can improve the attitude of animals of the same type as his totem. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person. The skald rolls 1d20 and adds his skald level and his Charisma modif ier to determine the totem empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>
			<p>In addition, at 4th level, the totemic skald can cast charm animal once per day as a spell-like ability, using his skald level as his caster level and his Charisma modif ier to determine the DC. This only functions against animals that are of the same type as his totem animal (subject to GM discretion). At 8th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, he can use this ability one additional time per day.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su): </b>At 5th level, a totemic skald gains the ability to wild shape into the form of a Small or Medium version of his totem animal, as the druid class feature. His effective druid level for this ability is equal to his skald level &#150; 1. He can use this ability twice per day at 11th level, and three times per day at 17th level. This doesn&#146;t allow the skald to assume other forms, such as elementals, plants, or other kinds of animals.</p>
			<p>When in animal form, the skald is treated as able to speak normally for the purpose of using raging song, but not for using other abilities that require speech (such as spellcasting). The skald uses his class level as his druid level for the purpose of qualifying for feats that affect wild shape (such as Wild SpeechUM). This ability replaces spell kenning.</p>
			<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex): </b>At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32&#150;34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.</p>
			<p>When starting an inspired rage, the skald chooses which rage powers (if any) to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of these rage powers, using the skald&#146;s level as their effective barbarian level. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers that require a minimum barbarian level. If the rage power&#146;s effects depend on the skald&#146;s ability modif ier (such as lesser spirit totemAPG), affected allies use the skald&#146;s ability modif ier instead of their own for the purposes of this effect.</p>
			<p>If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptiveAPG, which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power&#146;s prerequisite. He may add multiple rage powers to an inspired rage at the same time using this ability (such as granting superstition and disruptive simultaneously).</p>
			<p>If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage).</p>
			<p>If the skald has rage powers from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during an inspired rage. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times.</p>
			<p>If the skald has the ability to rage from another source, he can use his skald rage powers during that rage as well.</p>
			<p><b>Lore Master (Ex): </b>At 7th level, the skald becomes a master of many different types of lore, and can choose to take 10 on any Knowledge skill check that he has ranks in. Once per day, the skald can take 20 on any Knowledge skill check as a standard action, instead of spending the normal time taking 20 requires. He can use this ability to take 20 on a Knowledge skill check twice per day at 13th level and three times per day 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a skald gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the skald takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 14th and 19th levels, this damage reduction increases by 1. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0. Additionally, the skald grants this DR to all allies affected by his inspired rage.</p>
			<p><b>Master Skald (Su): </b>At 20th level, a skald&#146;s inspired rage no longer gives allies a penalty to AC, nor limits what skills or abilities they can use. Allies with rage class abilities may use features dependent on those abilities without restriction, such as a barbarian&#146;s rage powers and a bloodrager&#146;s blood casting and bloodline abilities. Finally, when making a full attack, affected allies may make an additional attack each round (as if using a haste effect).</p>

					<p>A skald is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and even using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>

					<p>When a totem channeler learns a new rage power, he can select from more than one group of totem rage powers, even though he normally could not do so. Totem rage powers grant benefits related to a theme, are organized in groups of three, and usually have the word &#147;totem&#148; in their name. When the totem channeler starts an inspired rage raging song, he can add totem rage powers from only one group at a time. He can change the group of added totem rage powers by ending the current inspired rage and starting a new one.</p>

					<p>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>

				<level type="number">1</level>
				<name type="string">Raging Song</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
					<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
					<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>
					<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally&#146;s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald&#146;s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song&#146;s effects last for that ally&#146;s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p>
					<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p>
					<p><i>Inspired Rage (Su): </i>At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but also take a &#150;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of inspired rage, allies other than the skald cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonuses on Will saves increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn&#146;t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian&#146;s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p>
					<p>If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian&#146;s rage, bloodrager&#146;s bloodrage, or skald&#146;s inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
					<p><i>Dirge of Doom (Su): </i>At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become shaken. This only affects enemies that are within 30 feet and able to hear the skald&#146;s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance. This cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the targets are already shaken from another effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect, and relies on audible components.</p>
					<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some Shoanti skalds discover deeper truths in their tribes&#146; totems. These skalds, known as totem channelers, learn how to share the totems&#146; gifts with their allies in the heat of battle.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skalds are poets, historians, and keepers of lore who use their gifts for oration and song to inspire allies into a frenzied rage. They balance a violent spirit with the veneer of civilization, recording events such as heroic battles and the deeds of great leaders, enhancing these stories in the retelling to earn bloodier victories in combat. A skald&#146;s poetry is nuanced and often has multiple overlapping meanings, and he applies similar talents to emulate magic from other spellcasters.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A skald inspires his allies, and often presses forward to fight enemies in melee. Outside of combat, he&#146;s useful as a healer and scholar, less versatile but more durable than a bard.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Barbarian and bard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Skald's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (oratory, percussion, sing, string, wind) (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A skald is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and even using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Skalds learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;11: Skald Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Raging Song (Su): </b>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
			<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
			<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>
			<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally&#146;s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald&#146;s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song&#146;s effects last for that ally&#146;s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p>
			<p><i>Inspired Rage (Su): </i>At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but also take a &#150;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of inspired rage, allies other than the skald cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonuses on Will saves increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn&#146;t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian&#146;s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p>
			<p>If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian&#146;s rage, bloodrager&#146;s bloodrage, or skald&#146;s inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
			<p><i>Dirge of Doom (Su): </i>At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become shaken. This only affects enemies that are within 30 feet and able to hear the skald&#146;s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance. This cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the targets are already shaken from another effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect, and relies on audible components.</p>
			<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>
			<p><b>Scribe Scroll: </b>At 1st level, a skald gains Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Totemic Versatility (Ex): </b>When a totem channeler learns a new rage power, he can select from more than one group of totem rage powers, even though he normally could not do so. Totem rage powers grant benefits related to a theme, are organized in groups of three, and usually have the word &#147;totem&#148; in their name. When the totem channeler starts an inspired rage raging song, he can add totem rage powers from only one group at a time. He can change the group of added totem rage powers by ending the current inspired rage and starting a new one.</p>
			<p>This replaces bardic knowledge and alters rage powers.</p>
			<p><b>Versatile Performance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a skald can choose one type of Perform skill associated with the skald class. He can use his bonus in that skill in place of his bonus in the associated skills listed below. When substituting in this way, the skald uses his total Perform skill bonus, including class skill bonus, in place of the associated skill&#146;s bonus, whether or not he has ranks in that skill or if it is a class skill. At 7th level, and every 5 levels thereafter, the bard can select an additional type of Perform to substitute.</p>
			<p>The types of Perform and their associated skills are: Oratory (Diplomacy, Sense Motive), Percussion (Handle Animal, Intimidate), Sing (Bluff, Sense Motive), String (Bluff, Diplomacy), and Wind (Diplomacy, Handle Animal).</p>
			<p><b>Well-Versed (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, the skald becomes resistant to sonic effects. The skald gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made against bardic performance, as well as all sonic or language-dependent effects.</p>
			<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex): </b>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32&#150;34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.</p>
			<p>When starting an inspired rage, the skald chooses which rage powers (if any) to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of these rage powers, using the skald&#146;s level as their effective barbarian level. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers that require a minimum barbarian level. If the rage power&#146;s effects depend on the skald&#146;s ability modif ier (such as lesser spirit totemAPG), affected allies use the skald&#146;s ability modif ier instead of their own for the purposes of this effect.</p>
			<p>If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptiveAPG, which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power&#146;s prerequisite. He may add multiple rage powers to an inspired rage at the same time using this ability (such as granting superstition and disruptive simultaneously).</p>
			<p>If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage).</p>
			<p>If the skald has rage powers from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during an inspired rage. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times.</p>
			<p>If the skald has the ability to rage from another source, he can use his skald rage powers during that rage as well.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a skald gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if he is immobilized. A skald with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
			<p>If a skald already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Tandem Totems (Ex): </b>At 5th level, when a totem channeler starts an inspired rage raging song and adds a totem rage power, he can add totem rage powers from a different group. Adding or maintaining totem rage powers from the additional group requires spending 1 additional round of raging song each round. He can activate up to two additional totem groups at 11th level and up to three additional totem groups at 17th level. He must spend 1 additional round of raging song each round for each additional totem group. If the totem channeler does not have enough rounds of raging song remaining to maintain his inspired rage, the song ends.</p>
			<p>This replaces spell kenning.</p>
			<p><b>Lore Master (Ex): </b>At 7th level, the skald becomes a master of many different types of lore, and can choose to take 10 on any Knowledge skill check that he has ranks in. Once per day, the skald can take 20 on any Knowledge skill check as a standard action, instead of spending the normal time taking 20 requires. He can use this ability to take 20 on a Knowledge skill check twice per day at 13th level and three times per day 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level and higher, a skald can no longer be flanked. This defense denies enemies the ability to sneak attack the skald by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more levels in a class that grants sneak attack than the target has skald levels.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Totem&#146;s Guidance (Su): </b>At 9th level, the totem channeler can draw strength and protection from his totem powers when he wades into battle with song on his lips. When he adds a totem rage power to his inspired rage, he and his allies gain a +1 insight bonus to AC and on saving throws for the duration of the totem channeler&#146;s raging song. At 14th level, this bonus increases to +2. This bonus applies only to the first totem rage power he applies to his inspired rage.</p>
			<p>This replaces damage reduction.</p>
			<p><b>Master Skald (Su): </b>At 20th level, a skald&#146;s inspired rage no longer gives allies a penalty to AC, nor limits what skills or abilities they can use. Allies with rage class abilities may use features dependent on those abilities without restriction, such as a barbarian&#146;s rage powers and a bloodrager&#146;s blood casting and bloodline abilities. Finally, when making a full attack, affected allies may make an additional attack each round (as if using a haste effect).</p>

					<p>A skald is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and even using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>

					<p>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>

				<level type="number">1</level>
				<name type="string">Raging Song</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
					<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
					<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>
					<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally&#146;s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald&#146;s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song&#146;s effects last for that ally&#146;s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p>
					<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p>
					<p><i>Inspired Rage (Su): </i>At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but also take a &#150;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of inspired rage, allies other than the skald cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonuses on Will saves increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn&#146;t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian&#146;s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p>
					<p>If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian&#146;s rage, bloodrager&#146;s bloodrage, or skald&#146;s inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
					<p><i>Dirge of Doom (Su): </i>At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become shaken. This only affects enemies that are within 30 feet and able to hear the skald&#146;s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance. This cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the targets are already shaken from another effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect, and relies on audible components.</p>
					<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32&#150;34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).</p>
					<p>Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32&#150;34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).</p>
					<p>Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.</p>
					<p>When starting an inspired rage, the skald chooses which rage powers (if any) to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of these rage powers, using the skald&#146;s level as their effective barbarian level. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers that require a minimum barbarian level. If the rage power&#146;s effects depend on the skald&#146;s ability modif ier (such as lesser spirit totemAPG), affected allies use the skald&#146;s ability modif ier instead of their own for the purposes of this effect.</p>
					<p>If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptiveAPG, which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power&#146;s prerequisite. He may add multiple rage powers to an inspired rage at the same time using this ability (such as granting superstition and disruptive simultaneously).</p>
					<p>If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage).</p>
					<p>If the skald has rage powers from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during an inspired rage. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times.</p>
					<p>If the skald has the ability to rage from another source, he can use his skald rage powers during that rage as well.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Qadiran sunsingers are particularly religious skalds of Sarenrae who call down their goddess&#146;s glory to fill soldiers with fire.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skalds are poets, historians, and keepers of lore who use their gifts for oration and song to inspire allies into a frenzied rage. They balance a violent spirit with the veneer of civilization, recording events such as heroic battles and the deeds of great leaders, enhancing these stories in the retelling to earn bloodier victories in combat. A skald&#146;s poetry is nuanced and often has multiple overlapping meanings, and he applies similar talents to emulate magic from other spellcasters.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A skald inspires his allies, and often presses forward to fight enemies in melee. Outside of combat, he&#146;s useful as a healer and scholar, less versatile but more durable than a bard.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>A sunsinger skald must be lawful good, neutral good, or neutral, and must worship Sarenrae.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Barbarian and bard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Skald's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (oratory, percussion, sing, string, wind) (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A skald is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and even using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
			<p><b>Bardic Knowledge (Ex): </b>A skald adds 1/2 his class level (minimum 1) on all Knowledge skill checks, and may make all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Skalds learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;11: Skald Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Raging Song (Su): </b>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
			<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
			<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>
			<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally&#146;s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald&#146;s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song&#146;s effects last for that ally&#146;s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p>
			<p><i>Inspired Rage (Su): </i>At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but also take a &#150;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of inspired rage, allies other than the skald cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonuses on Will saves increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn&#146;t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian&#146;s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p>
			<p>If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian&#146;s rage, bloodrager&#146;s bloodrage, or skald&#146;s inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
			<p><i>Dirge of Doom (Su): </i>At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become shaken. This only affects enemies that are within 30 feet and able to hear the skald&#146;s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance. This cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the targets are already shaken from another effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect, and relies on audible components.</p>
			<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>
			<p><b>Scribe Scroll: </b>At 1st level, a skald gains Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Versatile Performance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a skald can choose one type of Perform skill associated with the skald class. He can use his bonus in that skill in place of his bonus in the associated skills listed below. When substituting in this way, the skald uses his total Perform skill bonus, including class skill bonus, in place of the associated skill&#146;s bonus, whether or not he has ranks in that skill or if it is a class skill. At 7th level, and every 5 levels thereafter, the bard can select an additional type of Perform to substitute.</p>
			<p>The types of Perform and their associated skills are: Oratory (Diplomacy, Sense Motive), Percussion (Handle Animal, Intimidate), Sing (Bluff, Sense Motive), String (Bluff, Diplomacy), and Wind (Diplomacy, Handle Animal).</p>
			<p><b>Well-Versed (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, the skald becomes resistant to sonic effects. The skald gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made against bardic performance, as well as all sonic or language-dependent effects.</p>
			<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex): </b>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32&#150;34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.</p>
			<p>When starting an inspired rage, the skald chooses which rage powers (if any) to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of these rage powers, using the skald&#146;s level as their effective barbarian level. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers that require a minimum barbarian level. If the rage power&#146;s effects depend on the skald&#146;s ability modif ier (such as lesser spirit totemAPG), affected allies use the skald&#146;s ability modif ier instead of their own for the purposes of this effect.</p>
			<p>If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptiveAPG, which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power&#146;s prerequisite. He may add multiple rage powers to an inspired rage at the same time using this ability (such as granting superstition and disruptive simultaneously).</p>
			<p>If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage).</p>
			<p>If the skald has rage powers from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during an inspired rage. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times.</p>
			<p>If the skald has the ability to rage from another source, he can use his skald rage powers during that rage as well.</p>
			<p><b>Pillar of Light (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a sunsinger skald can use her raging song to call upon her goddess to imbue her with glory and make all who see it pay heed. A great beam of sunlight shines down upon the skald, casting bright light in a 30-foot radius, and allows the skald&#146;s raging song to function as the fascinate bardic performance.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces song of marching.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a skald gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if he is immobilized. A skald with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
			<p>If a skald already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Channel Solar Energy (Su): </b>At 5th level, a sunsinger skald can channel energy as a cleric once per day to heal wounds or harm undead like a good-aligned cleric. When she does so, she fills the area affected by the channeled energy with light, and can outline creatures in the area of effect as per faerie fire. The sunsinger uses her skald level as her effective cleric level when channeling positive energy. Undead who are particularly harmed by sunlight take a &#150;2 penalty on saving throws against this channeled energy, and take 1 additional point of damage per die of damage dealt by the effect.</p>
			<p>At 11th level, a sunsinger can channel energy twice per day. At 17th level, she can use this ability three times per day.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces spell kenning.</p>
			<p><b>Lore Master (Ex): </b>At 7th level, the skald becomes a master of many different types of lore, and can choose to take 10 on any Knowledge skill check that he has ranks in. Once per day, the skald can take 20 on any Knowledge skill check as a standard action, instead of spending the normal time taking 20 requires. He can use this ability to take 20 on a Knowledge skill check twice per day at 13th level and three times per day 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level and higher, a skald can no longer be flanked. This defense denies enemies the ability to sneak attack the skald by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more levels in a class that grants sneak attack than the target has skald levels.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a skald gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the skald takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 14th and 19th levels, this damage reduction increases by 1. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0. Additionally, the skald grants this DR to all allies affected by his inspired rage.</p>
			<p><b>Master Skald (Su): </b>At 20th level, a skald&#146;s inspired rage no longer gives allies a penalty to AC, nor limits what skills or abilities they can use. Allies with rage class abilities may use features dependent on those abilities without restriction, such as a barbarian&#146;s rage powers and a bloodrager&#146;s blood casting and bloodline abilities. Finally, when making a full attack, affected allies may make an additional attack each round (as if using a haste effect).</p>

					<p>A skald is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and even using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>

					<p>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>

				<name type="string">Raging Song</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
					<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
					<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>
					<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally&#146;s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald&#146;s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song&#146;s effects last for that ally&#146;s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p>
					<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p>
					<p><i>Enhance Weapons (Su): </i>At 1st level, the spell warrior can grant a +1 enhancement bonus to the weapons (including ammunition) of allies within 60 feet. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, this enhancement bonus increases by 1. The maximum bonus gained is based upon the number of weapons affected: +5 to one weapon, +4 to two weapons, +3 to three weapons, or +2 to four or more weapons. Fifty pieces of ammunition count as one weapon for this purpose. The wielder of a weapon enhanced by this raging song counts as if he were under the effect of an inspired rage raging song for all purposes involving the skald's rage powers.</p>
					<p>These bonuses can also be used to add any of the following weapon special abilities to the weapons enhanced by this ability: dancing, defending, distance, flaming, frost, ghost touch, keen, mighty cleaving, returning, shock, seeking, or speed. Adding these weapon special abilities consumes an amount of bonus equal to the special ability&#146;s cost (see Table 15&#150;9: Melee Weapon Special Abilities on page 469 of the Core Rulebook). These enhancement bonuses and special abilities overlap with any enhancements or special abilities the weapon already has, though duplicate special abilities do not stack. If an affected weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other special abilities can be.</p>
					<p>The bonus and special abilities granted by this raging song are determined when the song begins, and cannot be changed until the raging song ends and another is begun. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. This ability replaces the inspired rage raging song.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Arcane Manipulation (Su): </i>At 10th level, a spell warrior can sacrifice his own rage magic to counter an opponent&#146;s spell. When using raging song, he can counterspell as an immediate action without interrupting his raging song. However, in addition to expending a spell slot (or spell slots) to attempt to counter the opponent&#146;s spell, the skald must expend 1 round of raging song per spell level of the opponent&#146;s spell (for example, if attempting to counterspell a 3rd-level spell, the skald must expend one of his own 3rd-level spell slots and 3 rounds of raging song). This ability replaces the dirge of doom raging song.</p>
					<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The spell warrior uses his arcane knowledge rather than his rage to turn the tide of battle in favor of himself and his allies. With a clash of bracers and a sonorous chant, the Spell Warrior&#146;s song reaches out to touch the weapons of his allies, lending them arcane power. While his song does not inspire rage, he can use the power of his music to enchant the weapons of his allies and counter the spells of his foes.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skalds are poets, historians, and keepers of lore who use their gifts for oration and song to inspire allies into a frenzied rage. They balance a violent spirit with the veneer of civilization, recording events such as heroic battles and the deeds of great leaders, enhancing these stories in the retelling to earn bloodier victories in combat. A skald&#146;s poetry is nuanced and often has multiple overlapping meanings, and he applies similar talents to emulate magic from other spellcasters.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A skald inspires his allies, and often presses forward to fight enemies in melee. Outside of combat, he&#146;s useful as a healer and scholar, less versatile but more durable than a bard.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Barbarian and bard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Skald's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (oratory, percussion, sing, string, wind) (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A skald is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and even using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
			<p><b>Bardic Knowledge (Ex): </b>A skald adds 1/2 his class level (minimum 1) on all Knowledge skill checks, and may make all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Skalds learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;11: Skald Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Counterspell: </b>At 1st level, the spell warrior receives the Improved Counterspell feat as a bonus feat. This ability replaces Scribe Scroll.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Raging Song (Su): </b>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
			<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
			<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>
			<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally&#146;s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald&#146;s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song&#146;s effects last for that ally&#146;s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p>
			<p><i>Enhance Weapons (Su): </i>At 1st level, the spell warrior can grant a +1 enhancement bonus to the weapons (including ammunition) of allies within 60 feet. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, this enhancement bonus increases by 1. The maximum bonus gained is based upon the number of weapons affected: +5 to one weapon, +4 to two weapons, +3 to three weapons, or +2 to four or more weapons. Fifty pieces of ammunition count as one weapon for this purpose. The wielder of a weapon enhanced by this raging song counts as if he were under the effect of an inspired rage raging song for all purposes involving the skald's rage powers.</p>
			<p>These bonuses can also be used to add any of the following weapon special abilities to the weapons enhanced by this ability: dancing, defending, distance, flaming, frost, ghost touch, keen, mighty cleaving, returning, shock, seeking, or speed. Adding these weapon special abilities consumes an amount of bonus equal to the special ability&#146;s cost (see Table 15&#150;9: Melee Weapon Special Abilities on page 469 of the Core Rulebook). These enhancement bonuses and special abilities overlap with any enhancements or special abilities the weapon already has, though duplicate special abilities do not stack. If an affected weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other special abilities can be.</p>
			<p>The bonus and special abilities granted by this raging song are determined when the song begins, and cannot be changed until the raging song ends and another is begun. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. This ability replaces the inspired rage raging song.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Arcane Manipulation (Su): </i>At 10th level, a spell warrior can sacrifice his own rage magic to counter an opponent&#146;s spell. When using raging song, he can counterspell as an immediate action without interrupting his raging song. However, in addition to expending a spell slot (or spell slots) to attempt to counter the opponent&#146;s spell, the skald must expend 1 round of raging song per spell level of the opponent&#146;s spell (for example, if attempting to counterspell a 3rd-level spell, the skald must expend one of his own 3rd-level spell slots and 3 rounds of raging song). This ability replaces the dirge of doom raging song.</p>
			<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Song (Su): </b>A spell warrior gains the following raging song, allowing him to grant his ally&#146;s weapons enhancement bonuses and special powers.</p>
			<p><b>Versatile Performance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a skald can choose one type of Perform skill associated with the skald class. He can use his bonus in that skill in place of his bonus in the associated skills listed below. When substituting in this way, the skald uses his total Perform skill bonus, including class skill bonus, in place of the associated skill&#146;s bonus, whether or not he has ranks in that skill or if it is a class skill. At 7th level, and every 5 levels thereafter, the bard can select an additional type of Perform to substitute.</p>
			<p>The types of Perform and their associated skills are: Oratory (Diplomacy, Sense Motive), Percussion (Handle Animal, Intimidate), Sing (Bluff, Sense Motive), String (Bluff, Diplomacy), and Wind (Diplomacy, Handle Animal).</p>
			<p><b>Well-Versed (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, the skald becomes resistant to sonic effects. The skald gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made against bardic performance, as well as all sonic or language-dependent effects.</p>
			<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex): </b>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32&#150;34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.</p>
			<p>When starting an inspired rage, the skald chooses which rage powers (if any) to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of these rage powers, using the skald&#146;s level as their effective barbarian level. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers that require a minimum barbarian level. If the rage power&#146;s effects depend on the skald&#146;s ability modif ier (such as lesser spirit totemAPG), affected allies use the skald&#146;s ability modif ier instead of their own for the purposes of this effect.</p>
			<p>If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptiveAPG, which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power&#146;s prerequisite. He may add multiple rage powers to an inspired rage at the same time using this ability (such as granting superstition and disruptive simultaneously).</p>
			<p>If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage).</p>
			<p>If the skald has rage powers from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during an inspired rage. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times.</p>
			<p>If the skald has the ability to rage from another source, he can use his skald rage powers during that rage as well.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a skald gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if he is immobilized. A skald with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
			<p>If a skald already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Counterspell (Su): </b>At 5th level, the spell warrior gains increased versatility when attempting to counteract enemy spellcasting. When counterspelling, he can expend two skald spell slots of the same level or higher than the opponent&#146;s spell, regardless of the school of that spell.</p>
			<p>At 11th level, when counterspelling an opponent&#146;s spell, the spell warrior only has to expend one skald spell slot of the level of the spell being cast.</p>
			<p>At 17th level, the spell warrior gains Parry SpellAPG as a bonus feat. The skald does not have to meet the prerequisites for this feat.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces spell kenning.</p>
			<p><b>Lore Master (Ex): </b>At 7th level, the skald becomes a master of many different types of lore, and can choose to take 10 on any Knowledge skill check that he has ranks in. Once per day, the skald can take 20 on any Knowledge skill check as a standard action, instead of spending the normal time taking 20 requires. He can use this ability to take 20 on a Knowledge skill check twice per day at 13th level and three times per day 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level and higher, a skald can no longer be flanked. This defense denies enemies the ability to sneak attack the skald by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more levels in a class that grants sneak attack than the target has skald levels.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a skald gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the skald takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 14th and 19th levels, this damage reduction increases by 1. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0. Additionally, the skald grants this DR to all allies affected by his inspired rage.</p>
			<p><b>Spell Tamper (Su): </b>At 20th level, when a spell warrior successfully counterspells an opponent&#146;s spell, the opponent suffers a backlash of magical energy and takes 1d6 points of damage per spell level of the countered spell. If the opponent succeeds at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the skald&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modif ier), the damage is reduced by half. This damage is magical and is not subject to damage reduction or energy resistance. This ability replaces master skald.</p>

					<p>A skald is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and even using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>

					<p>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>

At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
					<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
					<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>
					<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally&#146;s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald&#146;s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects.

					<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p>
					<p><i>Inspired Rage (Su): </i>At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but also take a &#150;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of inspired rage, allies other than the skald cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonuses on Will saves increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn&#146;t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian&#146;s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p>
					<p>If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian&#146;s rage, bloodrager&#146;s bloodrage, or skald&#146;s inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
					<p><i>Dirge of Doom (Su): </i>At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become shaken. This only affects enemies that are within 30 feet and able to hear the skald&#146;s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance. This cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the targets are already shaken from another effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect, and relies on audible components.</p>
					<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>

The serpent herald may choose from the following aspects: movement (+8 competence bonus on Climb and Swim checks, and targets can take 10 on these checks even when rushed or threatened), scales (+2 natural armor bonus), senses (low-light vision and scent), or a natural bite attack (1d4 damage for a Medium creature plus poison [bite&#151;injury; save Fortitude DC 10 + half the serpent herald&#146;s class level + his Constitution modifier; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1 Constitution damage, cure 1 save]). This is a polymorph effect; a creature under another polymorph effect, such as wild shape, does not gain the aspect. If the serpent herald grants one of these aspects to himself, he also gains the ability to speak with animals (reptiles and creatures with the aquatic subtype only) for as long as he has the aspect.

					<p>At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32&#150;34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).</p>
					<p>Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.</p>
					<p>When starting an inspired rage, the skald chooses which rage powers (if any) to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of these rage powers, using the skald&#146;s level as their effective barbarian level. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers that require a minimum barbarian level. If the rage power&#146;s effects depend on the skald&#146;s ability modif ier (such as lesser spirit totemAPG), affected allies use the skald&#146;s ability modif ier instead of their own for the purposes of this effect.</p>
					<p>If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptiveAPG, which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power&#146;s prerequisite. He may add multiple rage powers to an inspired rage at the same time using this ability (such as granting superstition and disruptive simultaneously).</p>
					<p>If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage).</p>
					<p>If the skald has rage powers from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during an inspired rage. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times.</p>
					<p>If the skald has the ability to rage from another source, he can use his skald rage powers during that rage as well.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Warrior bands devoted to Ragadahn are often led by a serpent herald, whose deep roars shake the earth itself. Rumors tell of waves of snakes slithering forth from their nests in awe as these bellowing commanders take on serpentine features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skalds are poets, historians, and keepers of lore who use their gifts for oration and song to inspire allies into a frenzied rage. They balance a violent spirit with the veneer of civilization, recording events such as heroic battles and the deeds of great leaders, enhancing these stories in the retelling to earn bloodier victories in combat. A skald&#146;s poetry is nuanced and often has multiple overlapping meanings, and he applies similar talents to emulate magic from other spellcasters.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A skald inspires his allies, and often presses forward to fight enemies in melee. Outside of combat, he&#146;s useful as a healer and scholar, less versatile but more durable than a bard.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Barbarian and bard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Skald's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (oratory, percussion, sing, string, wind) (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A skald is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and even using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
			<p><b>Bardic Knowledge (Ex): </b>A skald adds 1/2 his class level (minimum 1) on all Knowledge skill checks, and may make all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Skalds learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;11: Skald Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Raging Song (Su): </b>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
			<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
			<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>
			<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally&#146;s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald&#146;s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song&#146;s effects last for that ally&#146;s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p>
			<p><i>Inspired Rage (Su): </i>At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but also take a &#150;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of inspired rage, allies other than the skald cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonuses on Will saves increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn&#146;t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian&#146;s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p>
			<p>If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian&#146;s rage, bloodrager&#146;s bloodrage, or skald&#146;s inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
			<p><i>Dirge of Doom (Su): </i>At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become shaken. This only affects enemies that are within 30 feet and able to hear the skald&#146;s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance. This cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the targets are already shaken from another effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect, and relies on audible components.</p>
			<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>
			<p><b>Scribe Scroll: </b>At 1st level, a skald gains Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Versatile Performance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a skald can choose one type of Perform skill associated with the skald class. He can use his bonus in that skill in place of his bonus in the associated skills listed below. When substituting in this way, the skald uses his total Perform skill bonus, including class skill bonus, in place of the associated skill&#146;s bonus, whether or not he has ranks in that skill or if it is a class skill. At 7th level, and every 5 levels thereafter, the bard can select an additional type of Perform to substitute.</p>
			<p>The types of Perform and their associated skills are: Oratory (Diplomacy, Sense Motive), Percussion (Handle Animal, Intimidate), Sing (Bluff, Sense Motive), String (Bluff, Diplomacy), and Wind (Diplomacy, Handle Animal).</p>
			<p><b>Well-Versed (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, the skald becomes resistant to sonic effects. The skald gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made against bardic performance, as well as all sonic or language-dependent effects.</p>
			<p><b>Serpentine Rage (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a serpent herald can call down Ragadahn&#146;s features onto his allies. Allies affected by the serpent herald&#146;s inspired rage ability gain a serpentine aspect of the serpent herald&#146;s choice (all affected allies gain the same aspect). The serpent herald may choose from the following aspects: movement (+8 competence bonus on Climb and Swim checks, and targets can take 10 on these checks even when rushed or threatened), scales (+2 natural armor bonus), senses (low-light vision and scent), or a natural bite attack (1d4 damage for a Medium creature plus poison [bite&#151;injury; save Fortitude DC 10 + half the serpent herald&#146;s class level + his Constitution modifier; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1 Constitution damage, cure 1 save]). This is a polymorph effect; a creature under another polymorph effect, such as wild shape, does not gain the aspect. If the serpent herald grants one of these aspects to himself, he also gains the ability to speak with animals (reptiles and creatures with the aquatic subtype only) for as long as he has the aspect. The serpent herald must have the inspired rage raging song to use this ability.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the rage power gained at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a skald gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if he is immobilized. A skald with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
			<p>If a skald already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Serpent Shape (Su): </b>At 5th level, a serpent herald gains the ability to use wild shape to take the form of a reptile or an aquatic animal once per day, as the druid class feature. His effective druid level for this ability is equal to his serpent herald level &#150; 1. This doesn&#146;t allow him to assume other forms, such as elementals or other kinds of animals. When in animal form, the serpent herald is treated as able to speak normally for the purpose of using raging song, but not for using other abilities that require speech (such as spellcasting).</p>
			<p>At 11th level, a serpent herald can use this ability twice per day and gains the benefits of the Wild SpeechUM feat while using this ability, treating his druid level as his serpent herald level &#150; 1.</p>
			<p>At 17th level, a serpent herald can use this ability three times per day. In addition, he gains the supernatural resiliency of a linnorm, gaining the effects of freedom of movement while using this ability.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces spell kenning.</p>
			<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex): </b>At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32&#150;34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.</p>
			<p>When starting an inspired rage, the skald chooses which rage powers (if any) to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of these rage powers, using the skald&#146;s level as their effective barbarian level. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers that require a minimum barbarian level. If the rage power&#146;s effects depend on the skald&#146;s ability modif ier (such as lesser spirit totemAPG), affected allies use the skald&#146;s ability modif ier instead of their own for the purposes of this effect.</p>
			<p>If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptiveAPG, which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power&#146;s prerequisite. He may add multiple rage powers to an inspired rage at the same time using this ability (such as granting superstition and disruptive simultaneously).</p>
			<p>If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage).</p>
			<p>If the skald has rage powers from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during an inspired rage. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times.</p>
			<p>If the skald has the ability to rage from another source, he can use his skald rage powers during that rage as well.</p>
			<p><b>Lore Master (Ex): </b>At 7th level, the skald becomes a master of many different types of lore, and can choose to take 10 on any Knowledge skill check that he has ranks in. Once per day, the skald can take 20 on any Knowledge skill check as a standard action, instead of spending the normal time taking 20 requires. He can use this ability to take 20 on a Knowledge skill check twice per day at 13th level and three times per day 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level and higher, a skald can no longer be flanked. This defense denies enemies the ability to sneak attack the skald by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more levels in a class that grants sneak attack than the target has skald levels.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a skald gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the skald takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 14th and 19th levels, this damage reduction increases by 1. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0. Additionally, the skald grants this DR to all allies affected by his inspired rage.</p>
			<p><b>Master Skald (Su): </b>At 20th level, a skald&#146;s inspired rage no longer gives allies a penalty to AC, nor limits what skills or abilities they can use. Allies with rage class abilities may use features dependent on those abilities without restriction, such as a barbarian&#146;s rage powers and a bloodrager&#146;s blood casting and bloodline abilities. Finally, when making a full attack, affected allies may make an additional attack each round (as if using a haste effect).</p>

Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice.

					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>

				<name type="string">Raging Song</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
					<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
					<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect.

					<p><i>Inspired Rage (Su): </i>At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but also take a &#150;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of inspired rage, allies other than the skald cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonuses on Will saves increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn&#146;t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian&#146;s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p>
					<p>If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian&#146;s rage, bloodrager&#146;s bloodrage, or skald&#146;s inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p>

					<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
					<p><i>Dirge of Doom (Su): </i>At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become shaken. This only affects enemies that are within 30 feet and able to hear the skald&#146;s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance. This cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the targets are already shaken from another effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect, and relies on audible components.</p>
					<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>

This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).</p>
					<p>Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>In the young tengu nation of Kwanlai, politicos argue endlessly over how best to rule and guide a people who have been parasites and vassals to other nations for millennia. The tengu tendency toward dramatic f lourishes and rhetoric only complicates this debate, creating an environment in which political clubs led by hot-blooded firebrands&#151;referred to as red tongues in polite company&#151;dominate the political scene by swaying emotions in the moment and wielding magic in the shadows. Many political debates in Hisuikarasu end in violent brawls or daring duels.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skalds are poets, historians, and keepers of lore who use their gifts for oration and song to inspire allies into a frenzied rage. They balance a violent spirit with the veneer of civilization, recording events such as heroic battles and the deeds of great leaders, enhancing these stories in the retelling to earn bloodier victories in combat. A skald&#146;s poetry is nuanced and often has multiple overlapping meanings, and he applies similar talents to emulate magic from other spellcasters.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A skald inspires his allies, and often presses forward to fight enemies in melee. Outside of combat, he&#146;s useful as a healer and scholar, less versatile but more durable than a bard.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Barbarian and bard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Skald's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (oratory, percussion, sing, string, wind) (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A skald is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and even using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Skalds learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;11: Skald Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Seed of Discord (Su): </b>The fiery outlook of the red tongue imparts instinctual knowledge to invest arcane energy into his proclamations and denouncements. The red tongue gains the following bonus spells known as he reaches the appropriate level to cast each spell: doomAPG (1st), castigateAPG (2nd), charm monster (3rd), denounceAPG (4th), greater command (5th), mass eagle&#146;s splendor (6th).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Raging Song (Su): </b>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
			<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
			<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>
			<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally&#146;s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald&#146;s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song&#146;s effects last for that ally&#146;s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p>
			<p><i>Inspired Rage (Su): </i>At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but also take a &#150;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of inspired rage, allies other than the skald cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonuses on Will saves increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn&#146;t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian&#146;s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p>
			<p>If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian&#146;s rage, bloodrager&#146;s bloodrage, or skald&#146;s inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
			<p><i>Dirge of Doom (Su): </i>At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become shaken. This only affects enemies that are within 30 feet and able to hear the skald&#146;s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance. This cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the targets are already shaken from another effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect, and relies on audible components.</p>
			<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>
			<p><b>Rile (Ex): </b>The red tongue is particularly skilled at provoking others to action, even when ignorant on a subject. He adds 1/2 his skald level on Bluff checks to deceive or conceal his motives and on Intimidate checks to improve a creature&#146;s attitude.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces bardic knowledge.</p>
			<p><b>Scribe Scroll: </b>At 1st level, a skald gains Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Great Orator: </b>A red tongue can activate his raging song performances only by using the Perform (oratory) skill. He must select Perform (oratory) as his versatile performance choice at 2nd level.</p>
			<p>This ability modifies the raging song and versatile performance abilities.</p>
			<p><b>Versatile Performance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a skald can choose one type of Perform skill associated with the skald class. He can use his bonus in that skill in place of his bonus in the associated skills listed below. When substituting in this way, the skald uses his total Perform skill bonus, including class skill bonus, in place of the associated skill&#146;s bonus, whether or not he has ranks in that skill or if it is a class skill. At 7th level, and every 5 levels thereafter, the bard can select an additional type of Perform to substitute.</p>
			<p>The types of Perform and their associated skills are: Oratory (Diplomacy, Sense Motive), Percussion (Handle Animal, Intimidate), Sing (Bluff, Sense Motive), String (Bluff, Diplomacy), and Wind (Diplomacy, Handle Animal).</p>
			<p><b>Well-Versed (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, the skald becomes resistant to sonic effects. The skald gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made against bardic performance, as well as all sonic or language-dependent effects.</p>
			<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex): </b>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32&#150;34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.</p>
			<p>When starting an inspired rage, the skald chooses which rage powers (if any) to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of these rage powers, using the skald&#146;s level as their effective barbarian level. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers that require a minimum barbarian level. If the rage power&#146;s effects depend on the skald&#146;s ability modif ier (such as lesser spirit totemAPG), affected allies use the skald&#146;s ability modif ier instead of their own for the purposes of this effect.</p>
			<p>If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptiveAPG, which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power&#146;s prerequisite. He may add multiple rage powers to an inspired rage at the same time using this ability (such as granting superstition and disruptive simultaneously).</p>
			<p>If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage).</p>
			<p>If the skald has rage powers from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during an inspired rage. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times.</p>
			<p>If the skald has the ability to rage from another source, he can use his skald rage powers during that rage as well.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a skald gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if he is immobilized. A skald with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
			<p>If a skald already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Spell Kenning (Su): </b>At 5th level, a skald is learned in the magic of other spellcasters, and can use his own magic to duplicate those classes&#146; spells. Once per day, a skald can cast any spell on the bard, cleric, or sorcerer/wizard spell list as if it were one of his skald spells known, expending a skald spell slot of the same spell level to cast the desired spell. Casting a spell with spell kenning always has a minimum casting time of 1 full round, regardless of the casting time of the spell.</p>
			<p>At 11th level, a skald can use this ability twice per day. At 17th level, he can use this ability three times per day.</p>
			<p><b>Duplicitous Rhetoric (Su): </b>At 7th level, when a red tongue begins a raging song, he can select a single rogue talent he knows and grant it to all creatures under the inf luence of his inspired rage. If a rogue talent is limited to a certain number of uses per day, each creature affected is limited to a single use and cannot gain additional uses from a raging song for 24 hours, even if the red tongue ends his raging song and starts again.</p>
			<p><b>Lore Master (Ex): </b>At 7th level, the skald becomes a master of many different types of lore, and can choose to take 10 on any Knowledge skill check that he has ranks in. Once per day, the skald can take 20 on any Knowledge skill check as a standard action, instead of spending the normal time taking 20 requires. He can use this ability to take 20 on a Knowledge skill check twice per day at 13th level and three times per day 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Rogue Talents (Ex): </b>At 7th level, the red tongue learns a rogue talent of his choice, treating his skald level as his rogue level. He cannot select a talent that requires or modif ies a class feature he does not have (such as sneak attack), and he must meet all other prerequisites. For every 5 skald levels beyond 7th, he gains a new rogue talent.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the versatile performance selections normally gained at 7th, 12th, and 17th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level and higher, a skald can no longer be flanked. This defense denies enemies the ability to sneak attack the skald by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more levels in a class that grants sneak attack than the target has skald levels.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a skald gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the skald takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 14th and 19th levels, this damage reduction increases by 1. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0. Additionally, the skald grants this DR to all allies affected by his inspired rage.</p>
			<p><b>Master Skald (Su): </b>At 20th level, a skald&#146;s inspired rage no longer gives allies a penalty to AC, nor limits what skills or abilities they can use. Allies with rage class abilities may use features dependent on those abilities without restriction, such as a barbarian&#146;s rage powers and a bloodrager&#146;s blood casting and bloodline abilities. Finally, when making a full attack, affected allies may make an additional attack each round (as if using a haste effect).</p>

To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice.

The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>

					<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action.

					<p><i>Inspired Rage (Su): </i>At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but also take a &#150;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of inspired rage, allies other than the skald cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonuses on Will saves increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn&#146;t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian&#146;s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p>
					<p>If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian&#146;s rage, bloodrager&#146;s bloodrage, or skald&#146;s inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Rabble-Rousing (Sp): </i>At 5th level, the instigator can perform for 1 full round and spend 4 rounds of raging song. This affects those who hear the song for up to 1 hour as per enthrall.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Riot (Sp, Su) </i>At 10th level, the instigator can fill the hearts of his listeners with hatred and rouse them into a frenzy. He can use this performance on all targets with fewer than 4 Hit Dice and a Wisdom score lower than 16 who are currently enthralled, without disrupting the enthrall effect (even if a creature succeeds at its saving throw). This ability requires a standard action to activate and costs 4 additional rounds of raging song.</p>
					<p>Enthralled creatures must each attempt a new saving throw against an effect that functions as the foster hatredOA spell, except that, unlike with the spell, the instigator is free to choose subgroups, organizations, religions, or the like regardless of the targets&#146; races. Creatures that fail the saving throw or choose to forego it also gain the effects of the instigator&#146;s raging song whenever they attack the target of their hatred, for as long as the foster hatred effect lasts; however, they do not gain the effects of the instigator&#146;s rage powers when they&#146;re under the effects of raging song in this way.</p>
					<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The instigator influences the will of the people, turning them toward his own purposes. Regardless of whether what the instigator says is true or not, he inflames emotions in others and suspends their reason. Instigators are often revolutionaries, political or otherwise, but they might also be warmongering firebrands or wicked souls who spread prejudice against others.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skalds are poets, historians, and keepers of lore who use their gifts for oration and song to inspire allies into a frenzied rage. They balance a violent spirit with the veneer of civilization, recording events such as heroic battles and the deeds of great leaders, enhancing these stories in the retelling to earn bloodier victories in combat. A skald&#146;s poetry is nuanced and often has multiple overlapping meanings, and he applies similar talents to emulate magic from other spellcasters.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A skald inspires his allies, and often presses forward to fight enemies in melee. Outside of combat, he&#146;s useful as a healer and scholar, less versatile but more durable than a bard.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Barbarian and bard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Skald's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (oratory, percussion, sing, string, wind) (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A skald is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and even using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
			<p><b>Bardic Knowledge (Ex): </b>A skald adds 1/2 his class level (minimum 1) on all Knowledge skill checks, and may make all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Skalds learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;11: Skald Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Raging Song (Su): </b>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
			<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
			<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>
			<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally&#146;s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald&#146;s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song&#146;s effects last for that ally&#146;s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p>
			<p><i>Inspired Rage (Su): </i>At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but also take a &#150;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of inspired rage, allies other than the skald cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonuses on Will saves increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn&#146;t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian&#146;s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p>
			<p>If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian&#146;s rage, bloodrager&#146;s bloodrage, or skald&#146;s inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Rabble-Rousing (Sp): </i>At 5th level, the instigator can perform for 1 full round and spend 4 rounds of raging song. This affects those who hear the song for up to 1 hour as per enthrall.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Riot (Sp, Su) </i>At 10th level, the instigator can fill the hearts of his listeners with hatred and rouse them into a frenzy. He can use this performance on all targets with fewer than 4 Hit Dice and a Wisdom score lower than 16 who are currently enthralled, without disrupting the enthrall effect (even if a creature succeeds at its saving throw). This ability requires a standard action to activate and costs 4 additional rounds of raging song.</p>
			<p>Enthralled creatures must each attempt a new saving throw against an effect that functions as the foster hatredOA spell, except that, unlike with the spell, the instigator is free to choose subgroups, organizations, religions, or the like regardless of the targets&#146; races. Creatures that fail the saving throw or choose to forego it also gain the effects of the instigator&#146;s raging song whenever they attack the target of their hatred, for as long as the foster hatred effect lasts; however, they do not gain the effects of the instigator&#146;s rage powers when they&#146;re under the effects of raging song in this way.</p>
			<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>
			<p><b>Scribe Scroll: </b>At 1st level, a skald gains Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Versatile Performance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a skald can choose one type of Perform skill associated with the skald class. He can use his bonus in that skill in place of his bonus in the associated skills listed below. When substituting in this way, the skald uses his total Perform skill bonus, including class skill bonus, in place of the associated skill&#146;s bonus, whether or not he has ranks in that skill or if it is a class skill. At 7th level, and every 5 levels thereafter, the bard can select an additional type of Perform to substitute.</p>
			<p>The types of Perform and their associated skills are: Oratory (Diplomacy, Sense Motive), Percussion (Handle Animal, Intimidate), Sing (Bluff, Sense Motive), String (Bluff, Diplomacy), and Wind (Diplomacy, Handle Animal).</p>
			<p><b>Well-Versed (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, the skald becomes resistant to sonic effects. The skald gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made against bardic performance, as well as all sonic or language-dependent effects.</p>
			<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex): </b>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32&#150;34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.</p>
			<p>When starting an inspired rage, the skald chooses which rage powers (if any) to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of these rage powers, using the skald&#146;s level as their effective barbarian level. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers that require a minimum barbarian level. If the rage power&#146;s effects depend on the skald&#146;s ability modif ier (such as lesser spirit totemAPG), affected allies use the skald&#146;s ability modif ier instead of their own for the purposes of this effect.</p>
			<p>If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptiveAPG, which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power&#146;s prerequisite. He may add multiple rage powers to an inspired rage at the same time using this ability (such as granting superstition and disruptive simultaneously).</p>
			<p>If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage).</p>
			<p>If the skald has rage powers from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during an inspired rage. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times.</p>
			<p>If the skald has the ability to rage from another source, he can use his skald rage powers during that rage as well.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a skald gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if he is immobilized. A skald with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
			<p>If a skald already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Revolutionary Heart (Su): </b>At 7th level, an instigator&#146;s tumultuous mastery of demagoguery and revolution makes it diff icult for others&#146; compulsions to sway him. Once per day, when he fails a saving throw against a compulsion effect, he can attempt another saving throw after 1 time increment (1 round if the effect is measured in rounds, 1 minute if the effect is measured in minutes, 10 minutes if the spell is measured in 10-minute increments, and so on). Every 6 skald levels thereafter, he gains an additional daily use of this ability (to a maximum of 3 per day at 19th level).</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level and higher, a skald can no longer be flanked. This defense denies enemies the ability to sneak attack the skald by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more levels in a class that grants sneak attack than the target has skald levels.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a skald gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the skald takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 14th and 19th levels, this damage reduction increases by 1. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0. Additionally, the skald grants this DR to all allies affected by his inspired rage.</p>
			<p><b>Master Skald (Su): </b>At 20th level, a skald&#146;s inspired rage no longer gives allies a penalty to AC, nor limits what skills or abilities they can use. Allies with rage class abilities may use features dependent on those abilities without restriction, such as a barbarian&#146;s rage powers and a bloodrager&#146;s blood casting and bloodline abilities. Finally, when making a full attack, affected allies may make an additional attack each round (as if using a haste effect).</p>

					<p><i>Song of the Senses (Su): </i>At 2nd level, the hunt caller&#146;s raging song unlocks animalistic senses in her allies. By spending 1 round of raging song, the hunt caller can affect all allies within 60 feet for 1 hour. The allies gain low-light vision and a +2 competence bonus on Perception and Survival checks. If an ally already has low-light vision, the range doubles. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour; otherwise, its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue.

					<p><i>Call of the Wild (Su): </i>At 6th level, the hunt caller&#146;s raging song can transform herself and her allies within 60 feet into animalistic shapes, as per beast shape I (Small animals only) at her caster level. The same transformation applies to all targets. By spending 1 round of raging song per target, the hunt caller can affect any number of allies within 60 feet for 1 hour. When in animal form, the hunt caller is treated as able to speak normally for the purpose of using raging song, but not for using other abilities that require speech (such as spellcasting). The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour; otherwise, its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song per target is expended for that hour.</p>
					<p>At 10th level, the hunt caller can instead choose a Medium animal shape. At 14th level, the hunt caller can choose shapechanger&#146;s gift or the effects of beast shape II. At 18th level, she can choose the effects of beast shape III.</p>
					<p>This raging song replaces song of strength, song of the fallen, and the rage power gained at 18th level.</p>
					<p><i>Dirge of Doom (Su): </i>At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become shaken. This only affects enemies that are within 30 feet and able to hear the skald&#146;s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance. This cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the targets are already shaken from another effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect, and relies on audible components.</p>
					<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Hunt callers are skalds whose songs draw their allies into the animal world. They can invoke the inner beasts of those who observe their supernatural performances&#151;a talent that causes many to mistake the hunt caller and her allies for lycanthropes or other shapechanging creatures.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skalds are poets, historians, and keepers of lore who use their gifts for oration and song to inspire allies into a frenzied rage. They balance a violent spirit with the veneer of civilization, recording events such as heroic battles and the deeds of great leaders, enhancing these stories in the retelling to earn bloodier victories in combat. A skald&#146;s poetry is nuanced and often has multiple overlapping meanings, and he applies similar talents to emulate magic from other spellcasters.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A skald inspires his allies, and often presses forward to fight enemies in melee. Outside of combat, he&#146;s useful as a healer and scholar, less versatile but more durable than a bard.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Barbarian and bard.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A skald is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and even using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
			<p><b>Bardic Knowledge (Ex): </b>A skald adds 1/2 his class level (minimum 1) on all Knowledge skill checks, and may make all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Skalds learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;11: Skald Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Raging Song (Su): </b>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
			<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
			<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>
			<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally&#146;s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald&#146;s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song&#146;s effects last for that ally&#146;s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p>
			<p><i>Inspired Rage (Su): </i>At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but also take a &#150;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of inspired rage, allies other than the skald cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonuses on Will saves increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn&#146;t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian&#146;s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p>
			<p>If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian&#146;s rage, bloodrager&#146;s bloodrage, or skald&#146;s inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p>
			<p><i>Song of the Senses (Su): </i>At 2nd level, the hunt caller&#146;s raging song unlocks animalistic senses in her allies. By spending 1 round of raging song, the hunt caller can affect all allies within 60 feet for 1 hour. The allies gain low-light vision and a +2 competence bonus on Perception and Survival checks. If an ally already has low-light vision, the range doubles. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour; otherwise, its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
			<p>This raging song replaces well-versed.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
			<p><i>Call of the Wild (Su): </i>At 6th level, the hunt caller&#146;s raging song can transform herself and her allies within 60 feet into animalistic shapes, as per beast shape I (Small animals only) at her caster level. The same transformation applies to all targets. By spending 1 round of raging song per target, the hunt caller can affect any number of allies within 60 feet for 1 hour. When in animal form, the hunt caller is treated as able to speak normally for the purpose of using raging song, but not for using other abilities that require speech (such as spellcasting). The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour; otherwise, its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song per target is expended for that hour.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, the hunt caller can instead choose a Medium animal shape. At 14th level, the hunt caller can choose shapechanger&#146;s gift or the effects of beast shape II. At 18th level, she can choose the effects of beast shape III.</p>
			<p>This raging song replaces song of strength, song of the fallen, and the rage power gained at 18th level.</p>
			<p><i>Dirge of Doom (Su): </i>At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become shaken. This only affects enemies that are within 30 feet and able to hear the skald&#146;s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance. This cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the targets are already shaken from another effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect, and relies on audible components.</p>
			<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>
			<p><b>Scribe Scroll: </b>At 1st level, a skald gains Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Versatile Performance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a skald can choose one type of Perform skill associated with the skald class. He can use his bonus in that skill in place of his bonus in the associated skills listed below. When substituting in this way, the skald uses his total Perform skill bonus, including class skill bonus, in place of the associated skill&#146;s bonus, whether or not he has ranks in that skill or if it is a class skill. At 7th level, and every 5 levels thereafter, the bard can select an additional type of Perform to substitute.</p>
			<p>The types of Perform and their associated skills are: Oratory (Diplomacy, Sense Motive), Percussion (Handle Animal, Intimidate), Sing (Bluff, Sense Motive), String (Bluff, Diplomacy), and Wind (Diplomacy, Handle Animal).</p>
			<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex): </b>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32&#150;34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.</p>
			<p>When starting an inspired rage, the skald chooses which rage powers (if any) to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of these rage powers, using the skald&#146;s level as their effective barbarian level. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers that require a minimum barbarian level. If the rage power&#146;s effects depend on the skald&#146;s ability modif ier (such as lesser spirit totemAPG), affected allies use the skald&#146;s ability modif ier instead of their own for the purposes of this effect.</p>
			<p>If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptiveAPG, which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power&#146;s prerequisite. He may add multiple rage powers to an inspired rage at the same time using this ability (such as granting superstition and disruptive simultaneously).</p>
			<p>If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage).</p>
			<p>If the skald has rage powers from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during an inspired rage. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times.</p>
			<p>If the skald has the ability to rage from another source, he can use his skald rage powers during that rage as well.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a skald gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if he is immobilized. A skald with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
			<p>If a skald already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Wilderness Magic (Su): </b>At 5th level and again at 11th level and 17th level, the hunt caller adds two spells of any level she can cast from the druid spell list to her class spell list and list of skald spells known.</p>
			<p><b>Inspire Scent (Ex): </b>At 6th level, the hunt caller gains the scent rage power. Her song of the senses and inspired rage raging songs both grant affected allies this rage power.</p>
			<p>This replaces the rage power gained at 6th level.</p>
			<p><b>Lore Master (Ex): </b>At 7th level, the skald becomes a master of many different types of lore, and can choose to take 10 on any Knowledge skill check that he has ranks in. Once per day, the skald can take 20 on any Knowledge skill check as a standard action, instead of spending the normal time taking 20 requires. He can use this ability to take 20 on a Knowledge skill check twice per day at 13th level and three times per day 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level and higher, a skald can no longer be flanked. This defense denies enemies the ability to sneak attack the skald by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more levels in a class that grants sneak attack than the target has skald levels.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a skald gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the skald takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 14th and 19th levels, this damage reduction increases by 1. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0. Additionally, the skald grants this DR to all allies affected by his inspired rage.</p>
			<p><b>Master Skald (Su): </b>At 20th level, a skald&#146;s inspired rage no longer gives allies a penalty to AC, nor limits what skills or abilities they can use. Allies with rage class abilities may use features dependent on those abilities without restriction, such as a barbarian&#146;s rage powers and a bloodrager&#146;s blood casting and bloodline abilities. Finally, when making a full attack, affected allies may make an additional attack each round (as if using a haste effect).</p>

					<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>
					<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally&#146;s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald&#146;s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song&#146;s effects last for that ally&#146;s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p>
					<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p>
					<p><i>Inspired Rage (Su): </i>At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but also take a &#150;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of inspired rage, allies other than the skald cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonuses on Will saves increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn&#146;t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian&#146;s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p>
					<p>If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian&#146;s rage, bloodrager&#146;s bloodrage, or skald&#146;s inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
					<p><i>Dirge of Doom (Su): </i>At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become shaken. This only affects enemies that are within 30 feet and able to hear the skald&#146;s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance. This cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the targets are already shaken from another effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect, and relies on audible components.</p>
					<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Even the loudest voice can often times be drowned out by the din of battle. Whether with the polished metal trumpet of a standing army or the crude curved animal horn of savage raiders, a herald of the horn sounds his raging song with thunderous blasts, which can bolster allies or shatter castle walls.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skalds are poets, historians, and keepers of lore who use their gifts for oration and song to inspire allies into a frenzied rage. They balance a violent spirit with the veneer of civilization, recording events such as heroic battles and the deeds of great leaders, enhancing these stories in the retelling to earn bloodier victories in combat. A skald&#146;s poetry is nuanced and often has multiple overlapping meanings, and he applies similar talents to emulate magic from other spellcasters.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A skald inspires his allies, and often presses forward to fight enemies in melee. Outside of combat, he&#146;s useful as a healer and scholar, less versatile but more durable than a bard.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Barbarian and bard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Skald's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (oratory, percussion, sing, string, wind) (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A skald is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and even using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
			<p><b>Arcane Bond (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a herald of the horn forms a powerful bond with a horn (musical instrument). This functions like an arcane bloodline sorcerer&#146;s arcane bond with an object. Like a weapon, wand, or staff, the horn must be held in one hand when the herald of the horn casts skald spells. This ability replaces Scribe Scroll.</p>
			<p><b>Bardic Knowledge (Ex): </b>A skald adds 1/2 his class level (minimum 1) on all Knowledge skill checks, and may make all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Skalds learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;11: Skald Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Raging Song (Su): </b>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
			<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
			<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>
			<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally&#146;s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald&#146;s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song&#146;s effects last for that ally&#146;s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p>
			<p><i>Inspired Rage (Su): </i>At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but also take a &#150;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of inspired rage, allies other than the skald cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonuses on Will saves increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn&#146;t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian&#146;s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p>
			<p>If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian&#146;s rage, bloodrager&#146;s bloodrage, or skald&#146;s inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
			<p><i>Dirge of Doom (Su): </i>At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become shaken. This only affects enemies that are within 30 feet and able to hear the skald&#146;s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance. This cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the targets are already shaken from another effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect, and relies on audible components.</p>
			<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>
			<p><b>Versatile Performance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a skald can choose one type of Perform skill associated with the skald class. He can use his bonus in that skill in place of his bonus in the associated skills listed below. When substituting in this way, the skald uses his total Perform skill bonus, including class skill bonus, in place of the associated skill&#146;s bonus, whether or not he has ranks in that skill or if it is a class skill. At 7th level, and every 5 levels thereafter, the bard can select an additional type of Perform to substitute.</p>
			<p>The types of Perform and their associated skills are: Oratory (Diplomacy, Sense Motive), Percussion (Handle Animal, Intimidate), Sing (Bluff, Sense Motive), String (Bluff, Diplomacy), and Wind (Diplomacy, Handle Animal).</p>
			<p><b>Well-Versed (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, the skald becomes resistant to sonic effects. The skald gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made against bardic performance, as well as all sonic or language-dependent effects.</p>
			<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex): </b>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32&#150;34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.</p>
			<p>When starting an inspired rage, the skald chooses which rage powers (if any) to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of these rage powers, using the skald&#146;s level as their effective barbarian level. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers that require a minimum barbarian level. If the rage power&#146;s effects depend on the skald&#146;s ability modif ier (such as lesser spirit totemAPG), affected allies use the skald&#146;s ability modif ier instead of their own for the purposes of this effect.</p>
			<p>If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptiveAPG, which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power&#146;s prerequisite. He may add multiple rage powers to an inspired rage at the same time using this ability (such as granting superstition and disruptive simultaneously).</p>
			<p>If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage).</p>
			<p>If the skald has rage powers from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during an inspired rage. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times.</p>
			<p>If the skald has the ability to rage from another source, he can use his skald rage powers during that rage as well.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a skald gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if he is immobilized. A skald with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
			<p>If a skald already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Rousing Retort (Su): </b>At 5th level, a herald of the horn can use raging song to free allies from enchantment effects and fear. When beginning a raging song, he can expend 4 rounds of that ability to grant all allies within 60 feet a new saving throw against an ongoing enchantment or fear effect. The allies gain a +2 bonus on this new saving throw. This ability replaces the first daily use of spell kenning gained at 5th level.</p>
			<p><b>Horn Call (Su): </b>At 7th level, a herald&#146;s horn enhances his sonic spells. If a skald spell with the sonic descriptor is cast using the horn, its DC increases by 1. These DCs increase by an additional 1 at 13th and 19th levels. This ability replaces lore master.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level and higher, a skald can no longer be flanked. This defense denies enemies the ability to sneak attack the skald by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more levels in a class that grants sneak attack than the target has skald levels.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a skald gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the skald takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 14th and 19th levels, this damage reduction increases by 1. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0. Additionally, the skald grants this DR to all allies affected by his inspired rage.</p>
			<p><b>Crumbling Blast (Su): </b>At 11th level, a herald of the horn can use his horn to create a devastating shock wave of energy. Once per day, he can sound a note on the horn that functions like a horn of blasting (DC = 10 + 1/2 the herald of the horn&#146;s level + his Charisma bonus). At 17th level, the herald of the horn can use this ability twice per day and it functions like a greater horn of blasting. Unlike an actual horn of blasting, this ability does not carry the risk of destroying the horn. This ability replaces the second and third daily uses of spell kenning gained at 11th and 17th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Master Skald (Su): </b>At 20th level, a skald&#146;s inspired rage no longer gives allies a penalty to AC, nor limits what skills or abilities they can use. Allies with rage class abilities may use features dependent on those abilities without restriction, such as a barbarian&#146;s rage powers and a bloodrager&#146;s blood casting and bloodline abilities. Finally, when making a full attack, affected allies may make an additional attack each round (as if using a haste effect).</p>

A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
					<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>
					<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally&#146;s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald&#146;s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song&#146;s effects last for that ally&#146;s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p>
					<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p>
					<p><i>Inspired Rage (Su): </i>At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but also take a &#150;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of inspired rage, allies other than the skald cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonuses on Will saves increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn&#146;t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian&#146;s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p>
					<p>If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian&#146;s rage, bloodrager&#146;s bloodrage, or skald&#146;s inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
					<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32&#150;34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage.

For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).</p>

					<p>At 20th level, the fated champion gains the ability to reweave the strands of fate. As an immediate action, he can expend 10 rounds of raging song to either reroll a saving throw or force an opponent to reroll an attack roll.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Many cultures see fate as a limit that is both stifling and unwanted, regardless of the destiny that lurks in the days and years ahead. Among cultures where skalds are the keepers of lore and wisdom, there are those who learn to read the winds of fate and take up the mantle of the fated champion, knowing and embracing their destined paths with strength borne of conviction.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skalds are poets, historians, and keepers of lore who use their gifts for oration and song to inspire allies into a frenzied rage. They balance a violent spirit with the veneer of civilization, recording events such as heroic battles and the deeds of great leaders, enhancing these stories in the retelling to earn bloodier victories in combat. A skald&#146;s poetry is nuanced and often has multiple overlapping meanings, and he applies similar talents to emulate magic from other spellcasters.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A skald inspires his allies, and often presses forward to fight enemies in melee. Outside of combat, he&#146;s useful as a healer and scholar, less versatile but more durable than a bard.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Barbarian and bard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Skald's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (oratory, percussion, sing, string, wind) (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A skald is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and even using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
			<p><b>Bardic Knowledge (Ex): </b>A skald adds 1/2 his class level (minimum 1) on all Knowledge skill checks, and may make all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Skalds learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;11: Skald Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Raging Song (Su): </b>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
			<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
			<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>
			<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally&#146;s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald&#146;s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song&#146;s effects last for that ally&#146;s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p>
			<p><i>Inspired Rage (Su): </i>At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but also take a &#150;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of inspired rage, allies other than the skald cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonuses on Will saves increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn&#146;t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian&#146;s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p>
			<p>If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian&#146;s rage, bloodrager&#146;s bloodrage, or skald&#146;s inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
			<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>
			<p><b>Scribe Scroll: </b>At 1st level, a skald gains Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Versatile Performance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a skald can choose one type of Perform skill associated with the skald class. He can use his bonus in that skill in place of his bonus in the associated skills listed below. When substituting in this way, the skald uses his total Perform skill bonus, including class skill bonus, in place of the associated skill&#146;s bonus, whether or not he has ranks in that skill or if it is a class skill. At 7th level, and every 5 levels thereafter, the bard can select an additional type of Perform to substitute.</p>
			<p>The types of Perform and their associated skills are: Oratory (Diplomacy, Sense Motive), Percussion (Handle Animal, Intimidate), Sing (Bluff, Sense Motive), String (Bluff, Diplomacy), and Wind (Diplomacy, Handle Animal).</p>
			<p><b>Watcher of the Weave (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a fated champion learns to see the tapestry of events moments before it is woven. He gains an insight bonus on initiative checks equal to 1/2 his skald level. This ability replaces well-versed.</p>
			<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex): </b>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32&#150;34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.</p>
			<p>When starting an inspired rage, the skald chooses which rage powers (if any) to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of these rage powers, using the skald&#146;s level as their effective barbarian level. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers that require a minimum barbarian level. If the rage power&#146;s effects depend on the skald&#146;s ability modif ier (such as lesser spirit totemAPG), affected allies use the skald&#146;s ability modif ier instead of their own for the purposes of this effect.</p>
			<p>If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptiveAPG, which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power&#146;s prerequisite. He may add multiple rage powers to an inspired rage at the same time using this ability (such as granting superstition and disruptive simultaneously).</p>
			<p>If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage).</p>
			<p>If the skald has rage powers from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during an inspired rage. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times.</p>
			<p>If the skald has the ability to rage from another source, he can use his skald rage powers during that rage as well.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a skald gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if he is immobilized. A skald with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
			<p>If a skald already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Far Seer (Su): </b>At 5th level, a fated champion learns a method of spell kenning that is especially suited for divining and understanding the future, but not for directly harming opponents. For the purpose of determining what level spell slot he expends when using spell kenning, the skald treats the spell level of spells that predict the future (such as augury and divination) as one spell level lower (minimum spell level 1st), and treats the spell level of spells that deal damage as one spell level higher. This alters the spell kenning class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Spell Kenning (Su): </b>At 5th level, a skald is learned in the magic of other spellcasters, and can use his own magic to duplicate those classes&#146; spells. Once per day, a skald can cast any spell on the bard, cleric, or sorcerer/wizard spell list as if it were one of his skald spells known, expending a skald spell slot of the same spell level to cast the desired spell. Casting a spell with spell kenning always has a minimum casting time of 1 full round, regardless of the casting time of the spell.</p>
			<p>At 11th level, a skald can use this ability twice per day. At 17th level, he can use this ability three times per day.</p>
			<p><b>Lore Master (Ex): </b>At 7th level, the skald becomes a master of many different types of lore, and can choose to take 10 on any Knowledge skill check that he has ranks in. Once per day, the skald can take 20 on any Knowledge skill check as a standard action, instead of spending the normal time taking 20 requires. He can use this ability to take 20 on a Knowledge skill check twice per day at 13th level and three times per day 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level and higher, a skald can no longer be flanked. This defense denies enemies the ability to sneak attack the skald by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more levels in a class that grants sneak attack than the target has skald levels.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a skald gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the skald takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 14th and 19th levels, this damage reduction increases by 1. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0. Additionally, the skald grants this DR to all allies affected by his inspired rage.</p>
			<p><b>Shield of Foresight (Su): </b>At 10th level, a fated champion&#146;s certainty of his own fate grants him the ability to stare down fear and remain unbowed. When using raging song, he is immune to fear effects, and allies affected by his raging song gain a +5 bonus on saves attempted against fear effects. This ability replaces the dirge of doom raging song.</p>
			<p><b>Not This Day (Su): </b>At 20th level, the fated champion gains the ability to reweave the strands of fate. As an immediate action, he can expend 10 rounds of raging song to either reroll a saving throw or force an opponent to reroll an attack roll. The decision to use this ability must be made before the results of the initial roll are revealed, and the champion or his opponent must take the result of the reroll. This ability replaces master skald.</p>

					<p>Skalds learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;11: Skald Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>

					<p>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>

				<name type="string">Melancholic Apparition</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>By using music, oration, and similar performances, an elegist can call forth a physical manifestation of the sorrow of his tales. This functions as a spiritualist's phantom with the despair focus. He can manifest his melancholic apparition as a standard action and dismiss it as a free action. The phantom appears adjacent to the skatd and can act immediately. The melancholic apparition is immediately dismissed if the elegist is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain the performance that keeps the phantom manifested. At 1st level, an elegist can keep his apparition manifested for a total number of rounds each day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each skald level beyond 1st, he can manifest his apparition 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
					<p>Unlike a spiritualist's phantom, a melancholic apparition can't be harbored in the elegist's consciousness. When manifested, the melancholic apparition has the same number of hit points it had when previously manifested that day. It regains all of its hit points when the elegist regains his spells for the day. If the melancholic apparition is slain, the elegist can manifest it again in the same day by spending a number of additional rounds ot'this ability equal to half his skald level (minimum 1); the melancholic apparition returns with half its normal total of hit points.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some skalds internalize the saddest and must mournful of stories, so much that they are able to manifest the emotions caused by these tales in physical form. These spirits are able to inflict the misery onto the elegist's enemies.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skalds are poets, historians, and keepers of lore who use their gifts for oration and song to inspire allies into a frenzied rage. They balance a violent spirit with the veneer of civilization, recording events such as heroic battles and the deeds of great leaders, enhancing these stories in the retelling to earn bloodier victories in combat. A skald&#146;s poetry is nuanced and often has multiple overlapping meanings, and he applies similar talents to emulate magic from other spellcasters.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A skald inspires his allies, and often presses forward to fight enemies in melee. Outside of combat, he&#146;s useful as a healer and scholar, less versatile but more durable than a bard.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Barbarian and bard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Skald's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (oratory, percussion, sing, string, wind) (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A skald is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and even using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
			<p><b>Bardic Knowledge (Ex): </b>A skald adds 1/2 his class level (minimum 1) on all Knowledge skill checks, and may make all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Skalds learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;11: Skald Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Melancholic Apparition (Su): </b>By using music, oration, and similar performances, an elegist can call forth a physical manifestation of the sorrow of his tales. This functions as a spiritualist's phantom with the despair focus. He can manifest his melancholic apparition as a standard action and dismiss it as a free action. The phantom appears adjacent to the skatd and can act immediately. The melancholic apparition is immediately dismissed if the elegist is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain the performance that keeps the phantom manifested. At 1st level, an elegist can keep his apparition manifested for a total number of rounds each day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each skald level beyond 1st, he can manifest his apparition 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
			<p>Unlike a spiritualist's phantom, a melancholic apparition can't be harbored in the elegist's consciousness. When manifested, the melancholic apparition has the same number of hit points it had when previously manifested that day. It regains all of its hit points when the elegist regains his spells for the day. If the melancholic apparition is slain, the elegist can manifest it again in the same day by spending a number of additional rounds ot'this ability equal to half his skald level (minimum 1); the melancholic apparition returns with half its normal total of hit points.</p>
			<p>This replaces raging song and all related performances. as well as rage powers.</p>
			<p><b>Scribe Scroll: </b>At 1st level, a skald gains Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Steady Hearted (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, an elegist receives a +4 bonus to saving throws against emotion effects.</p>
			<p>This replaces well-versed.</p>
			<p><b>Versatile Performance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a skald can choose one type of Perform skill associated with the skald class. He can use his bonus in that skill in place of his bonus in the associated skills listed below. When substituting in this way, the skald uses his total Perform skill bonus, including class skill bonus, in place of the associated skill&#146;s bonus, whether or not he has ranks in that skill or if it is a class skill. At 7th level, and every 5 levels thereafter, the bard can select an additional type of Perform to substitute.</p>
			<p>The types of Perform and their associated skills are: Oratory (Diplomacy, Sense Motive), Percussion (Handle Animal, Intimidate), Sing (Bluff, Sense Motive), String (Bluff, Diplomacy), and Wind (Diplomacy, Handle Animal).</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a skald gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if he is immobilized. A skald with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
			<p>If a skald already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Spell Kenning (Su): </b>At 5th level, a skald is learned in the magic of other spellcasters, and can use his own magic to duplicate those classes&#146; spells. Once per day, a skald can cast any spell on the bard, cleric, or sorcerer/wizard spell list as if it were one of his skald spells known, expending a skald spell slot of the same spell level to cast the desired spell. Casting a spell with spell kenning always has a minimum casting time of 1 full round, regardless of the casting time of the spell.</p>
			<p>At 11th level, a skald can use this ability twice per day. At 17th level, he can use this ability three times per day.</p>
			<p><b>Lore Master (Ex): </b>At 7th level, the skald becomes a master of many different types of lore, and can choose to take 10 on any Knowledge skill check that he has ranks in. Once per day, the skald can take 20 on any Knowledge skill check as a standard action, instead of spending the normal time taking 20 requires. He can use this ability to take 20 on a Knowledge skill check twice per day at 13th level and three times per day 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level and higher, a skald can no longer be flanked. This defense denies enemies the ability to sneak attack the skald by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more levels in a class that grants sneak attack than the target has skald levels.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a skald gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the skald takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 14th and 19th levels, this damage reduction increases by 1. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0. Additionally, the skald grants this DR to all allies affected by his inspired rage.</p>
			<p><b>Somber Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>The damage reduction an elegist gains at 9th level is shared by his melancholic apparition when it is manifested.</p>
			<p>This alters damage reduction.</p>
			<p><b>Master Elegist (Su): </b>At 20th level, the elegist can manifest his melancholic apparition as a swift action. If it is slain. the elegist can manifest a new phantom in the same day with no additional expenditure of rounds of the melancholic apparition ability, and the new phantom has all of its hit points.</p>

				<name type="string">Raging Song</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
					<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
					<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>
					<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally&#146;s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald&#146;s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song&#146;s effects last for that ally&#146;s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p>
					<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p>
					<p><i>Inspired Rage (Su): </i>At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but also take a &#150;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of inspired rage, allies other than the skald cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonuses on Will saves increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn&#146;t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian&#146;s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p>
					<p>If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian&#146;s rage, bloodrager&#146;s bloodrage, or skald&#146;s inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p>
					<p><i>Glorious Epic (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a dragon skald learns how to truly extol the virtues and prowess of the heroic figures in his epic tales. By performing for 10 minutes and expending 1 round of raging song, the dragon skald can inf luence opinions positively towards a heroic subject of the dragon skald&#146;s choice. If the subject of the epic attempts a Diplomacy or Intimidate check against anyone who listened to the full performance, he receives a circumstance bonus on that check equal to the Will save bonus granted by the dragon skald&#146;s inspired rage. This ability replaces song of marching.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
					<p><i>Dirge of Doom (Su): </i>At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become shaken. This only affects enemies that are within 30 feet and able to hear the skald&#146;s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance. This cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the targets are already shaken from another effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect, and relies on audible components.</p>
					<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32&#150;34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).</p>
					<p>Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.</p>
					<p>When starting an inspired rage, the skald chooses which rage powers (if any) to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of these rage powers, using the skald&#146;s level as their effective barbarian level. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers that require a minimum barbarian level. If the rage power&#146;s effects depend on the skald&#146;s ability modif ier (such as lesser spirit totemAPG), affected allies use the skald&#146;s ability modif ier instead of their own for the purposes of this effect.</p>
					<p>If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptiveAPG, which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power&#146;s prerequisite. He may add multiple rage powers to an inspired rage at the same time using this ability (such as granting superstition and disruptive simultaneously).</p>
					<p>If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage).</p>
					<p>If the skald has rage powers from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during an inspired rage. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The Ulfen prize skalds on sea raids and linnorm hunts. Dragon skald performances involve song, whistling, or blowing mighty horns, and viking sailors often talk about having a skald along to whistle up a wind or sing away the mists on the morning of a momentous raid.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skalds are poets, historians, and keepers of lore who use their gifts for oration and song to inspire allies into a frenzied rage. They balance a violent spirit with the veneer of civilization, recording events such as heroic battles and the deeds of great leaders, enhancing these stories in the retelling to earn bloodier victories in combat. A skald&#146;s poetry is nuanced and often has multiple overlapping meanings, and he applies similar talents to emulate magic from other spellcasters.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A skald inspires his allies, and often presses forward to fight enemies in melee. Outside of combat, he&#146;s useful as a healer and scholar, less versatile but more durable than a bard.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Barbarian and bard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Skald's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (oratory, percussion, sing, string, wind) (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A skald is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and even using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Skalds learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;11: Skald Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Raging Song (Su): </b>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
			<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
			<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>
			<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally&#146;s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald&#146;s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song&#146;s effects last for that ally&#146;s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p>
			<p><i>Inspired Rage (Su): </i>At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but also take a &#150;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of inspired rage, allies other than the skald cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonuses on Will saves increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn&#146;t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian&#146;s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p>
			<p>If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian&#146;s rage, bloodrager&#146;s bloodrage, or skald&#146;s inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p>
			<p><i>Glorious Epic (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a dragon skald learns how to truly extol the virtues and prowess of the heroic figures in his epic tales. By performing for 10 minutes and expending 1 round of raging song, the dragon skald can inf luence opinions positively towards a heroic subject of the dragon skald&#146;s choice. If the subject of the epic attempts a Diplomacy or Intimidate check against anyone who listened to the full performance, he receives a circumstance bonus on that check equal to the Will save bonus granted by the dragon skald&#146;s inspired rage. This ability replaces song of marching.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
			<p><i>Dirge of Doom (Su): </i>At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become shaken. This only affects enemies that are within 30 feet and able to hear the skald&#146;s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance. This cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the targets are already shaken from another effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect, and relies on audible components.</p>
			<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>
			<p><b>Sea Legs (Ex): </b>A dragon skald adds 1/2 his class level (minimum 1) on all Profession (sailor) checks, Survival checks while at sea, Acrobatics and Climb checks made while aboard a boat, and Swim checks. This ability replaces bardic knowledge.</p>
			<p><b>Wind Whistler (Su): </b>At 1st level, a dragon skald adds alter windsAPG, fog cloud, and obscuring mist to his class spell list, at the same levels the wizard gains them. He still must add these spells to his spells known as normal. This ability replaces Scribe Scroll.</p>
			<p><b>Fearless Raider (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, the dragon skald becomes resistant to fear effects. The dragon skald gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against fear effects, and DCs to affect the dragon skald with the Intimidate skill increase by 4. This ability replaces well-versed.</p>
			<p><b>Versatile Performance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a skald can choose one type of Perform skill associated with the skald class. He can use his bonus in that skill in place of his bonus in the associated skills listed below. When substituting in this way, the skald uses his total Perform skill bonus, including class skill bonus, in place of the associated skill&#146;s bonus, whether or not he has ranks in that skill or if it is a class skill. At 7th level, and every 5 levels thereafter, the bard can select an additional type of Perform to substitute.</p>
			<p>The types of Perform and their associated skills are: Oratory (Diplomacy, Sense Motive), Percussion (Handle Animal, Intimidate), Sing (Bluff, Sense Motive), String (Bluff, Diplomacy), and Wind (Diplomacy, Handle Animal).</p>
			<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex): </b>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32&#150;34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.</p>
			<p>When starting an inspired rage, the skald chooses which rage powers (if any) to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of these rage powers, using the skald&#146;s level as their effective barbarian level. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers that require a minimum barbarian level. If the rage power&#146;s effects depend on the skald&#146;s ability modif ier (such as lesser spirit totemAPG), affected allies use the skald&#146;s ability modif ier instead of their own for the purposes of this effect.</p>
			<p>If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptiveAPG, which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power&#146;s prerequisite. He may add multiple rage powers to an inspired rage at the same time using this ability (such as granting superstition and disruptive simultaneously).</p>
			<p>If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage).</p>
			<p>If the skald has rage powers from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during an inspired rage. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times.</p>
			<p>If the skald has the ability to rage from another source, he can use his skald rage powers during that rage as well.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a skald gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if he is immobilized. A skald with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
			<p>If a skald already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Spell Kenning (Su): </b>At 5th level, a skald is learned in the magic of other spellcasters, and can use his own magic to duplicate those classes&#146; spells. Once per day, a skald can cast any spell on the bard, cleric, or sorcerer/wizard spell list as if it were one of his skald spells known, expending a skald spell slot of the same spell level to cast the desired spell. Casting a spell with spell kenning always has a minimum casting time of 1 full round, regardless of the casting time of the spell.</p>
			<p>At 11th level, a skald can use this ability twice per day. At 17th level, he can use this ability three times per day.</p>
			<p><b>Lore Master (Ex): </b>At 7th level, the skald becomes a master of many different types of lore, and can choose to take 10 on any Knowledge skill check that he has ranks in. Once per day, the skald can take 20 on any Knowledge skill check as a standard action, instead of spending the normal time taking 20 requires. He can use this ability to take 20 on a Knowledge skill check twice per day at 13th level and three times per day 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level and higher, a skald can no longer be flanked. This defense denies enemies the ability to sneak attack the skald by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more levels in a class that grants sneak attack than the target has skald levels.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a skald gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the skald takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 14th and 19th levels, this damage reduction increases by 1. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0. Additionally, the skald grants this DR to all allies affected by his inspired rage.</p>
			<p><b>Master Skald (Su): </b>At 20th level, a skald&#146;s inspired rage no longer gives allies a penalty to AC, nor limits what skills or abilities they can use. Allies with rage class abilities may use features dependent on those abilities without restriction, such as a barbarian&#146;s rage powers and a bloodrager&#146;s blood casting and bloodline abilities. Finally, when making a full attack, affected allies may make an additional attack each round (as if using a haste effect).</p>

					<p>A skald is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and even using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>

					<p>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>

				<name type="string">Raging Song</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
					<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>

					<p><i>Insightful Contemplation (Su): </i>At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Intelligence and Charisma and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but they also take a &#150;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of insightful contemplation, allies other than the court poet can&#146;t use any Strength-based skills or make any physical effort that requires a Constitution check. At 4th level and every 4 skald levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonus on Will saves increases by 1; the penalty to AC doesn&#146;t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonuses to Intelligence and Charisma increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian&#146;s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p>
					<p><i>Song of Inspiration (Su): </i>At 6th level, a court poet can use raging song to inspire her allies to greater mental clarity. Once each round while the court poet uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear her can add 1/2 the court poet&#146;s skald level to a single Wisdom check or Wisdom-based skill check.</p>
					<p><i>Dirge of Doom (Su): </i>At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become shaken.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Many courts are places of artistic refinement, attracting those performers who wish to revel in an aristocratic art scene. Such artists may aim to become a darling of the court, focusing on the aesthetic requirements of a particular tradition as well as learning details about that court&#146;s history and culture. Court poets elevate the skald&#146;s love of history and poetry to an aristocratic ideal, captivating courts with complicated poetic traditions and inspiring others with their craft. Some court poets go on to create their own works, weaving their magic and force of personality into their unique performances.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skalds are poets, historians, and keepers of lore who use their gifts for oration and song to inspire allies into a frenzied rage. They balance a violent spirit with the veneer of civilization, recording events such as heroic battles and the deeds of great leaders, enhancing these stories in the retelling to earn bloodier victories in combat. A skald&#146;s poetry is nuanced and often has multiple overlapping meanings, and he applies similar talents to emulate magic from other spellcasters.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A skald inspires his allies, and often presses forward to fight enemies in melee. Outside of combat, he&#146;s useful as a healer and scholar, less versatile but more durable than a bard.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Barbarian and bard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Skald's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (oratory, percussion, sing, string, wind) (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A skald is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and even using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
			<p><b>Bardic Knowledge (Ex): </b>A skald adds 1/2 his class level (minimum 1) on all Knowledge skill checks, and may make all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Skalds learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;11: Skald Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Raging Song (Su): </b>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
			<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
			<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>
			<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally&#146;s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald&#146;s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song&#146;s effects last for that ally&#146;s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p>
			<p><i>Insightful Contemplation (Su): </i>At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Intelligence and Charisma and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but they also take a &#150;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of insightful contemplation, allies other than the court poet can&#146;t use any Strength-based skills or make any physical effort that requires a Constitution check. At 4th level and every 4 skald levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonus on Will saves increases by 1; the penalty to AC doesn&#146;t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonuses to Intelligence and Charisma increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian&#146;s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p>
			<p><i>Song of Inspiration (Su): </i>At 6th level, a court poet can use raging song to inspire her allies to greater mental clarity. Once each round while the court poet uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear her can add 1/2 the court poet&#146;s skald level to a single Wisdom check or Wisdom-based skill check.</p>
			<p><i>Dirge of Doom (Su): </i>At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become shaken. This only affects enemies that are within 30 feet and able to hear the skald&#146;s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance. This cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the targets are already shaken from another effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect, and relies on audible components.</p>
			<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>
			<p><b>Scribe Scroll: </b>At 1st level, a skald gains Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Handling the Crowd (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a court poet gains a +1 bonus to AC and on Perform checks when adjacent to two or more creatures. In addition, her movement is not impeded by crowds and she gains a bonus equal to 1/2 her skald level on Diplomacy checks to influence crowds.</p>
			<p><b>Versatile Performance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a skald can choose one type of Perform skill associated with the skald class. He can use his bonus in that skill in place of his bonus in the associated skills listed below. When substituting in this way, the skald uses his total Perform skill bonus, including class skill bonus, in place of the associated skill&#146;s bonus, whether or not he has ranks in that skill or if it is a class skill. At 7th level, and every 5 levels thereafter, the bard can select an additional type of Perform to substitute.</p>
			<p>The types of Perform and their associated skills are: Oratory (Diplomacy, Sense Motive), Percussion (Handle Animal, Intimidate), Sing (Bluff, Sense Motive), String (Bluff, Diplomacy), and Wind (Diplomacy, Handle Animal).</p>
			<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex): </b>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32&#150;34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.</p>
			<p>When starting an inspired rage, the skald chooses which rage powers (if any) to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of these rage powers, using the skald&#146;s level as their effective barbarian level. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers that require a minimum barbarian level. If the rage power&#146;s effects depend on the skald&#146;s ability modif ier (such as lesser spirit totemAPG), affected allies use the skald&#146;s ability modif ier instead of their own for the purposes of this effect.</p>
			<p>If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptiveAPG, which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power&#146;s prerequisite. He may add multiple rage powers to an inspired rage at the same time using this ability (such as granting superstition and disruptive simultaneously).</p>
			<p>If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage).</p>
			<p>If the skald has rage powers from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during an inspired rage. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times.</p>
			<p>If the skald has the ability to rage from another source, he can use his skald rage powers during that rage as well.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a skald gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if he is immobilized. A skald with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
			<p>If a skald already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Spell Kenning (Su): </b>At 5th level, a skald is learned in the magic of other spellcasters, and can use his own magic to duplicate those classes&#146; spells. Once per day, a skald can cast any spell on the bard, cleric, or sorcerer/wizard spell list as if it were one of his skald spells known, expending a skald spell slot of the same spell level to cast the desired spell. Casting a spell with spell kenning always has a minimum casting time of 1 full round, regardless of the casting time of the spell.</p>
			<p>At 11th level, a skald can use this ability twice per day. At 17th level, he can use this ability three times per day.</p>
			<p><b>Lore Master (Ex): </b>At 7th level, the skald becomes a master of many different types of lore, and can choose to take 10 on any Knowledge skill check that he has ranks in. Once per day, the skald can take 20 on any Knowledge skill check as a standard action, instead of spending the normal time taking 20 requires. He can use this ability to take 20 on a Knowledge skill check twice per day at 13th level and three times per day 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level and higher, a skald can no longer be flanked. This defense denies enemies the ability to sneak attack the skald by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more levels in a class that grants sneak attack than the target has skald levels.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a skald gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the skald takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 14th and 19th levels, this damage reduction increases by 1. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0. Additionally, the skald grants this DR to all allies affected by his inspired rage.</p>
			<p><b>Master Skald (Su): </b>At 20th level, a skald&#146;s inspired rage no longer gives allies a penalty to AC, nor limits what skills or abilities they can use. Allies with rage class abilities may use features dependent on those abilities without restriction, such as a barbarian&#146;s rage powers and a bloodrager&#146;s blood casting and bloodline abilities. Finally, when making a full attack, affected allies may make an additional attack each round (as if using a haste effect).</p>

This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes.

					<p><i>Inspired Rage (Su): </i>At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but also take a &#150;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of inspired rage, allies other than the skald cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonuses on Will saves increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn&#146;t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian&#146;s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p>
					<p>If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian&#146;s rage, bloodrager&#146;s bloodrage, or skald&#146;s inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
					<p><i>Dirge of Doom (Su): </i>At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become shaken. This only affects enemies that are within 30 feet and able to hear the skald&#146;s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance.

					<p>At 4th level, a bold schemer becomes increasingly adept at infiltration and devising cunning strategies to overcome enemy fortifications.</p>
					<p>A bold schemer can spend 8 hours observing a physical location (such as a fortress, a walled city, or perhaps even a section of an underground dungeon or cavern complex), contemplating methods to infiltrate the location and engage its defenders in battle in ways that subvert their defensive advantages.</p>
					<p>At the end of the 8 hours, the bold schemer gains a +2 insight bonus on her Bluff, Disable Device, Disguise, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth checks while in that same physical location. This bonus increases by 2 at 8th level and every 4 skald levels thereafter, to a maximum of +10 at 20th level. The bonus lasts until the bold schemer observes a new location. While observing a location, the bold schemer must fully focus her attention; any distractions, such as engaging in combat, immediately ends the observation and the bold schemer must start a new period of observing a physical location to receive the bonus.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The bold schemer combines wrath, wits, and daring to win battles and wars in unconventional ways, often through infiltration and deception. If raw force of arms is insufficient, she improvises ways to pull victory from the jaws of defeat.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skalds are poets, historians, and keepers of lore who use their gifts for oration and song to inspire allies into a frenzied rage. They balance a violent spirit with the veneer of civilization, recording events such as heroic battles and the deeds of great leaders, enhancing these stories in the retelling to earn bloodier victories in combat. A skald&#146;s poetry is nuanced and often has multiple overlapping meanings, and he applies similar talents to emulate magic from other spellcasters.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A skald inspires his allies, and often presses forward to fight enemies in melee. Outside of combat, he&#146;s useful as a healer and scholar, less versatile but more durable than a bard.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Barbarian and bard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Skald's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Disable Device (Dex), Diplomacy (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all but Arcana, Dungeoneering, Planes) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (oratory, percussion, sing, string, wind) (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p>A bold schemer gains Disable Device, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth as class skills, instead of Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (dungeoneering), and Knowledge (planes). Her bardic knowledge does not apply to those skills.</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A skald is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and even using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
			<p><b>Bardic Knowledge (Ex): </b>A skald adds 1/2 his class level (minimum 1) on all Knowledge skill checks, and may make all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Skalds learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;11: Skald Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Raging Song (Su): </b>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
			<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
			<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>
			<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally&#146;s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald&#146;s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song&#146;s effects last for that ally&#146;s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p>
			<p><i>Inspired Rage (Su): </i>At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but also take a &#150;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of inspired rage, allies other than the skald cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonuses on Will saves increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn&#146;t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian&#146;s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p>
			<p>If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian&#146;s rage, bloodrager&#146;s bloodrage, or skald&#146;s inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
			<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>
			<p><b>Scribe Scroll: </b>At 1st level, a skald gains Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Versatile Performance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a skald can choose one type of Perform skill associated with the skald class. He can use his bonus in that skill in place of his bonus in the associated skills listed below. When substituting in this way, the skald uses his total Perform skill bonus, including class skill bonus, in place of the associated skill&#146;s bonus, whether or not he has ranks in that skill or if it is a class skill. At 7th level, and every 5 levels thereafter, the bard can select an additional type of Perform to substitute.</p>
			<p>The types of Perform and their associated skills are: Oratory (Diplomacy, Sense Motive), Percussion (Handle Animal, Intimidate), Sing (Bluff, Sense Motive), String (Bluff, Diplomacy), and Wind (Diplomacy, Handle Animal).</p>
			<p><b>Well-Versed (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, the skald becomes resistant to sonic effects. The skald gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made against bardic performance, as well as all sonic or language-dependent effects.</p>
			<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex): </b>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32&#150;34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.</p>
			<p>When starting an inspired rage, the skald chooses which rage powers (if any) to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of these rage powers, using the skald&#146;s level as their effective barbarian level. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers that require a minimum barbarian level. If the rage power&#146;s effects depend on the skald&#146;s ability modif ier (such as lesser spirit totemAPG), affected allies use the skald&#146;s ability modif ier instead of their own for the purposes of this effect.</p>
			<p>If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptiveAPG, which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power&#146;s prerequisite. He may add multiple rage powers to an inspired rage at the same time using this ability (such as granting superstition and disruptive simultaneously).</p>
			<p>If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage).</p>
			<p>If the skald has rage powers from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during an inspired rage. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times.</p>
			<p>If the skald has the ability to rage from another source, he can use his skald rage powers during that rage as well.</p>
			<p><b>Skald of Twists and Turns (Su): </b>At 4th level, a bold schemer becomes increasingly adept at infiltration and devising cunning strategies to overcome enemy fortifications.</p>
			<p>A bold schemer can spend 8 hours observing a physical location (such as a fortress, a walled city, or perhaps even a section of an underground dungeon or cavern complex), contemplating methods to infiltrate the location and engage its defenders in battle in ways that subvert their defensive advantages.</p>
			<p>At the end of the 8 hours, the bold schemer gains a +2 insight bonus on her Bluff, Disable Device, Disguise, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth checks while in that same physical location. This bonus increases by 2 at 8th level and every 4 skald levels thereafter, to a maximum of +10 at 20th level. The bonus lasts until the bold schemer observes a new location. While observing a location, the bold schemer must fully focus her attention; any distractions, such as engaging in combat, immediately ends the observation and the bold schemer must start a new period of observing a physical location to receive the bonus.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces uncanny dodge, improved uncanny dodge, and damage reduction.</p>
			<p><b>Spell Kenning (Su): </b>At 5th level, a skald is learned in the magic of other spellcasters, and can use his own magic to duplicate those classes&#146; spells. Once per day, a skald can cast any spell on the bard, cleric, or sorcerer/wizard spell list as if it were one of his skald spells known, expending a skald spell slot of the same spell level to cast the desired spell. Casting a spell with spell kenning always has a minimum casting time of 1 full round, regardless of the casting time of the spell.</p>
			<p>At 11th level, a skald can use this ability twice per day. At 17th level, he can use this ability three times per day.</p>
			<p><b>Lore Master (Ex): </b>At 7th level, the skald becomes a master of many different types of lore, and can choose to take 10 on any Knowledge skill check that he has ranks in. Once per day, the skald can take 20 on any Knowledge skill check as a standard action, instead of spending the normal time taking 20 requires. He can use this ability to take 20 on a Knowledge skill check twice per day at 13th level and three times per day 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a skald gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the skald takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 14th and 19th levels, this damage reduction increases by 1. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0. Additionally, the skald grants this DR to all allies affected by his inspired rage.</p>
			<p><b>Bold Strategy (Su): </b>At 10th level, a bold schemer can tailor her plans and observations so they are able to assist her allies as well. As long as they can see or hear the bold schemer while inside the observed location, all of her allies gain half the insight bonus she gains from the skald of twists and turns ability.</p>
			<p><b>Master Skald (Su): </b>At 20th level, a skald&#146;s inspired rage no longer gives allies a penalty to AC, nor limits what skills or abilities they can use. Allies with rage class abilities may use features dependent on those abilities without restriction, such as a barbarian&#146;s rage powers and a bloodrager&#146;s blood casting and bloodline abilities. Finally, when making a full attack, affected allies may make an additional attack each round (as if using a haste effect).</p>

					<p><i>Song of Endurance (Su): </i>At 3rd level, the boaster&#146;s raging song can inspire his allies to great feats of endurance. This raging song functions as song of marching except affected allies also gain the benefits of the Endurance feat in addition to the benefits of any of the following feats the boaster has (even if they don&#146;t meet the prerequisites): Deathless Initiate, Deathless Master, Deathless Zealot, Diehard, Fast Healer, Heroic Defiance, and Heroic Recovery.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Surmounting (Su): </i>At 7th level, the boaster&#146;s raging song can inspire allies to move quickly and easily. By spending 1 round of raging song, the boaster can affect all allies within 90 feet for 1 hour. Affected allies gain a benefit according to the surrounding terrain (the benefits don&#146;t stack): a climb speed equal to half their base speed (forest, jungle, mountain, underground), a swim speed equal to their base speed (swamp, water), or a +10 foot enhancement bonus to their base speed (cold, desert, hill, plains, or urban). The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour; otherwise, its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour. At 13th level, the speed or bonus granted by this ability doubles. At 19th level, this ability grants triple the listed speed or bonus.</p>
					<p><i>Dirge of Doom (Su): </i>At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become shaken. This only affects enemies that are within 30 feet and able to hear the skald&#146;s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance. This cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the targets are already shaken from another effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect, and relies on audible components.</p>
					<p><i>Frightful Boast (Su): </i>At 14th level, the boaster&#146;s raging song can frighten foes, as per the frightening tune bardic performance.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Boasters use incredible tales and claims to challenge themselves and their allies to accomplish remarkable feats. With a properly delivered boast, a boaster can inspire listeners to attempt, and more often than not, succeed at stunts or tasks they may not have realized they were capable of doing.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skalds are poets, historians, and keepers of lore who use their gifts for oration and song to inspire allies into a frenzied rage. They balance a violent spirit with the veneer of civilization, recording events such as heroic battles and the deeds of great leaders, enhancing these stories in the retelling to earn bloodier victories in combat. A skald&#146;s poetry is nuanced and often has multiple overlapping meanings, and he applies similar talents to emulate magic from other spellcasters.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A skald inspires his allies, and often presses forward to fight enemies in melee. Outside of combat, he&#146;s useful as a healer and scholar, less versatile but more durable than a bard.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Barbarian and bard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Skald's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (oratory, percussion, sing, string, wind) (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A skald is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and even using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
			<p><b>Bardic Knowledge (Ex): </b>A skald adds 1/2 his class level (minimum 1) on all Knowledge skill checks, and may make all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Skalds learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;11: Skald Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Endurance: </b>The boaster gains Endurance as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Raging Song (Su): </b>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
			<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
			<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>
			<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally&#146;s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald&#146;s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song&#146;s effects last for that ally&#146;s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p>
			<p><i>Inspired Rage (Su): </i>At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but also take a &#150;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of inspired rage, allies other than the skald cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonuses on Will saves increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn&#146;t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian&#146;s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p>
			<p>If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian&#146;s rage, bloodrager&#146;s bloodrage, or skald&#146;s inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Endurance (Su): </i>At 3rd level, the boaster&#146;s raging song can inspire his allies to great feats of endurance. This raging song functions as song of marching except affected allies also gain the benefits of the Endurance feat in addition to the benefits of any of the following feats the boaster has (even if they don&#146;t meet the prerequisites): Deathless Initiate, Deathless Master, Deathless Zealot, Diehard, Fast Healer, Heroic Defiance, and Heroic Recovery.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Surmounting (Su): </i>At 7th level, the boaster&#146;s raging song can inspire allies to move quickly and easily. By spending 1 round of raging song, the boaster can affect all allies within 90 feet for 1 hour. Affected allies gain a benefit according to the surrounding terrain (the benefits don&#146;t stack): a climb speed equal to half their base speed (forest, jungle, mountain, underground), a swim speed equal to their base speed (swamp, water), or a +10 foot enhancement bonus to their base speed (cold, desert, hill, plains, or urban). The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour; otherwise, its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour. At 13th level, the speed or bonus granted by this ability doubles. At 19th level, this ability grants triple the listed speed or bonus.</p>
			<p><i>Dirge of Doom (Su): </i>At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become shaken. This only affects enemies that are within 30 feet and able to hear the skald&#146;s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance. This cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the targets are already shaken from another effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect, and relies on audible components.</p>
			<p><i>Frightful Boast (Su): </i>At 14th level, the boaster&#146;s raging song can frighten foes, as per the frightening tune bardic performance.</p>
			<p><b>Versatile Performance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a skald can choose one type of Perform skill associated with the skald class. He can use his bonus in that skill in place of his bonus in the associated skills listed below. When substituting in this way, the skald uses his total Perform skill bonus, including class skill bonus, in place of the associated skill&#146;s bonus, whether or not he has ranks in that skill or if it is a class skill. At 7th level, and every 5 levels thereafter, the bard can select an additional type of Perform to substitute.</p>
			<p>The types of Perform and their associated skills are: Oratory (Diplomacy, Sense Motive), Percussion (Handle Animal, Intimidate), Sing (Bluff, Sense Motive), String (Bluff, Diplomacy), and Wind (Diplomacy, Handle Animal).</p>
			<p><b>Well-Versed (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, the skald becomes resistant to sonic effects. The skald gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made against bardic performance, as well as all sonic or language-dependent effects.</p>
			<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex): </b>The boaster does not gain this ability until 4th level.</p>
			<p>At 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32&#150;34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.</p>
			<p>When starting an inspired rage, the skald chooses which rage powers (if any) to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of these rage powers, using the skald&#146;s level as their effective barbarian level. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers that require a minimum barbarian level. If the rage power&#146;s effects depend on the skald&#146;s ability modif ier (such as lesser spirit totemAPG), affected allies use the skald&#146;s ability modif ier instead of their own for the purposes of this effect.</p>
			<p>If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptiveAPG, which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power&#146;s prerequisite. He may add multiple rage powers to an inspired rage at the same time using this ability (such as granting superstition and disruptive simultaneously).</p>
			<p>If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage).</p>
			<p>If the skald has rage powers from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during an inspired rage. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times.</p>
			<p>If the skald has the ability to rage from another source, he can use his skald rage powers during that rage as well.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a skald gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if he is immobilized. A skald with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
			<p>If a skald already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Spell Kenning (Su): </b>At 5th level, a skald is learned in the magic of other spellcasters, and can use his own magic to duplicate those classes&#146; spells. Once per day, a skald can cast any spell on the bard, cleric, or sorcerer/wizard spell list as if it were one of his skald spells known, expending a skald spell slot of the same spell level to cast the desired spell. Casting a spell with spell kenning always has a minimum casting time of 1 full round, regardless of the casting time of the spell.</p>
			<p>At 11th level, a skald can use this ability twice per day. At 17th level, he can use this ability three times per day.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Endurance: </b>At 6th level, the boaster gains a bonus feat that he qualifies for. The feat must have Endurance as a prerequisite (such as Diehard or Fast Healer).</p>
			<p>This replaces the rage power gained at 6th level.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level and higher, a skald can no longer be flanked. This defense denies enemies the ability to sneak attack the skald by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more levels in a class that grants sneak attack than the target has skald levels.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a skald gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the skald takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 14th and 19th levels, this damage reduction increases by 1. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0. Additionally, the skald grants this DR to all allies affected by his inspired rage.</p>
			<p><b>Master Skald (Su): </b>At 20th level, a skald&#146;s inspired rage no longer gives allies a penalty to AC, nor limits what skills or abilities they can use. Allies with rage class abilities may use features dependent on those abilities without restriction, such as a barbarian&#146;s rage powers and a bloodrager&#146;s blood casting and bloodline abilities. Finally, when making a full attack, affected allies may make an additional attack each round (as if using a haste effect).</p>

					<p>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>

					<p><i>Siege Drums (Su): </i>At 7th level, the Belkzen war drummer can shatter massive walls, doors, and other inanimate obstacles using his war drums. This ability works as the shatter spell, except the drummer can increase the amount of damage and size of the object damaged by playing for longer periods. The siege drummer can affect objects weighing up to 10 pounds per level, plus an additional 5 pounds per level for each additional round he plays. The damage dealt increases by 2d6 per round (to a maximum of 20d6 after 10 rounds). The damage is dealt only after the drummer ceases playing. This ability replaces the versatile performance gained benefit at 7th level.</p>
					<p><i>Inspired Rage (Su): </i>At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but also take a &#150;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of inspired rage, allies other than the skald cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonuses on Will saves increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn&#146;t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian&#146;s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p>
					<p>If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian&#146;s rage, bloodrager&#146;s bloodrage, or skald&#146;s inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
					<p><i>Dirge of Doom (Su): </i>At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become shaken. This only affects enemies that are within 30 feet and able to hear the skald&#146;s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance.

This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect, and relies on audible components.</p>
					<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>

					<p>If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptiveAPG, which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power&#146;s prerequisite. He may add multiple rage powers to an inspired rage at the same time using this ability (such as granting superstition and disruptive simultaneously).</p>
					<p>If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage).</p>
					<p>If the skald has rage powers from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during an inspired rage. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times.</p>
					<p>If the skald has the ability to rage from another source, he can use his skald rage powers during that rage as well.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>These fierce drummers are equally adept at tapping out a driving rhythm and rapping enemies upside the head with the same massive clubs they use to beat the crude hidecovered drums they carry into battle.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skalds are poets, historians, and keepers of lore who use their gifts for oration and song to inspire allies into a frenzied rage. They balance a violent spirit with the veneer of civilization, recording events such as heroic battles and the deeds of great leaders, enhancing these stories in the retelling to earn bloodier victories in combat. A skald&#146;s poetry is nuanced and often has multiple overlapping meanings, and he applies similar talents to emulate magic from other spellcasters.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A skald inspires his allies, and often presses forward to fight enemies in melee. Outside of combat, he&#146;s useful as a healer and scholar, less versatile but more durable than a bard.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Barbarian and bard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Skald's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (oratory, percussion, sing, string, wind) (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A war drummer is proficient with all simple weapons and the greatclub, light and medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).

This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Skalds learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;11: Skald Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Deadly Rhythm (Ex): </b>At 1st level, during his raging song, a Belkzen war drummer can draw clubs and greatclubs as a free action as if he had the Quick Draw feat. At 3rd level, the war drummer gains a +1 bonus on damage rolls for attacks made with clubs or greatclubs. At 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1 (to a maximum of +5). At 6th level, the war drummer gains Improved Critical with the club or the greatclub as a bonus feat. This ability replaces Scribe Scroll.</p>
			<p><b>Fearsome Mien (Ex): </b>A war drummer adds 1/2 his class level (minimum 1) to all Intimidate and Bluff skill checks. This ability replaces bardic knowledge.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Raging Song (Su): </b>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
			<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
			<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>
			<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally&#146;s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald&#146;s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song&#146;s effects last for that ally&#146;s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p>
			<p><i>Siege Drums (Su): </i>At 7th level, the Belkzen war drummer can shatter massive walls, doors, and other inanimate obstacles using his war drums. This ability works as the shatter spell, except the drummer can increase the amount of damage and size of the object damaged by playing for longer periods. The siege drummer can affect objects weighing up to 10 pounds per level, plus an additional 5 pounds per level for each additional round he plays. The damage dealt increases by 2d6 per round (to a maximum of 20d6 after 10 rounds). The damage is dealt only after the drummer ceases playing. This ability replaces the versatile performance gained benefit at 7th level.</p>
			<p><i>Inspired Rage (Su): </i>At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but also take a &#150;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of inspired rage, allies other than the skald cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonuses on Will saves increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn&#146;t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian&#146;s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p>
			<p>If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian&#146;s rage, bloodrager&#146;s bloodrage, or skald&#146;s inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
			<p><i>Dirge of Doom (Su): </i>At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become shaken. This only affects enemies that are within 30 feet and able to hear the skald&#146;s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance. This cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the targets are already shaken from another effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect, and relies on audible components.</p>
			<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>
			<p><b>Versatile Performance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a skald can choose one type of Perform skill associated with the skald class. He can use his bonus in that skill in place of his bonus in the associated skills listed below. When substituting in this way, the skald uses his total Perform skill bonus, including class skill bonus, in place of the associated skill&#146;s bonus, whether or not he has ranks in that skill or if it is a class skill. At 7th level, and every 5 levels thereafter, the bard can select an additional type of Perform to substitute.</p>
			<p>The types of Perform and their associated skills are: Oratory (Diplomacy, Sense Motive), Percussion (Handle Animal, Intimidate), Sing (Bluff, Sense Motive), String (Bluff, Diplomacy), and Wind (Diplomacy, Handle Animal).</p>
			<p><b>Well-Versed (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, the skald becomes resistant to sonic effects. The skald gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made against bardic performance, as well as all sonic or language-dependent effects.</p>
			<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex): </b>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32&#150;34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.</p>
			<p>When starting an inspired rage, the skald chooses which rage powers (if any) to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of these rage powers, using the skald&#146;s level as their effective barbarian level. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers that require a minimum barbarian level. If the rage power&#146;s effects depend on the skald&#146;s ability modif ier (such as lesser spirit totemAPG), affected allies use the skald&#146;s ability modif ier instead of their own for the purposes of this effect.</p>
			<p>If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptiveAPG, which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power&#146;s prerequisite. He may add multiple rage powers to an inspired rage at the same time using this ability (such as granting superstition and disruptive simultaneously).</p>
			<p>If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage).</p>
			<p>If the skald has rage powers from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during an inspired rage. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times.</p>
			<p>If the skald has the ability to rage from another source, he can use his skald rage powers during that rage as well.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a skald gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if he is immobilized. A skald with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
			<p>If a skald already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Spell Kenning (Su): </b>At 5th level, a skald is learned in the magic of other spellcasters, and can use his own magic to duplicate those classes&#146; spells. Once per day, a skald can cast any spell on the bard, cleric, or sorcerer/wizard spell list as if it were one of his skald spells known, expending a skald spell slot of the same spell level to cast the desired spell. Casting a spell with spell kenning always has a minimum casting time of 1 full round, regardless of the casting time of the spell.</p>
			<p>At 11th level, a skald can use this ability twice per day. At 17th level, he can use this ability three times per day.</p>
			<p><b>Weapon Master (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a war drummer gains Craft Magic Arms and Armor as a bonus feat. This ability replaces lore master.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level and higher, a skald can no longer be flanked. This defense denies enemies the ability to sneak attack the skald by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more levels in a class that grants sneak attack than the target has skald levels.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a skald gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the skald takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 14th and 19th levels, this damage reduction increases by 1. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0. Additionally, the skald grants this DR to all allies affected by his inspired rage.</p>
			<p><b>Master Skald (Su): </b>At 20th level, a skald&#146;s inspired rage no longer gives allies a penalty to AC, nor limits what skills or abilities they can use. Allies with rage class abilities may use features dependent on those abilities without restriction, such as a barbarian&#146;s rage powers and a bloodrager&#146;s blood casting and bloodline abilities. Finally, when making a full attack, affected allies may make an additional attack each round (as if using a haste effect).</p>

					<p>At 3rd level, whenever a Bekyar demon dancer inspires rage, all who accept his rage gain a bite attack dealing 1d6 points of damage (for Medium allies; 1d4 points of damage if Small). This damage increases to 1d8 (1d6 if Small) at 7th level, to 2d6 (1d8 if Small) at 12th level, and to 3d6 (2d6 if Small) at 17th level.

If used as part of a full attack action, the bite attack is made at the creature&#146;s full base attack bonus &#150; 5. This ability replaces the rage power gained at 3rd level.</p>

					<p>At 7th level, the Bekyar demon dancer&#146;s dances warp the minds of those who accept them even further. Whenever anyone affected by his inspired rage makes an attack against a creature, the urge to dominate this foe rises within the affected ally. The ally can attempt to resist this urge with a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the skald&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier). If she fails the save or chooses not to attempt one, the Strength and Constitution bonuses of the demon dancer&#146;s inspire rage increase by 2, and she must continue to attack the same target each round. Once the target is defeated, she must burn or cut the symbol of a demon the Bekyar demon dancer worships into the target&#146;s flesh, which is a full-round action. The need to conquer and brand foes ends after this action or after the demon dancer stops performing, whichever comes first.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32&#150;34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).</p>
					<p>Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.</p>
					<p>When starting an inspired rage, the skald chooses which rage powers (if any) to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of these rage powers, using the skald&#146;s level as their effective barbarian level. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers that require a minimum barbarian level. If the rage power&#146;s effects depend on the skald&#146;s ability modif ier (such as lesser spirit totemAPG), affected allies use the skald&#146;s ability modif ier instead of their own for the purposes of this effect.</p>
					<p>If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptiveAPG, which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power&#146;s prerequisite.

					<p>If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage).</p>
					<p>If the skald has rage powers from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during an inspired rage. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>While the twisted power of the demon-worshiping Bekyar&#146;s skalds is great, it comes at a terrible price.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skalds are poets, historians, and keepers of lore who use their gifts for oration and song to inspire allies into a frenzied rage. They balance a violent spirit with the veneer of civilization, recording events such as heroic battles and the deeds of great leaders, enhancing these stories in the retelling to earn bloodier victories in combat. A skald&#146;s poetry is nuanced and often has multiple overlapping meanings, and he applies similar talents to emulate magic from other spellcasters.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A skald inspires his allies, and often presses forward to fight enemies in melee. Outside of combat, he&#146;s useful as a healer and scholar, less versatile but more durable than a bard.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Barbarian and bard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Skald's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (oratory, percussion, sing, string, wind) (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p>A Bekyar demon dancer gains Perform (dance) as a class skill.</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
			<p><b>Bardic Knowledge (Ex): </b>A skald adds 1/2 his class level (minimum 1) on all Knowledge skill checks, and may make all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Skalds learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;11: Skald Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Raging Song (Su): </b>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
			<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
			<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>
			<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally&#146;s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald&#146;s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song&#146;s effects last for that ally&#146;s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p>
			<p><i>Inspired Rage (Su): </i>At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but also take a &#150;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of inspired rage, allies other than the skald cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonuses on Will saves increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn&#146;t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian&#146;s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p>
			<p>If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian&#146;s rage, bloodrager&#146;s bloodrage, or skald&#146;s inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
			<p><i>Dirge of Doom (Su): </i>At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become shaken. This only affects enemies that are within 30 feet and able to hear the skald&#146;s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance. This cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the targets are already shaken from another effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect, and relies on audible components.</p>
			<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>
			<p><b>Scribe Scroll: </b>At 1st level, a skald gains Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Versatile Performance (Ex): </b>A Bekyar demon dancer can choose Perform (dance) for the versatile performance class feature. Its associated skills are Acrobatics and Fly. This ability alters versatile performance.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, a skald can choose one type of Perform skill associated with the skald class. He can use his bonus in that skill in place of his bonus in the associated skills listed below. When substituting in this way, the skald uses his total Perform skill bonus, including class skill bonus, in place of the associated skill&#146;s bonus, whether or not he has ranks in that skill or if it is a class skill. At 7th level, and every 5 levels thereafter, the bard can select an additional type of Perform to substitute.</p>
			<p>The types of Perform and their associated skills are: Oratory (Diplomacy, Sense Motive), Percussion (Handle Animal, Intimidate), Sing (Bluff, Sense Motive), String (Bluff, Diplomacy), and Wind (Diplomacy, Handle Animal).</p>
			<p><b>Well-Versed (Ex): </b>A Bekyar demon dancer can choose Perform (dance) for the versatile performance class feature. Its associated skills are Acrobatics and Fly. This ability alters versatile performance.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, the skald becomes resistant to sonic effects. The skald gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made against bardic performance, as well as all sonic or language-dependent effects.</p>
			<p><b>Fiendish Maw (Su): </b>At 3rd level, whenever a Bekyar demon dancer inspires rage, all who accept his rage gain a bite attack dealing 1d6 points of damage (for Medium allies; 1d4 points of damage if Small). This damage increases to 1d8 (1d6 if Small) at 7th level, to 2d6 (1d8 if Small) at 12th level, and to 3d6 (2d6 if Small) at 17th level. These increases effectively treat the affected creatures as though their sizes had increased by one size category, and so don&#146;t stack with any similar damage increases (such as the increase from the strong jawAPG spell) other than those due to an actual increase in size. If used as part of a full attack action, the bite attack is made at the creature&#146;s full base attack bonus &#150; 5. This ability replaces the rage power gained at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a skald gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if he is immobilized. A skald with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
			<p>If a skald already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Spell Kenning (Su): </b>At 5th level, a skald is learned in the magic of other spellcasters, and can use his own magic to duplicate those classes&#146; spells. Once per day, a skald can cast any spell on the bard, cleric, or sorcerer/wizard spell list as if it were one of his skald spells known, expending a skald spell slot of the same spell level to cast the desired spell. Casting a spell with spell kenning always has a minimum casting time of 1 full round, regardless of the casting time of the spell.</p>
			<p>At 11th level, a skald can use this ability twice per day. At 17th level, he can use this ability three times per day.</p>
			<p><b>Abyssal Wrath (Su): </b>At 6th level, the Bekyar demon dancer gains the fiend totemAPG rage power, even if he doesn&#146;t qualify for it. At 9th level, he gains the greater fiend totemAPG rage power, ignoring the prerequisites. This ability alters the rage powers gained at 6th and 9th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Demonic Conquest (Su): </b>At 7th level, the Bekyar demon dancer&#146;s dances warp the minds of those who accept them even further. Whenever anyone affected by his inspired rage makes an attack against a creature, the urge to dominate this foe rises within the affected ally. The ally can attempt to resist this urge with a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the skald&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier). If she fails the save or chooses not to attempt one, the Strength and Constitution bonuses of the demon dancer&#146;s inspire rage increase by 2, and she must continue to attack the same target each round. Once the target is defeated, she must burn or cut the symbol of a demon the Bekyar demon dancer worships into the target&#146;s flesh, which is a full-round action. The need to conquer and brand foes ends after this action or after the demon dancer stops performing, whichever comes first.</p>
			<p><b>Lore Master (Ex): </b>At 7th level, the skald becomes a master of many different types of lore, and can choose to take 10 on any Knowledge skill check that he has ranks in. Once per day, the skald can take 20 on any Knowledge skill check as a standard action, instead of spending the normal time taking 20 requires. He can use this ability to take 20 on a Knowledge skill check twice per day at 13th level and three times per day 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level and higher, a skald can no longer be flanked. This defense denies enemies the ability to sneak attack the skald by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more levels in a class that grants sneak attack than the target has skald levels.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a skald gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the skald takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 14th and 19th levels, this damage reduction increases by 1. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0. Additionally, the skald grants this DR to all allies affected by his inspired rage.</p>
			<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex): </b>At 12th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32&#150;34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack). Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.</p>
			<p>When starting an inspired rage, the skald chooses which rage powers (if any) to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of these rage powers, using the skald&#146;s level as their effective barbarian level. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers that require a minimum barbarian level. If the rage power&#146;s effects depend on the skald&#146;s ability modif ier (such as lesser spirit totemAPG), affected allies use the skald&#146;s ability modif ier instead of their own for the purposes of this effect.</p>
			<p>If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptiveAPG, which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power&#146;s prerequisite. He may add multiple rage powers to an inspired rage at the same time using this ability (such as granting superstition and disruptive simultaneously).</p>
			<p>If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage).</p>
			<p>If the skald has rage powers from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during an inspired rage. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times.</p>
			<p>If the skald has the ability to rage from another source, he can use his skald rage powers during that rage as well.</p>
			<p><b>Master Skald (Su): </b>At 20th level, a skald&#146;s inspired rage no longer gives allies a penalty to AC, nor limits what skills or abilities they can use. Allies with rage class abilities may use features dependent on those abilities without restriction, such as a barbarian&#146;s rage powers and a bloodrager&#146;s blood casting and bloodline abilities. Finally, when making a full attack, affected allies may make an additional attack each round (as if using a haste effect).</p>

Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>

				<name type="string">Raging Song</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
					<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
					<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>

					<p><i>Inspired Rage (Su): </i>At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but also take a &#150;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of inspired rage, allies other than the skald cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonuses on Will saves increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn&#146;t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian&#146;s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p>
					<p>If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian&#146;s rage, bloodrager&#146;s bloodrage, or skald&#146;s inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Questing (Su): </i>At 10th level, the battle scion can spend 4 rounds of raging song to draw upon a target&#146;s honor, ambition, and sense of self in order to bind the target to an agreed-upon task, often a noble quest. This works like geas/quest, except it applies only if the target is truly willing (not magically compelled or tricked), and the target automatically understands the full terms of the agreement before deciding whether he is willing.</p>
					<p>The battle scion can offer a reward for the completion of the noble quest, but if she does so and fails to live up to her agreement, she becomes an ex-battle scion and loses all benefits gained from the archetype (she does not gain the abilities they replaced, either). At 14th level, she can offer the same quest to up to one willing creature per skald level. If she does so, the effect ends for all creatures as soon as anyone completes the quest, though only the creature who completes it earns any offered reward.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32&#150;34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).</p>
					<p>Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.</p>
					<p>When starting an inspired rage, the skald chooses which rage powers (if any) to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of these rage powers, using the skald&#146;s level as their effective barbarian level. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers that require a minimum barbarian level. If the rage power&#146;s effects depend on the skald&#146;s ability modif ier (such as lesser spirit totemAPG), affected allies use the skald&#146;s ability modif ier instead of their own for the purposes of this effect.</p>
					<p>If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptiveAPG, which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power&#146;s prerequisite. He may add multiple rage powers to an inspired rage at the same time using this ability (such as granting superstition and disruptive simultaneously).</p>
					<p>If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage).</p>
					<p>If the skald has rage powers from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during an inspired rage. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times.</p>
					<p>If the skald has the ability to rage from another source, he can use his skald rage powers during that rage as well.</p>

If the battle scion gains multiple feats from battle prowess, allies can use these feats to meet the prerequisites for other feats while they&#146;re affected by battle prowess (for example, a battle scion with Power Attack and Cleave from battle prowess could grant both, allowing allies with a +1 base attack bonus and a Strength score of 13 to gain both, since they can use Power Attack to qualify for Cleave).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The battle scion possesses a unique mixture of courtly grace alongside martial and magical prowess. She is a warrior-poet, as skilled with her words as she is with blades. Battle scions sometimes rule as queens over courts of brave knights who scour the world championing bold quests.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skalds are poets, historians, and keepers of lore who use their gifts for oration and song to inspire allies into a frenzied rage. They balance a violent spirit with the veneer of civilization, recording events such as heroic battles and the deeds of great leaders, enhancing these stories in the retelling to earn bloodier victories in combat. A skald&#146;s poetry is nuanced and often has multiple overlapping meanings, and he applies similar talents to emulate magic from other spellcasters.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A skald inspires his allies, and often presses forward to fight enemies in melee. Outside of combat, he&#146;s useful as a healer and scholar, less versatile but more durable than a bard.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Barbarian and bard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Skald's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (oratory, percussion, sing, string, wind) (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A skald is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and even using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
			<p><b>Bardic Knowledge (Ex): </b>A skald adds 1/2 his class level (minimum 1) on all Knowledge skill checks, and may make all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Skalds learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;11: Skald Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Courtly Presence (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a battle scion&#146;s bearing radiates command and presence, allowing her to tower over her opponents in social situations. The battle scion adds 1/2 her character level to Intimidate checks, and she starts any verbal duel with an extra edge that she can use for the presence tactic so long as she is not at a significant or extreme disadvantage in the duel. However, her bardic knowledge ability applies to only Knowledge (geography), Knowledge (history), Knowledge (local), and Knowledge (nobility).</p>
			<p>This ability alters bardic knowledge.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Battle Prowess (Ex): </b>Whenever a battle scion would gain a rage power from the skald&#146;s rage power ability (at 3rd level and every 3 skald levels thereafter), she can instead choose to gain a combat feat or teamwork feat for which she meets the prerequisites. Like rage powers she selects in this way, the battle scion can grant this feat to allies under the effect of inspired rage, as long as those allies also meet the prerequisites, but she must expend 2 rounds of raging song for each round in which she grants a combat feat or teamwork feat. If the battle scion gains multiple feats from battle prowess, allies can use these feats to meet the prerequisites for other feats while they&#146;re affected by battle prowess (for example, a battle scion with Power Attack and Cleave from battle prowess could grant both, allowing allies with a +1 base attack bonus and a Strength score of 13 to gain both, since they can use Power Attack to qualify for Cleave).</p>
			<p>This alters the rage power ability.</p>
			<p><b>Raging Song (Su): </b>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
			<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
			<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>
			<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally&#146;s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald&#146;s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song&#146;s effects last for that ally&#146;s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p>
			<p><i>Inspired Rage (Su): </i>At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but also take a &#150;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of inspired rage, allies other than the skald cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonuses on Will saves increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn&#146;t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian&#146;s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p>
			<p>If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian&#146;s rage, bloodrager&#146;s bloodrage, or skald&#146;s inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Questing (Su): </i>At 10th level, the battle scion can spend 4 rounds of raging song to draw upon a target&#146;s honor, ambition, and sense of self in order to bind the target to an agreed-upon task, often a noble quest. This works like geas/quest, except it applies only if the target is truly willing (not magically compelled or tricked), and the target automatically understands the full terms of the agreement before deciding whether he is willing.</p>
			<p>The battle scion can offer a reward for the completion of the noble quest, but if she does so and fails to live up to her agreement, she becomes an ex-battle scion and loses all benefits gained from the archetype (she does not gain the abilities they replaced, either). At 14th level, she can offer the same quest to up to one willing creature per skald level. If she does so, the effect ends for all creatures as soon as anyone completes the quest, though only the creature who completes it earns any offered reward.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces dirge of doom and song of the fallen.</p>
			<p><b>Scribe Scroll: </b>At 1st level, a skald gains Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Versatile Performance (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a skald can choose one type of Perform skill associated with the skald class. He can use his bonus in that skill in place of his bonus in the associated skills listed below. When substituting in this way, the skald uses his total Perform skill bonus, including class skill bonus, in place of the associated skill&#146;s bonus, whether or not he has ranks in that skill or if it is a class skill. At 7th level, and every 5 levels thereafter, the bard can select an additional type of Perform to substitute.</p>
			<p>The types of Perform and their associated skills are: Oratory (Diplomacy, Sense Motive), Percussion (Handle Animal, Intimidate), Sing (Bluff, Sense Motive), String (Bluff, Diplomacy), and Wind (Diplomacy, Handle Animal).</p>
			<p><b>Well-Versed (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, the skald becomes resistant to sonic effects. The skald gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made against bardic performance, as well as all sonic or language-dependent effects.</p>
			<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex): </b>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32&#150;34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.</p>
			<p>When starting an inspired rage, the skald chooses which rage powers (if any) to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of these rage powers, using the skald&#146;s level as their effective barbarian level. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers that require a minimum barbarian level. If the rage power&#146;s effects depend on the skald&#146;s ability modif ier (such as lesser spirit totemAPG), affected allies use the skald&#146;s ability modif ier instead of their own for the purposes of this effect.</p>
			<p>If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptiveAPG, which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power&#146;s prerequisite. He may add multiple rage powers to an inspired rage at the same time using this ability (such as granting superstition and disruptive simultaneously).</p>
			<p>If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage).</p>
			<p>If the skald has rage powers from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during an inspired rage. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times.</p>
			<p>If the skald has the ability to rage from another source, he can use his skald rage powers during that rage as well.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a skald gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if he is immobilized. A skald with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
			<p>If a skald already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Spell Kenning (Su): </b>At 5th level, a skald is learned in the magic of other spellcasters, and can use his own magic to duplicate those classes&#146; spells. Once per day, a skald can cast any spell on the bard, cleric, or sorcerer/wizard spell list as if it were one of his skald spells known, expending a skald spell slot of the same spell level to cast the desired spell. Casting a spell with spell kenning always has a minimum casting time of 1 full round, regardless of the casting time of the spell.</p>
			<p>At 11th level, a skald can use this ability twice per day. At 17th level, he can use this ability three times per day.</p>
			<p><b>Lore Master (Ex): </b>At 7th level, the skald becomes a master of many different types of lore, and can choose to take 10 on any Knowledge skill check that he has ranks in. Once per day, the skald can take 20 on any Knowledge skill check as a standard action, instead of spending the normal time taking 20 requires. He can use this ability to take 20 on a Knowledge skill check twice per day at 13th level and three times per day 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level and higher, a skald can no longer be flanked. This defense denies enemies the ability to sneak attack the skald by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more levels in a class that grants sneak attack than the target has skald levels.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a skald gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the skald takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 14th and 19th levels, this damage reduction increases by 1. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0. Additionally, the skald grants this DR to all allies affected by his inspired rage.</p>
			<p><b>Once and Future Scion (Su): </b>At 20th level, a battle scion becomes extremely difficult to kill. Whenever she is slain, as long as her body isn&#146;t destroyed, she enters a deathlike sleep for 3 days, after which she returns to life as per raise dead, except that it can restore her even if she was slain by a death effect. Spells that would restore her to life function as if she were dead during this time, allowing her to recover sooner.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces master skald.</p>

					<p>Song of Urging (Su) <i>At 3rd level, the bacchanal&#146;s raging </i>song can wordlessly influence creatures of the wild. This raging song functions just like a Diplomacy check to make a simple request or an Intimidate check but can influence only animals. The bacchanal rolls 1d20 and adds his skald level and his Charisma modifier to determine the urging check&#146;s result. Bonuses and penalties that apply to wild empathy checks apply to these urging checks. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. The song can influence plants or magical beasts with Intelligence scores of 1 or 2 as well as drunken creatures of any Intelligence (even without sharing a language), but against these nonanimals, the bacchanal takes a &#150;4 penalty on this check. The bacchanal must continue to perform the song for the entire time required for the check; otherwise, its effect is wasted, but only 1 round of raging song is expended regardless of how long the check takes.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
					<p><i>Maddening Dance (Su): </i>At 10th level, the bacchanal&#146;s raging song can compel a creature within 30 feet to perform an ecstatic dance. Unless it succeeds at its Will save, the victim becomes confused, takes a &#150;2 penalty to its AC and on Reflex saving throws, and loses the benefit of any shield it holds. The effect ends when the target can no longer hear the bacchanal from within 30 feet. As an immediate action, an ally of the bacchanal within 30 feet can dance along as a full-round action (taking all penalties except the confused condition for that round) to allow the bacchanal to target an additional creature. A creature that succeeds at the Will saving throw against this raging song is immune to this effect for 24 hours. This is a compulsion, emotion, enchantment, and mind-affecting effect.</p>
					<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>

					<p>A bacchanal adds goodberry to his list of 1st-level skald spells known. In addition, he can cast it as a spell-like ability once per day. When he casts goodberry as a spell or spell-like ability, the targeted berries ferment; this causes each berry to act as a serving of an alcoholic beverage. A creature that eats a fermented berry does not gain a meal&#146;s nourishment, but it is cured of 1 point of damage and becomes slightly foolhardy as if tipsy, gaining a +1 bonus on saves against fear effects for 1 minute after eating the berry.</p>

					<p>At 2nd level, while maintaining a raging song, a bacchanal can consume a berry affected by goodberry, a potion, or a serving of alcohol as a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A berry affected by goodberry or a potion has its normal effect, while an alcoholic drink or a berry affected by goodberry via fermented fruit (see above) allows the skald to maintain his raging song that round without expending a round of raging song for the day (instead of the normal effects of the alcohol or fermented berry). For each alcoholic drink or fermented berry consumed while raging, the skald is nauseated for 1 round after his raging song ends. The internal fortitude rage power prevents this nauseated condition from occurring.</p>
					<p>At 7th level, when the bacchanal consumes an alcoholic drink or fermented berry while maintaining his rage song, he can gain the benefits of cure light wounds or remove fear (for the duration of the raging song) at his caster level by spending 2 rounds of raging song. At 12th level, the bacchanal can gain the benefits of heroism (for the duration of the raging song) in this manner. At 17th level, he can gain the benefits of persistent vigor (for the duration of the raging song) in this manner.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32&#150;34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).</p>

If the rage power&#146;s effects depend on the skald&#146;s ability modif ier (such as lesser spirit totemAPG), affected allies use the skald&#146;s ability modif ier instead of their own for the purposes of this effect.</p>
					<p>If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptiveAPG, which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power&#146;s prerequisite.

					<p>If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Bacchanals are skalds who use ecstatic dancing and ribald songs to influence the primal instincts of listeners. To these skalds, the passionate frenzy of a celebration or feast shares many features with the violence of combat, and several of their talents blur the line between festival and battle in dramatic ways.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skalds are poets, historians, and keepers of lore who use their gifts for oration and song to inspire allies into a frenzied rage. They balance a violent spirit with the veneer of civilization, recording events such as heroic battles and the deeds of great leaders, enhancing these stories in the retelling to earn bloodier victories in combat. A skald&#146;s poetry is nuanced and often has multiple overlapping meanings, and he applies similar talents to emulate magic from other spellcasters.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A skald inspires his allies, and often presses forward to fight enemies in melee. Outside of combat, he&#146;s useful as a healer and scholar, less versatile but more durable than a bard.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Barbarian and bard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Skald's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (oratory, percussion, sing, string, wind) (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A skald is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and even using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
			<p><b>Bardic Knowledge (Ex): </b>A skald adds 1/2 his class level (minimum 1) on all Knowledge skill checks, and may make all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Skalds learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;11: Skald Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Fermented Fruit (Sp): </b>A bacchanal adds goodberry to his list of 1st-level skald spells known. In addition, he can cast it as a spell-like ability once per day. When he casts goodberry as a spell or spell-like ability, the targeted berries ferment; this causes each berry to act as a serving of an alcoholic beverage. A creature that eats a fermented berry does not gain a meal&#146;s nourishment, but it is cured of 1 point of damage and becomes slightly foolhardy as if tipsy, gaining a +1 bonus on saves against fear effects for 1 minute after eating the berry.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Raging Song (Su): </b>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
			<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
			<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>
			<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally&#146;s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald&#146;s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song&#146;s effects last for that ally&#146;s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p>
			<p><i>Inspired Rage (Su): </i>At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but also take a &#150;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of inspired rage, allies other than the skald cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonuses on Will saves increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn&#146;t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian&#146;s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p>
			<p>If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian&#146;s rage, bloodrager&#146;s bloodrage, or skald&#146;s inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Urging (Su) </i>At 3rd level, the bacchanal&#146;s raging song can wordlessly influence creatures of the wild. This raging song functions just like a Diplomacy check to make a simple request or an Intimidate check but can influence only animals. The bacchanal rolls 1d20 and adds his skald level and his Charisma modifier to determine the urging check&#146;s result. Bonuses and penalties that apply to wild empathy checks apply to these urging checks. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. The song can influence plants or magical beasts with Intelligence scores of 1 or 2 as well as drunken creatures of any Intelligence (even without sharing a language), but against these nonanimals, the bacchanal takes a &#150;4 penalty on this check. The bacchanal must continue to perform the song for the entire time required for the check; otherwise, its effect is wasted, but only 1 round of raging song is expended regardless of how long the check takes.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
			<p><i>Maddening Dance (Su): </i>At 10th level, the bacchanal&#146;s raging song can compel a creature within 30 feet to perform an ecstatic dance. Unless it succeeds at its Will save, the victim becomes confused, takes a &#150;2 penalty to its AC and on Reflex saving throws, and loses the benefit of any shield it holds. The effect ends when the target can no longer hear the bacchanal from within 30 feet. As an immediate action, an ally of the bacchanal within 30 feet can dance along as a full-round action (taking all penalties except the confused condition for that round) to allow the bacchanal to target an additional creature. A creature that succeeds at the Will saving throw against this raging song is immune to this effect for 24 hours. This is a compulsion, emotion, enchantment, and mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>
			<p><b>Drunken Dancer (Su): </b>At 2nd level, while maintaining a raging song, a bacchanal can consume a berry affected by goodberry, a potion, or a serving of alcohol as a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A berry affected by goodberry or a potion has its normal effect, while an alcoholic drink or a berry affected by goodberry via fermented fruit (see above) allows the skald to maintain his raging song that round without expending a round of raging song for the day (instead of the normal effects of the alcohol or fermented berry). For each alcoholic drink or fermented berry consumed while raging, the skald is nauseated for 1 round after his raging song ends. The internal fortitude rage power prevents this nauseated condition from occurring.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, when the bacchanal consumes an alcoholic drink or fermented berry while maintaining his rage song, he can gain the benefits of cure light wounds or remove fear (for the duration of the raging song) at his caster level by spending 2 rounds of raging song. At 12th level, the bacchanal can gain the benefits of heroism (for the duration of the raging song) in this manner. At 17th level, he can gain the benefits of persistent vigor (for the duration of the raging song) in this manner.</p>
			<p>This replaces versatile performance.</p>
			<p><b>Well-Versed (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, the skald becomes resistant to sonic effects. The skald gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made against bardic performance, as well as all sonic or language-dependent effects.</p>
			<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex): </b>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32&#150;34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.</p>
			<p>When starting an inspired rage, the skald chooses which rage powers (if any) to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of these rage powers, using the skald&#146;s level as their effective barbarian level. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers that require a minimum barbarian level. If the rage power&#146;s effects depend on the skald&#146;s ability modif ier (such as lesser spirit totemAPG), affected allies use the skald&#146;s ability modif ier instead of their own for the purposes of this effect.</p>
			<p>If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptiveAPG, which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power&#146;s prerequisite. He may add multiple rage powers to an inspired rage at the same time using this ability (such as granting superstition and disruptive simultaneously).</p>
			<p>If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage).</p>
			<p>If the skald has rage powers from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during an inspired rage. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times.</p>
			<p>If the skald has the ability to rage from another source, he can use his skald rage powers during that rage as well.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a skald gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if he is immobilized. A skald with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
			<p>If a skald already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Spell Kenning (Su): </b>At 5th level, a skald is learned in the magic of other spellcasters, and can use his own magic to duplicate those classes&#146; spells. Once per day, a skald can cast any spell on the bard, cleric, or sorcerer/wizard spell list as if it were one of his skald spells known, expending a skald spell slot of the same spell level to cast the desired spell. Casting a spell with spell kenning always has a minimum casting time of 1 full round, regardless of the casting time of the spell.</p>
			<p>At 11th level, a skald can use this ability twice per day. At 17th level, he can use this ability three times per day.</p>
			<p><b>Lore Master (Ex): </b>At 7th level, the skald becomes a master of many different types of lore, and can choose to take 10 on any Knowledge skill check that he has ranks in. Once per day, the skald can take 20 on any Knowledge skill check as a standard action, instead of spending the normal time taking 20 requires. He can use this ability to take 20 on a Knowledge skill check twice per day at 13th level and three times per day 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level and higher, a skald can no longer be flanked. This defense denies enemies the ability to sneak attack the skald by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more levels in a class that grants sneak attack than the target has skald levels.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a skald gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the skald takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 14th and 19th levels, this damage reduction increases by 1. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0. Additionally, the skald grants this DR to all allies affected by his inspired rage.</p>
			<p><b>Master Skald (Su): </b>At 20th level, a skald&#146;s inspired rage no longer gives allies a penalty to AC, nor limits what skills or abilities they can use. Allies with rage class abilities may use features dependent on those abilities without restriction, such as a barbarian&#146;s rage powers and a bloodrager&#146;s blood casting and bloodline abilities. Finally, when making a full attack, affected allies may make an additional attack each round (as if using a haste effect).</p>

					<p>If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian&#146;s rage, bloodrager&#146;s bloodrage, or skald&#146;s inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
					<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
					<p><i>Dirge of Doom (Su): </i>At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become shaken. This only affects enemies that are within 30 feet and able to hear the skald&#146;s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance. This cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the targets are already shaken from another effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect, and relies on audible components.</p>
					<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Tales of Merivesta Olinchi are surprisingly common among the Bekyar of the Mwangi Expanse, who claim she spent some time studying their traditions and history. Most historians find it more likely that a Bekyar skald spent time in Nex, was exposed to the idea of divination as a tool of war from a copy of Cold Irony, and fabricated tales of how that knowledge came to be in his hands.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skalds are poets, historians, and keepers of lore who use their gifts for oration and song to inspire allies into a frenzied rage. They balance a violent spirit with the veneer of civilization, recording events such as heroic battles and the deeds of great leaders, enhancing these stories in the retelling to earn bloodier victories in combat. A skald&#146;s poetry is nuanced and often has multiple overlapping meanings, and he applies similar talents to emulate magic from other spellcasters.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>A skald inspires his allies, and often presses forward to fight enemies in melee. Outside of combat, he&#146;s useful as a healer and scholar, less versatile but more durable than a bard.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Barbarian and bard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Skald's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (oratory, percussion, sing, string, wind) (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A skald is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and even using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
			<p><b>Bardic Knowledge (Ex): </b>A skald adds 1/2 his class level (minimum 1) on all Knowledge skill checks, and may make all Knowledge skill checks untrained.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Skalds learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;11: Skald Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component&#151;these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even non-verbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a skald&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the skald&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The skald&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald&#146;s choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;11 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Raging Song (Su): </b>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p>
			<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard&#146;s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21).</p>
			<p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.</p>
			<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally&#146;s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald&#146;s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song&#146;s effects last for that ally&#146;s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p>
			<p><i>Inspired Rage (Su): </i>At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but also take a &#150;1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of inspired rage, allies other than the skald cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the song&#146;s bonuses on Will saves increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn&#146;t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song&#146;s bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian&#146;s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p>
			<p>If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian&#146;s rage, bloodrager&#146;s bloodrage, or skald&#146;s inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). However, inspired rage does not allow the ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Marching (Su): </i>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>
			<p><i>Song of Strength (Su): </i>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald&#146;s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
			<p><i>Dirge of Doom (Su): </i>At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become shaken. This only affects enemies that are within 30 feet and able to hear the skald&#146;s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance. This cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the targets are already shaken from another effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect, and relies on audible components.</p>
			<p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su): </i>At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies to continue fighting, with the same limitations as raise dead. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald may expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald may revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p>
			<p><b>Scribe Scroll: </b>At 1st level, a skald gains Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Monster Insight (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, the augur applies his Charisma modifier in addition to his Intelligence modifier when attempting Knowledge checks to identify the abilities and weaknesses of creatures. Monster insight counts as the monster lore class feature for prerequisites. This ability replaces well-versed.</p>
			<p><b>Signs and Portents (Su): </b>At 2nd level, an augur can read signs and portents to attempt to ascertain how events in the near future will play out. This allows the augur to cast augury as a spell-like ability. At 7th level, he can instead use signs and portents to cast divination as a spell-like ability, and at 12th level, he can instead cast commune as a spell-like ability. At 17th level, he can use signs and portents twice per day. This ability replaces all types of versatile performance.</p>
			<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex): </b>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32&#150;34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).</p>
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.</p>
			<p>When starting an inspired rage, the skald chooses which rage powers (if any) to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of these rage powers, using the skald&#146;s level as their effective barbarian level. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers that require a minimum barbarian level. If the rage power&#146;s effects depend on the skald&#146;s ability modif ier (such as lesser spirit totemAPG), affected allies use the skald&#146;s ability modif ier instead of their own for the purposes of this effect.</p>
			<p>If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptiveAPG, which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power&#146;s prerequisite. He may add multiple rage powers to an inspired rage at the same time using this ability (such as granting superstition and disruptive simultaneously).</p>
			<p>If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage).</p>
			<p>If the skald has rage powers from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during an inspired rage. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times.</p>
			<p>If the skald has the ability to rage from another source, he can use his skald rage powers during that rage as well.</p>
			<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a skald gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if he is immobilized. A skald with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
			<p>If a skald already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
			<p><b>Predictive Strike (Su): </b>At 5th level, the augur accurately divines the possible movements of his enemies in combat. Once per day as a free action, he can declare one of his melee attacks to be a predictive strike. Against the augur&#146;s attack, the target is flat-footed and gains no benefits from concealment or cover. Attacks from other creatures are treated normally. The target still benefits from total concealment and total cover normally. At 11th level, the augur can use this ability a total of two attacks per day, and at 17th, three attacks per day. This replaces spell kenning.</p>
			<p><b>Lore Master (Ex): </b>At 7th level, the skald becomes a master of many different types of lore, and can choose to take 10 on any Knowledge skill check that he has ranks in. Once per day, the skald can take 20 on any Knowledge skill check as a standard action, instead of spending the normal time taking 20 requires. He can use this ability to take 20 on a Knowledge skill check twice per day at 13th level and three times per day 19th level.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 8th level and higher, a skald can no longer be flanked. This defense denies enemies the ability to sneak attack the skald by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more levels in a class that grants sneak attack than the target has skald levels.</p>
			<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level required to flank the character.</p>
			<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a skald gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the skald takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 14th and 19th levels, this damage reduction increases by 1. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0. Additionally, the skald grants this DR to all allies affected by his inspired rage.</p>
			<p><b>Master Skald (Su): </b>At 20th level, a skald&#146;s inspired rage no longer gives allies a penalty to AC, nor limits what skills or abilities they can use. Allies with rage class abilities may use features dependent on those abilities without restriction, such as a barbarian&#146;s rage powers and a bloodrager&#146;s blood casting and bloodline abilities. Finally, when making a full attack, affected allies may make an additional attack each round (as if using a haste effect).</p>
