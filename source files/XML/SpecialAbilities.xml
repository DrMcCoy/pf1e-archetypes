				<p>The arcanist can unleash a jet of acid by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir and making a ranged touch attack against any one target within 30 feet. If the attack hits, it deals 1d6 points of acid damage + the arcanist&#146;s Charisma modifier, plus an additional 1d6 points of acid damage for every 2 levels beyond 1st (to a maximum of 10d6 at 19th level). The target is also sickened for 1d4 rounds. It can attempt a Fortitude saving throw to negate the sickened condition.</p>

				<p>When the arcanist is under the effect of a spell of the polymorph subschool that she cast, she can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to change to another valid form allowed by the spell. This reduces the spell&#146;s caster level by 1, which can take the spell&#146;s caster level below the minimum caster level necessary to cast the spell, and reduces the spell&#146;s duration if applicable. The arcanist must have the Shift Caster exploit to select this exploit.</p>

			<text type="formattedtext">
				<p>As a swift action, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to create a barrier of magic that protects her from harm. This barrier grants the arcanist a number of temporary hit points equal to her arcanist level + her Charisma modif ier, and lasts for 1 minute per arcanist level or until all the temporary hit points have been lost. Each additional time per day the arcanist uses this ability, the number of arcane reservoir points she must spend to activate it increases by 1 (so the second time it is used, the arcanist must expend 2 points from her arcane reservoir, 3 points for the third time, and so on). The temporary hit points from this ability do not stack with themselves, but additional uses do cause the total number of temporary hit points and the duration to reset.</p>

The effects of any arcane discovery that she selects with this exploit apply only to arcanist spells that she casts, not to wizard spells, and she cannot select an arcane discovery in place of a feat (unless she also has wizard levels, in which case the discovery applies only to her wizard spells).</p>

			<name type="string">Arcane Weapon (Su)</name>
			<text type="formattedtext">
				<p>As a standard action, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to enhance her weapon. The weapon is treated as magic for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. At 5th level, the weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus, which increases by 1 for every 4 levels beyond 5th (to a maximum of +4 at 17th level). These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5. An arcanist can also use this exploit to add one of the following weapon special abilities: dancing, defending, distance, flaming, flaming burst, frost, icy burst, keen, shock, shocking burst, speed, spell storing, and throwing. Adding these special abilities replaces an amount of enhancement bonus equal to the ability&#146;s cost. Duplicate special abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added to it before any other weapon special abilities can be added. The benefits are decided upon when the exploit is used, and they cannot be changed unless the exploit is used again. These benefits only apply to weapons wielded by the arcanist; if another creature attempts to wield the weapon, it loses these benefits, though they resume if the arcanist regains possession of the weapon. The arcanist cannot have more than one use of this ability active at a time. This effect lasts for a number of minutes equal to the arcanist&#146;s Charisma modifier (minimum 1).</p>

The arcanist must select an ordinary bloodline with this ability, not one altered by an archetype. As a swift action, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to bolster her latent nature, allowing her to treat her arcanist level as her sorcerer level for the purpose of using this ability, which lasts for a number of rounds equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1).</p>
				<p>She does not gain any other abilities when using this exploit in this way, such as bloodline arcana or those bloodline powers gained at 3rd level or higher. If this ability is used to gain an arcane bond and a bonded item is selected, the arcanist can only use that item to cast spells of a level equal to the level of spell that could be cast by her equivalent sorcerer level (limiting her to 1st level spells unless she spends a point from her arcane reservoir).</p>
				<p>If the arcanist already has a bloodline (or gains one later), taking this exploit instead allows her arcanist levels to stack with the levels of the class that granted her access to the bloodline when determining the powers and abilities of her bloodline.</p>

				<p>The arcanist can consume the power of potions, scrolls, staves, and wands, using them to fill her arcane reservoir. Using this ability is a move action that provokes an attack of opportunity. When using this exploit, the arcanist adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to 1/2 the level of the spell contained in the item (o-level and 1st-level spells do not recharge the arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir). If used on a potion or scroll, the item is destroyed. If used on a wand, the wand loses 5 charges; if it has fewer than 5 charges, the wand is destroyed and the arcanist gains no benefit. If used on a staff, it loses 1 charge and the arcanist gains a number of points to his arcane reservoir equal to the level of the highest-level spell the staff can cast using only 1 charge; if the staff has no spells that require only 1 charge, the arcanist cannot consume that staff&#146;s magic. No more than 1 charge can be drawn from a staff each day in this way. Points gained in excess of the arcanist&#146;s reservoir&#146;s maximum are lost. This exploit has no effect on magic armor, weapons, rings, rods, wondrous items, or other magic items besides those noted above.</p>

Counterspelling in this way does not trigger any feats or other abilities that normally occur when a spellcaster successfully counters a spell.</p>

				<p>In seeking to restore formal training in magic to the world, Old-Mage Jatembe also discovered a few methods of creating magic effects that did not follow consistent or logical rules. While his only known remaining notes on these more chaotic forms of magic are closely guarded within the Magaambya, some arcanists have either recreated his theories from vague comments on other topics or independently rediscovered the methods Jatembe first detailed. This &#147;primal magic&#148; can be accessed one of two ways.</p>
				<p>The arcanist can expend 1 or more points from her arcane reservoir to create an uncontrolled primal effect. This creates an effect from the Sample Primal Magic Events table (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Magic 13). The CR of this effect is equal to the arcanist&#146;s caster level, to a maximum caster level of 5 per point spent from her arcane reserve. In this case, the effect is treated as a spell with a spell level equal to half its CR (maximum spell level 9).</p>
				<p>Alternatively, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir and expend a spell slot of at least 3rd level to create an effect as if she has used a rod of wonder. Any spell created by the rod of wonder effect uses the arcanist&#146;s spell level, rather than the spell level set by the rod of wonder table (for example a fireball created by an 8th level arcanist rolling on the rod of wonder table would deal 8d6, rather than the listed 6d6).

As a swift action, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to bolster her understanding, allowing her to treat her arcanist level as her wizard level for the purpose of using this ability for a number of rounds equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). During this time, she also gains use of the other ability gained at 1st level for her selected school. She does not gain any other abilities when using this exploit in this way, such as those gained at 8th level.</p>
				<p>If the arcanist already has an arcane school (or gains one later), taking this exploit instead allows her arcanist levels to stack with the levels of the class that granted the arcane school when determining the powers and abilities of her arcane school.</p>

If the arcanist uses his tongue and hits a creature capable of casting spells or using spell-like abilities, he drains a portion of the target&#146;s magical ability and adds 1 point to his arcane reservoir (points gained in excess of the reservoir&#146;s maximum are lost). If the arcanist hits a creature that cannot cast spells or use spell-like abilities, the tongue instead drains a portion of the target&#146;s life force and heals the arcanist of 1d6 points of damage.

If the target resists the spell&#146;s effects with a successful save or other methods (such as via spell resistance or by being immune to that spell&#146;s effects) the soulrider automatically fails to attach to the victim. Detect magic and detect evil can uncover the presence of a soulrider. As long as the soulrider persists, the arcanist can track the targeted creature as if it were under the effect of status, and the creature takes a &#150;2 penalty to any saving throw against a mind-affecting effect created by the arcanist. While the soulrider remains bonded to the target, the arcanist can spend 1 point from his arcane reservoir to communicate with the target as per sending. Soulrider is a mind-affecting effect.</p>

				<p>As a swift action, the arcanist can spend 2 points from his arcane pool to sprout a pair of rubbery tentacles that grow from his upper chest. At the same time, his arms shrink into sickly, malformed stubs, capable of only rudimentary actions such as lifting small objects or making somatic gestures. Rings, bracers, and other items worn on the atrophied arms and hands remain in place, but magic items that require hands to activate cannot be used while the arcanist&#146;s arms are in this state. Likewise, the use of weapons or shields is impossible during this time. The arcanist has full control over his hideous tentacles and can use them to deliver touch spells, or as secondary natural weapons that deal tentacle damage as appropriate for a creature of the arcanist&#146;s size (1d4 for Medium arcanists, or 1d3 for Small ones) modified by 1/2 the arcanist&#146;s Strength score. The arcanist&#146;s reach with these tentacles is 5 feet longer than his normal reach.</p>

A delayed bomb detonates immediately if any other creature attempts to touch or move it, or if the bomb's contents are removed from the vial (such as if the vial breaks). The bomb deals damage as if it scored a direct hit to any creature in the square with the bomb when it detonates, and splash damage to all adjacent creatures as normal. An alchemist cannot have more than one delayed bomb at one time. If he creates another delayed bomb, the previous bomb becomes inert.

The bomb&#146;s effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the number of damage dice the bomb would normally deal (for instance, a 5d6 bomb lasts for 5 rounds). When the bomb hits the direct target, the bomb deals 1d6 + the alchemist&#146;s Intelligence modifier in damage, and those within the splash zone take damage equal to 1 + the alchemist&#146;s Intelligence modifier. It repeats this damage against the direct target of the bomb each round the immolation bomb lasts, dealing the damage at the start of the alchemist&#146;s turn. Splash damage is dealt again to any creature that is adjacent to the direct target when it takes damage from the immolation bomb. A creature taking damage from an immolation bomb&#146;s direct hit can attempt to extinguish the flames as a full-round action that requires a Reflex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the alchemist&#146;s level + the alchemist&#146;s Intelligent modifier).

			<text type="formattedtext">
				<p>Unlike normal bombs, jury-rigged bombs can be created from whatever materials the alchemist has on hand; this makes them particularly handy in situations where the alchemist might find himself imprisoned or stripped of his equipment. Jury-rigged bombs can be crafted and thrown as a swift action (this counts against the alchemist&#146;s daily use of bombs), and they deal only 1d4 points of damage + additional damage equal to half the alchemist&#146;s Intelligence modifier on a direct hit. This damage increases by 1d4 at 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter. Despite being useful in a pinch, jury-rigged bombs are nonetheless crudely crafted and highly unstable; if the alchemist&#146;s attack roll results in a natural 1, the bomb explodes as he is creating it, and he takes damage as if he had taken a direct hit. An alchemist must be at least 4th level before selecting this discovery.</p>

			<name type="string">Neutralizing Bomb</name>
			<text type="formattedtext">
				<p>When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to give it the potential to end certain ongoing effects instead of dealing damage. Each creature in the splash radius can attempt a new saving throw against any poison afflicting it and any ongoing conditions or ongoing acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage. (If an effect did not allow a saving throw, this bomb doesn&#146;t allow affected creatures to attempt one.) Success counts as one successful save toward ending poison and immediately ends other conditions. Exposed poison in the splash radius is also rendered harmless. A creature with poison abilities that is directly struck by the bomb finds those abilities useless for 1d4 rounds unless it succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw. This discovery doesn&#146;t stack with any other that modifies bombs.</p>

				<p>The alchemist gains the ability to travel between shadows as if by means of a dimension door spell. The limitation is that the alchemist&#146;s beginning and ending locations must be areas of dim light or darker, or within the radius of an umbral gloom that is lowering the light level. The alchemist can travel up to a total of 100 feet each day in this way. This distance must be used in 10-foot increments; for example, the alchemist can make a single jump of 100 feet or 10 jumps of 10 feet each. For every 2 levels beyond 10th, the distance the alchemist can jump each day doubles (200 feet at 12th level, 400 feet at 14th level, and so on). An alchemist must be at least 10th level before selecting this discovery.</p>

This ability works exactly like the investigator&#146;s inspiration ability, except that the alchemist gains the pool of inspiration upon drinking the inspiring cognatogen, and any unspent inspiration is lost at the end of the cognatogen&#146;s duration. If the alchemist already has access to inspiration, the inspiration added by the inspiring cognatogen is added to his inspiration pool, but each time he expends at least one use of inspiration while this ability is active, he must succeed at a DC 20 Will saving throw or become dazed for 1 round.

				<p>Once per day while under the effects of his mutagen, the alchemist can split into two identical copies of himself as an immediate action after being damaged by a piercing or slashing weapon. Each copy has an ooze-like complexion, most often manifesting as a slimy sheen to his skin. The alchemist splits his current hit points evenly between the copies. The copies use the same statistics, share the same resources, and have identical equipment (except artifacts, which only one copy has). Similarly, if one of the copies expends a charge or daily use from a magic item that a copy has, the charge or daily use is expended from both copies. If one copy drops or gives away an item, the duplicate item disappears from the other copy as well.</p>
				<p>The two copies act independently and each one has a full set of actions. At the end of the alchemist&#146;s next turn, he selects one of the copies, which loses its ooze-like complexion as it becomes the alchemist; the other copy dissolves into a fine mist and dissipates. If one of the copies is destroyed before this happens, the remaining copy immediately becomes the alchemist, and he gains 1 permanent negative level. If both copies are destroyed simultaneously (such as from a fireball), both copies collapse into formless goo; the alchemist can only be restored to life via resurrection or similarly powerful magic.

				<p>Once per day, the alchemist can brew an elixir of life. This special concoction costs 25,000 gp to create and takes 1 hour of work. An elixir of life, when administered by the alchemist who brewed it, restores life to a dead creature as per the spell true resurrection. Alternatively, the alchemist himself may drink the elixir of life, after which point he is immediately targeted with a resurrection spell the next time he is killed. Used in this manner, the effects of an elixir of life persist only for a number of days equal to the alchemist's Intelligence modifier; if he does not die before that time expires, the effects of the elixir of life end. An alchemist must be at least 16th level before selecting this discovery.</p>

When the sleeper agent is activated, treat her as if she were the target of a dominate person spell with a caster level equal to the alchemist&#146;s level at the time the sleeper agent was created. If the sleeper agent is killed or the dominate person effect&#146;s duration expires, the sleeper agent is permanently released from the alchemist&#146;s control. The alchemist can also release any sleeper agent as a free action. The alchemist can have one active sleeper agent for every 6 alchemist levels he possesses. An alchemist must be at least 12th level before selecting this discovery.</p>

The tumor can reattach itself to the alchemist as a standard action. The tumor has all the abilities of the animal it resembles (for example, a batlike tumor can fly) and familiar abilities based on the alchemist&#146;s caster level (though some familiar abilities may be useless to an alchemist). The tumor acts as the alchemist&#146;s familiar whether attached or separated (providing a skill bonus, the Alertness feat, and so on). When attached to the alchemist, the tumor has fast healing 5. An alchemist&#146;s extracts and mutagens are considered spells for the purposes of familiar abilities like share spells and deliver touch spells. If a tumor familiar is lost or dies, it can be replaced 1 week later through a specialized procedure that costs 200 gp per alchemist level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete.</p>

			<text type="formattedtext">
				<p>Once per round while raging, the barbarian can attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver in place of a melee attack. This attempt does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If successful, the target takes an amount of damage equal to the barbarian&#146;s Strength modifier and must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the barbarian&#146;s level + the barbarian&#146;s Strength modifier) or take an additional penalty from the dirty trick based on the type of dirty trick performed and the following table.</p>
				<table>

				<p>On a failed Fortitude save, the opponent takes this additional penalty on top of the dirty trick&#146;s original effect. The additional penalty lasts for 1 round (though the initial penalty lasts as long as normal), and can be removed with a move action. The initial effect cannot be removed via mundane means until the additional penalty is removed (though magical effects like remove blindness/deafness work). Removing the initial effect also removes the additional penalty. If the target is immune to the initial penalty, then it is unaffected by the additional penalty.</p>
				<p>For example, a barbarian using this rage power attempts a dirty trick combat maneuver against her opponent to blind him. She succeeds and her opponent fails his Fortitude save, so he becomes staggered as well as blinded. Regardless of whether he had succeeded at his saving throw, the opponent still takes an amount of damage from the barbarian&#146;s combat maneuver equal to the barbarian&#146;s Strength modifier (unless he has damage reduction or would otherwise be able to prevent this damage). Likewise, if her opponent were immune to blinding effects, he would not suffer from the blindness or the staggering effect, regardless of his saving throw.</p>

				<p>The barbarian can create a whirlwind with a powerful spinning move as an immediate action after she confirms a critical hit with a melee attack. The whirlwind circles the target of her melee attack, lifting it in the air slightly until the end of the barbarian&#146;s turn. The creature can attempt a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the barbarian&#146;s level + the barbarian&#146;s Constitution modifier) to negate this effect. If it fails the save, the target loses its Dexterity modifier to AC for the rest of the barbarian&#146;s turn and lands prone on the ground at the end of her turn. Raging whirlwind has no effect on flying creatures. A barbarian must be at least 12th level to choose this rage power.</p>

This attack inflicts 1d8 points of damage for a Medium mount, 2d6 for a Large mount, or 2d8 for a Huge mount, plus 1&#150;1/2 times the mount&#146;s Strength modifier. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the barbarian&#146;s level + the mount&#146;s Strength modifier) halves this damage.

A creature&#146;s Strength penalty from this ability cannot exceed the barbarian&#146;s class level. At 12th level, the barbarian can choose to create a 10-foot-radius aura of radioactivity when she begins her rage.</p>

				<p>When the barbarian rages, enemies find it difficult to escape the vortex of her fury. As a full-round action while raging, the barbarian can attempt a single combat maneuver check against each creature within 10 feet of her. If her roll equals or exceeds a creature&#146;s CMD, she moves that creature 5 feet closer to her. Once per day after attempting this maneuver, she can attack each adjacent creature as a free action as if using the Whirlwind Attack feat. If she has the Whirlwind Attack feat, she can also use it as a free action in this way one additional time per day.</p>

Each round that the barbarian rages reduces the duration of negative spells and effects inflicted upon her as if 2 rounds had passed; this has no effect on the duration of such effects against other creatures. Once per day, the barbarian can expend 5 rounds of rage to attempt a new saving throw against each nonpermanent effect currently affecting her. Each successful saving throw ends the related effect, and she can choose not to make a save against an effect.</p>

				<p>Prerequisite: Perform (oratory) 3 ranks.</p>
				<p>Cost: Feat or 1st-level spell known or higher (see text).</p>
				<p>Effect: Rather than a single work, this masterpiece is a collection of poems from Arrowsong&#146;s days living under her scholarly parents, who both desperately wanted their daughter to pursue the art of wizardry. Despite the poems&#146; wry tone and the overall distaste for book-learning they proclaim, Arrowsong&#146;s verse perfectly documents the process of memorizing arcane spells. When you gain this masterpiece, it becomes associated with your bard spells of a specific spell level. If you paid the masterpiece&#146;s cost by spending a bard spell you know, the masterpiece is associated with spells of the spent spell&#146;s level.

				<p>In order to perform this masterpiece, you must be holding a spellbook, scroll, or a similar piece of arcane writing to consult. After completing the masterpiece, choose one arcane spell from your bard spell list or from the sorcerer/wizard spell list that is written on the arcane writing that you consulted during the masterpiece. If the spell is on your bard spell list, it must be of the same level (or lower) as the spell level associated with this masterpiece. If the spell is not on your bard spell list, its level must be at least 2 spell levels lower than the spell level associated with this masterpiece. Add the chosen spell to the bard spell list and to your list of bard spells known until the next time that you rest and regain spells.</p>
				<p>If you use a spellbook with a preparation ritual to perform the masterpiece, you also gain the boon associated with that spellbook, as if you had prepared a spell from it. You can add up to one spell per spell level that you have selected with this masterpiece to your list of bard spells known each day. You can gain this masterpiece multiple times. Each time, you must apply it to a different bard spell level.</p>

				<p>Your ominous refrain warns away those who would trespass in your domain.</p>
				<p>Prerequisite: Perform (sing) or Perform (string instruments) 7 ranks.</p>
				<p>Cost: Feat or 2nd-level spell known.</p>
				<p>Effect: Your song warns of the terrible fate awaiting anyone entering your territory. All creatures within 30 feet who can hear your performance must succeed at a Will saving throw or be compelled to flee from you, as per greater command. For creatures on a ship, this effect means taking efforts to alter course and sail away. An affected creature continues its efforts for as long as the performance continues, and it reacts with violence to anyone attempting to prevent it from fleeing. Abilities that extend the duration of a bardic performance (such as Lingering Performance) affect this masterpiece.</p>

				<p>Effect: This stirring pibroch reminds dragons of a significant victory by one of the legendary heroes of their kind and fills lesser races with a feeling of frustration and rage.

				<p>Your skilled playing can conjure up supernatural servants.</p>
				<p>Prerequisite: Perform (string) 11 ranks.</p>
				<p>Cost: Feat or 4th-level bard spell known.</p>
				<p>Effect: This fast-paced tune harmonizes with the magical frequencies of another plane, allowing you to draw an extraplanar creature to you and bargain for its service. When you complete this performance, you call one or more outsiders as if using planar ally. Unlike with planar ally, the creature is not necessarily associated with your deity, and has an initial attitude of &#147;indifferent&#148; toward you. Because it is intrigued by your performance, it remains for up to 1 minute to hear the service you are requesting and the payment you are offering. If you succeed at an opposed Charisma check against the creature (with a +0 to +6 bonus on your roll based on the nature of the service and the offered reward), it agrees to perform the service. This ability otherwise works like planar ally.</p>
				<p>Though the best-known version of this masterpiece refers to an infernal bargain, it can be used to conjure any sort of extraplanar creature (such as an archon, elemental, or protean). Other versions and arrangements of this masterpiece may have different names but otherwise identical effects.</p>

				<p>Cost: Feat or 4th-level bard spell known.</p>
				<p>Effect: You begin your dance slowly, focusing on exact posture, the position of your limbs, even the direction of your gaze, then build to a blur of motion. Upon completing the performance, you summon a fixed aura of divine sunlight that glows in a 100-foot-radius circle centered on you.</p>
				<p>The divine sunlight acts as true daylight and affects creatures damaged or destroyed by such light. The light is as bright as sunlight at full noon and counters or dispels any darkness spells of 4th level or lower.

				<p>Prerequisite: Perform (keyboard, sing, string, or wind) 4 ranks.</p>
				<p>Cost: Feat or 2nd-level bard spell known.</p>
				<p>Effect: Whenever you end a bardic performance, you can add a quick reprise that makes it unnaturally catchy. Any creature within 30 feet of you when you finish your performance will run the risk of having your tune replaying endlessly in its mind. Unless the creature succeeds on a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your bard level + your Charisma modifier), the tune distracts it for 1 day per bard level. The creature takes a &#150;4 penalty on concentration checks, initiative checks, and Perception checks as long as it remains distracted. The creature&#146;s sleep also becomes fitful, requiring half again as long for the usual benefit and entirely negating the benefits of full bed rest beyond a normal rest. Once per day upon waking after rest, the creature can attempt a new Will saving throw to shake off the relentless reprise. If it fails, the creature takes 1d2 points of Wisdom damage (or 1d4 points of sanity damage if using the sanity rules from Horror Adventures). This is a curse effect with audible components.</p>

				<p>Note: This masterpiece can only be learned from the Song of Extinction (Music Box) artifact.</p>
				<p>The clarion of the end times, this masterpiece is a meticulous cacophony that ends all life.</p>
				<p>Prerequisite: Perform (sing, string, or wind) 15 ranks.</p>
				<p>Cost: Feat or 6th-level bard spell known.</p>
				<p>Effect: The area within 100 feet of the performer begins quaking and moaning as if the earth itself were in pain. The affected area is treated as per the spell earthquake. In addition, all creatures in the area except for the performer must make DC 25 Reflex saves, as individual earthen maws open beneath each. Those who fail fall into a 100-foot-deep pit that quickly grinds shut, trapping them as if they were in the bury zone of an avalanche and trapped without air. If any living, sentient creature is killed by the Song of Extinction&#146;s effects, the performer ceases to age for 1 year.</p>
				<p>Use: All of the performer&#146;s uses of bardic performance for that day.</p>

				<p>You recite inspirational lines from this epic poem commemorating the final stand at Storasta, keeping defiance alive even in the face of certain death.</p>
				<p>Prerequisite: Perform (oratory) or Perform (sing) 10 ranks.</p>
				<p>Cost: Feat or 4th-level bard spell known.</p>
				<p>Effect: When you complete the performance, all allies within 30 feet gain an attack of opportunity when reduced to negative hit points, or whenever a foe deals hit point damage equal to or greater than its Hit Dice, for the duration of the performance. The attack of opportunity can be made against any enemy within reach; it does not have to be against the source of the damage, and does not count toward your allies&#146; maximum attacks of opportunity per round. This attack of opportunity is resolved prior to the enemy&#146;s attack, but the triggering attack is still resolved even if the enemy is killed or incapacitated.</p>
				<p>Use: 2 bardic performance rounds per round.</p>

				<p>Prerequisite: Perform (sing) or Perform (percussion) 7 ranks.</p>
				<p>Cost: Feat or 3rd-level bard spell known.</p>
				<p>Effect: By singing or beating a drum, you set up a good rhythm for manual labor, helping those who hear it push against the limits of their strength more easily. Up to one creature per bard level that can see and hear you can ignore the effects of encumbrance and armor on its skill checks and movement while you engage in this performance.

				<p>Prerequisite: Perform (strings) 7 ranks.</p>
				<p>Cost: Feat or 3rd-level bard spell known.</p>
				<p>Effect: You play a soulful melody inspired by the legend in which a boy&#146;s prized horse, slain by a wicked lord, returns in spirit form and instructs the boy to construct an instrument from its body so that neither boy nor horse would be lonely. Upon the completion of this performance, you inspire the animal (or similar) companions, familiars, and mounts of allies who can hear the performance to avoid a similar fate, granting them the benefits of greater magic fang with a caster level equal to your bard level.</p>

				<p>Effect: At the end of the round on which you complete this song, all allies within 30 feet who observed your performance gain a new saving throw to end the ongoing effects of certain debilitating conditions. An ally who is exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, sickened, staggered, or stunned as the result of a previously failed saving throw can attempt a new saving throw to immediately end one of the above effects. Characters under multiple effects must choose which effect they wish to attempt to end prematurely. Effects that did not grant a save to resist (such as the stun effect of power word stun) can&#146;t be ended by this masterpiece.</p>
				<p>In addition, anyone who observed this performance gains the effects of delay poison at a caster level equal to your bard level.</p>

				<p>This elaborate arrangement for traditional elven instruments evokes Sylandurla&#146;s heroic climb up the spire from the planar city of Axis to the Boneyard, where it&#146;s said that she sang 8,008 tales to win elves their immunity to magical sleep.</p>
				<p>Prerequisite: Perform (percussion or wind) 7 ranks.</p>
				<p>Cost: Feat or 3rd-level bard spell known.</p>
				<p>Effect: All allies within 30 feet become immune to one of the following (your choice) while they can hear your performance: charm effects, the dazed condition, fear effects, magical sleep, paralysis, the staggered condition, or the stunned condition. You must choose the condition before activating the performance and can&#146;t change your choice during the performance. If any affected ally currently has the chosen condition, she can attempt a new saving throw against it each round she can hear your song. Success on this saving throw has its usual benefit, but failure has no effect at all. This performance relies on audible components.</p>

				<p>Effect: The sinisterly seductive song bores its way into the target&#146;s flesh, levitating it as per reverse gravity as long as the bard maintains the performance. Although the symphony does have words&#151;and is often sung in Infernal&#151;this is not a language-dependent effect.</p>

				<p>Cost: Feat or 3rd-level bard spell known.</p>
				<p>Effect: The complex arpeggios in this piece follow each other so quickly that the music can sound jumbled and disjointed at first. As the piece progresses, however, distinct phrases emerge, creating a wild but harmonious piece that inspires feelings of unfettered freedom. You and up to one ally per bard level within 30 feet who can hear you can move and attack normally for the duration of your performance, even if under the influence of magic that usually impedes movement. This effect is identical to that of freedom of movement, except that this masterpiece does not allow subjects to move and attack normally while underwater unless these creatures would already be able to do so, and only lasts as long as you continue the performance.</p>

				<p>Effect: In the Varisian musical The Bear, a lively tune plays whenever the eponymous animal tumbles onto stage. When played with skill, the song actually has the power to grant an animal temporary intelligence. Choose a non-hostile animal within line of sight that can see and hear you perform.

				<p>Prerequisite: Perform (dance) 5 ranks.</p>

				<p>Effect: This quick dance is a series of small steps culminating in a series of leaps. When you complete the performance, for the next 10 minutes you treat any distance fallen as if it were a number of feet shorter equal to half your bard level &#215; 5. You may spend the first minute of this effect demonstrating the dance to up to one creature per two bard levels; if these students succeed at a DC 15 Perform (dance) check, they also gain the benefits of this masterpiece for the remainder of its duration.</p>

				<p>This complex dance makes you difficult to strike.</p>
				<p>Prerequisite: Perform (dance) 4 ranks.</p>
				<p>Cost: Feat or 2nd-level bard spell known.</p>
				<p>Effect: The shuffling steps, bends, and leaps of this intricate dance make you a difficult target to hit, but also make it more difficult for you to perform other actions. When using this masterpiece, you take a &#150;2 penalty on melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks, and you must make a concentration check to cast any spell (DC 15 + the spell&#146;s level), but you gain a +2 dodge bonus to your Armor Class. When you have 8 ranks in Perform (dance), and every 4 ranks thereafter, the penalty increases by &#150;1 and the dodge bonus increases by +1. You can combine this masterpiece with fighting defensively and Combat Expertise, but not total defense. When you use this masterpiece, it lasts until the start of your next turn. Abilities that extend the duration of a bardic performance (such as Lingering Performance) affect this masterpiece; this allows you to get multiple rounds of its benefit (and its penalties) at the cost of only 1 round of bardic performance.</p>

				<p>Prerequisite: Perform (dance) 5 ranks.</p>
				<p>Cost: Feat or 2nd-level bard spell known.</p>
				<p>Effect: Your dance entices one creature within 30 feet that is able to see you, invoking every imaginable vice and craving until finally the desire the creature personally finds most appealing overwhelms its thoughts. You always know what your target wants, and, if you have the means to provide it, can offer it to the creature in exchange for a specific service. The creature can resist this effect with a successful Will saving throw, and creatures never agree if you offer services that are physically impossible or obviously suicidal, or if you lie about having the means to fulfill the desire in question. The service can never take more than a day to complete, and the affected creature gains a +2 bonus on its saving throw if the service requires more than an hour to complete.</p>

				<p>Prerequisite: Perform (percussion) 15 ranks or Perform (wind) 15 ranks.</p>
				<p>Cost: Feat or 5th-level bard spell known.</p>
				<p>Effect: Like a singer shattering a wine glass with a perfect note, your music cracks stone, shivering solid rock until it snaps. When you complete the performance, you create a tremor identical to an earthquake spell.</p>
				<p>For each round you continue to expend bardic performance rounds, the area experiences a round-long aftershock, which has the following effects.</p>
				<p>Caves, Caverns, or Tunnels: Smaller collapses cause 4d6 points of damage (Reflex DC 5 half ) and pin any creatures caught inside.</p>
				<p>Cliffs: More cliffs crumble, creating a landslide that travels half as far horizontally as it falls vertically. Any creature in the path takes 4d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 5 half ) and is pinned beneath the rubble.</p>
				<p>Open Ground: Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 5 Reflex save or fall down. Fissures open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25% chance of falling into one (Reflex DC 10 to avoid a fissure). The fissures are 20 feet deep, and these fissures remain open at the end of the quake.</p>
				<p>Pinned Beneath Rubble: Any creature pinned by the effects of the aftershock takes 1d3 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned. If a pinned character falls unconscious, she must make a DC 5 Constitution check or take 1d3 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead.</p>
				<p>Rivers, Lakes, or Marshes: The area drained away by the earthquake remains drained for the duration of the aftershock.</p>
				<p>Spellcasting: The concentration DC to cast during an aftershock is 15 + the spell&#146;s level.</p>
				<p>Structure: Any structure standing on open ground takes 50 points of damage. A collapsing structure deals 4d6 points of bludgeoning damage to creatures inside it (Reflex DC 5 half ), and the creatures inside are pinned beneath the rubble.</p>
				<p>Use: 10 rounds of bardic performance, +1 round for each round of aftershocks.</p>

				<p>Prerequisite: Perform (act) or Perform (comedy) 6 ranks.</p>
				<p>Cost: Feat or 2nd-level spell known.</p>
				<p>Effect: This pantomime tells the tale of Gorroc, a foolish farmer who failed to control the weeds that grew so quickly upon his land. In desperation, Gorroc bargained with a devil, who blasted the earth with salt and withering heat, leaving the fertile land desolate for a century. When you complete the performance, you can create a 30-foot cone or a 60-foot line that is blasted with scorching air and hot salt. Plants and oozes in this area take 1d6 points of damage per bard level (maximum 10d6); half this damage is fire damage, half is piercing damage. A Reflex save reduces the damage by half. Creatures other than plants or oozes take half damage, or no damage on a successful save.</p>

				<p>You can trap opponents with the power of your acting.</p>
				<p>Prerequisite: Perform (act) 10 ranks.</p>
				<p>Cost: Feat or 4th-level bard spell known.</p>
				<p>Effect: You silently mime building an invisible wall, flattening your hands along linear planes to indicate its location and orientation. This &#147;wall&#148; is only real for creatures that see you perform this masterpiece (Will negates); you and your allies may automatically fail your saves if you want to treat the wall as real (for example, if you want to use the wall as a bridge to cross a chasm). For creatures who believe the wall is real, it has hardness 8, 90 hit points, and a break DC of 30 (multiple believing creatures can attack the walls, breaking through it more quickly as if they were all attacking a real wall rather than each attacking separate mental constructs). This is an illusion (phantasm) effect. Because the wall is a mental image, it blocks incorporeal creatures that fail their saves (because they perceive it as a magical barrier that excludes them), though they can still go around the wall or through the floor or ceiling to bypass it. It does not affect objects or creatures immune to mental effects (which can result in situations like an archer firing through the wall but unable to physically cross it).</p>
				<p>You can create one 10-foot-square wall per use of this ability; over several rounds you can extend this square or create other walls, all of which persist until you stop using bardic performance rounds to sustain them. The wall is immobile once created. Part of the wall must be in or along the edge of your space, and you cannot create a wall that extends beyond your natural reach (though you can create a wall, move, and create another by using this ability again). Once created, the wall exists until you end your performance or affected creatures &#147;break&#148; it. Abilities that extend the duration of a bardic performance (such as Lingering Performance) affect this masterpiece.</p>

				<p>Prerequisite: Perform (oratory) 10 ranks or Perform (sing) 10 ranks.</p>
				<p>Cost: Feat or 3rd-level bard spell known.</p>
				<p>Effect: This piece tells the story of a mighty priest-king who seemed to defy time by snatching near-victory from an overwhelming number of enemies. When you complete the performance, you gain the ability to accelerate time once, which must be used in the next 10 minutes. When you perform this masterpiece, you gain the ability to spend a swift action to perform a nonmagical action that normally requires a move action or a standard action. For example, you could make a full attack, then spend a swift action to take a normal move, load a light crossbow, or draw a weapon in the same round. You must use this extra action within 10 minutes of performing the masterpiece; otherwise the benefit is lost.</p>
				<p>This ability does not stack with other effects that increase your speed (such as haste) or alter time (such as time stop).</p>
				<p>Your allies may benefit from this masterpiece, but they must listen to it intently (to the exclusion of all other activities) for the duration of the performance, and you must expend 1 round of bardic performance for each ally other than yourself whom you want to gain the ability to accelerate time (for example, affecting yourself and five others requires expending 11 rounds of bardic performance). This is a language-dependent effect.</p>
				<p>Use: 5 bardic performance rounds, +1 round per additional person affected.</p>

				<p>Effect: Your song emulates the sounds of a terrible illness, causing one creature you are aware of who can hear your song to develop a psychosomatic flu. If the target fails its Will save, whenever it attempts any action other than moving up to its base speed or making a single melee attack (but not both) in a single round, it must succeed at a concentration check (DC 10 + your Charisma modifier) to avoid wasting its action because of a fit of coughing and sneezing.</p>

				<p>Effect: You create a feeling of deceptive confidence in an enemy.

If you target a creature that has not yet acted in a surprise round, the creature does not get to act in the surprise round. Any target with the uncanny dodge class feature or an ability with a similar effect is immune to this performance. This is a mind-affecting emotion effect.</p>
				<p>Use: 1 bardic performance round per round.</p>
				<p>Action: 1 standard action.</p>

				<p>Prerequisite: Perform (dance) 10 ranks.</p>
				<p>Cost: Feat or 4th-level bard spell known.</p>
				<p>Effect: You enact a series of graceful, measured steps that your enemies cannot help but mimic. When you complete the performance, any foe within 60 feet that can see you is slowed (as per the slow spell) for as long as you continue the performance. A Will saving throw negates this effect.</p>
				<p>Each round you continue the performance, each slowed creature within 60 feet (whether slowed by this masterpiece or by another effect) must succeed at another Will saving throw or its penalty on attack rolls, AC, and Reflex saves increases by 1 as the slow dance movements overtake it. This increased penalty lasts as long as you continue the performance. A creature that succeeds at this Will saving throw merely avoids increasing the penalty for that round; success does not remove the effect that slowed it.</p>

				<p>Effect: This short monologue tells the story of a village priest who thought to command the gods. This so annoyed the gods of the weather that they gave him exactly what he wished for, and the priest&#146;s long-winded sermons tore apart his temple and scattered his parishioners. When you complete the performance, you conjure a great wind as if you had cast control winds.</p>

				<p>Prerequisite: Perform (keyboard) or Perform (wind) 4 ranks.</p>
				<p>Cost: Feat or 2nd-level bard spell known.</p>
				<p>Effect: The complex notes and layered repetitions of this masterpiece bring to mind the countless dead of ages past and suffuse those who listen to it with a subtle melancholia and grim acceptance of the temporary nature of life. Starting with a trio of notes, repeated frequently and with evergreater insistence, it becomes a whirling, head-spinning vortex of sound. Upon completing the performance, you and up to one ally per level within listening range become hidden from undead, as if under the effects of a hide from undead spell.</p>
				<p>As with hide from undead, one creature breaking the effect ends the benefit of the performance for all recipients. But by spending an additional round of bardic performance when you perform or maintain the masterpiece, you can dedicate a refrain to a particular ally; even if one ally breaks the hide from undead effect, the ally receiving the dedication remains hidden so long as he does not break the effect himself. You can dedicate a refrain multiple times in the performance (up to once per round) as long as you spend 1 round of bardic performance each time for the ally receiving a dedication.</p>
				<p>Use: 1 bardic performance round per round of the performance, +1 round per ally affected, +1 round per dedicated refrain.</p>

				<p>Effect: This bright and spritely tune mimics the sound of human feet, slowly building to a steady, ground-eating pace. When you complete this performance, you affect one ally in hearing range per bard level. This masterpiece increases the affected target&#146;s base land speed by 10 feet for 1 hour. This adjustment is treated as an enhancement bonus. There is no effect on other modes of movement, such as burrow, climb, fly, or swim.

				<p>Effect: You provide an impassioned monologue from the point of view of a noble queen, voicing her inner turmoil at being betrayed by her own sister and calling for justice to strike from the heavens. If you perform this masterpiece with the Perform (sing) skill, it is a tempestuous aria instead of a rousing soliloquy.</p>
				<p>Upon completing the performance, you may conjure bolts of lightning as though you had cast call lightning storm, except the bolts are made of elemental thunder and deal sonic damage rather than electricity damage. The bolts do not increase in damage if outdoors in a stormy area. Instead, in any environment, you may attempt a DC 25 Perform check as part of the standard action to call a bolt.

				<p>Effect: When you complete the performance, one creature within 30 feet is affected by beast shape I.

				<p>Effect: You begin an epic tale of kings and queens in ages past, recounting their lineages and sage deeds. The epic has no fixed form and has substantial room for improvisation; many bards include tales of their own wise ancestors, or the ancestors of noteworthy members of their audience. When you activate the performance, one target creature other than you within close range (25 feet + 5 feet/2 levels) gains the benefit of a commune spell. You must continue the performance for the target to receive answers, as your retelling is magically guided to include relevant responses. If you cease the performance before the target has asked all of its questions, or if you run out of bardic performance rounds, any remaining questions are lost.</p>

The black blood transfusion persists until it negates one positive energy healing effect, but it can be removed sooner with a successful DC 25 Heal check.</p>

				<h>Expanded Bloodlines</h>
				<p>Chromatic and metallic dragons remain the most common dragons to impart their legacy onto other species. The bloodrager and sorcerer classes each include a draconic bloodline that assumes the character&#146;s lineage is somehow connected with the power of a chromatic or metallic dragon. Presented below are expanded options for the existing draconic bloodlines, increasing the selection of heritages to include the numerous new true dragons presented in the many Pathfinder RPG Bestiary volumes. Each of the draconic bloodlines below alters the bloodrager&#146;s or sorcerer&#146;s bloodline arcana.</p>
				<p><b>Energy Types: </b>Several of these new draconic bloodline options include nonstandard damage types. For the sake of game balance, many of the damage types available to the bloodlines below somewhat differ from those produced by the parent dragon. Specifically, force energy, negative energy, and sonic energy have been altered to different types of energy. In cases where a dragon&#146;s energy type is listed as physical damage (such as bludgeoning or piercing), use that damage type when determining your breath weapon damage. For the purpose of the dragon resistance bloodline power, you gain DR equal to half the energy resistance you would normally gain against all attacks of that specific damage type. A character with the power of wyrms bloodline power gains immunity to her bloodline&#146;s damage type. For all other purposes, such as archetypes, bloodline powers, and feats, treat that dragon&#146;s energy type as fire.</p>
				<h>Esoteric Dragons</h>
				<p>Though many of the enigmatic esoteric dragons remain aloof or intentionally distant from mortal affairs, occult dragons are the most likely to imprint their bloodline onto humanoids. Often such draconic blood is the result of ongoing experimentation. Scions of other esoteric dragons are far more unusual; such bloodlines usually result from explorers traveling the realms where these distant dragons dwell and being exposed to some spectacular and illunderstood power.</p>
				<p><b>Variant Bloodline Arcana: </b>When selecting spells known, you can choose spells from the psychic class spell list (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 69). The psychic spells you select must normally be unavailable to your class. You can know only a number of psychic spells equal to the highest level spell you can cast from your class spell list, based on your current class level. When you&#146;re casting these spells, they function as psychic magic instead of arcane. You use thought and emotion components (Occult Adventures 144) instead of verbal and somatic components when casting these spells.</p>

				<h>Imperial Dragons</h>
				<p>The blood of imperial dragons is well known throughout the lands of Tian Xia, where such dragons form a strong part of much of the continent&#146;s mythology. This is particularly true in Xa Hoi, where imperial dragons rule. Imperial dragons in other lands may vary in their interactions with humanoids, but universally accept the praise (and fear) of those around them. Their connection to the land makes the blood of these dragons a powerful arcane catalyst in the making of heroes.</p>
				<p><b>Variant Bloodline Arcana: </b>Whenever you cast a spell that affects a creature with the shaken, frightened, or panicked condition, increase the spell&#146;s save DC by 1.</p>

				<h>Outer Dragons</h>
				<p>The interests of outer dragons take them across the cosmos. Strange devices or experimentation are most likely to lead to the addition of outer dragon blood into a world&#146;s ecosystem. The hidden blood of an outer dragon in a family&#146;s lineage is difficult to detect or stamp out. On Golarion, these dragons most commonly find themselves drawn to the fabled land of Numeria and its alien technology, though they usually refuse to share any of their insights with that nation&#146;s residents.</p>
				<p><b>Variant Bloodline Arcana: </b>Whenever you cast a spell with an energy descriptor that matches your draconic bloodline&#146;s energy type, if a creature is damaged by the spell, that creature cannot take a 5-foot step for 1 round. This effect occurs only when you&#146;re using spells that require an attack roll (such as chill touch or scorching ray) or spells that allow a save (such as fireball or lightning bolt). A successful save against the damage or effects of the spell also negates this additional effect.</p>

				<h>Primal Dragons</h>
				<p>Born from the elemental planes or the Shadow Plane, primal dragons are infused with primeval power. These dragons traveled to the Material Plane in ages past, and many of their kind continue to spread their blood and magical influence among the humanoid races of the world. Even the malign umbral dragons prosper in the caverns of the Darklands and the mountains of Nidal. Any exposure to or experimentation with primal magics may introduce primal dragon blood into a lineage.</p>
				<p><b>Variant Bloodline Arcana: </b>Whenever you cast a spell with an energy descriptor that matches your draconic bloodline&#146;s energy type, you can reroll a number of damage dice equal to half the spell&#146;s level.</p>

				<p>Cavaliers belonging to the order of the asp belong to a cutthroat group where ruthless pragmatism and underhanded dealing are the keys to moving up the chain of command. They tend to be brutal, self-centered leaders who reap confidence from their subordinates&#146; misery.</p>
				<p><b>Edicts: </b>An order of the asp cavalier must endeavor to enhance her prestige, wealth, and power, as well as that of her patrons. She must endeavor to maximize her profits and efficiency, directing hirelings and even sacrificing them when doing so would further her goals and make her appear exceptional by comparison.</p>
				<p><b>Challenge: </b>Whenever an order of the asp cavalier issues a challenge, she receives a +1 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls made against the target of the challenge so long as it is entangled, exhausted, fatigued, flanked, nauseated, prone, shaken, staggered, or denied its Dexterity bonus to AC. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels the cavalier has.</p>
				<p><b>Skills: </b>An order of the asp cavalier adds Knowledge (local) and Sleight of Hand to her list of class skills. The cavalier gains a bonus on Knowledge (local) checks equal to half her cavalier level (minimum +1) as long as the check involves her patrons or organization.

The allies&#146; positioning and actions must still meet the prerequisites listed in the teamwork feat for the cavalier to receive the listed bonus.

The ally must have the shaken condition or have no more than half the Hit Dice of the cavalier, and the ally gains a Reflex save to negate this ability&#146;s effect entirely (DC = 10 + half the cavalier&#146;s level + the higher of her Strength modifier or Charisma modifier). If the attack hits, the damage is split evenly between the cavalier and the ally. If the ally&#146;s save was a natural 1, the ally takes all of the damage, including any associated effects (bleed, poison, etc.). An ally can purposefully fail this saving throw, but cannot purposefully roll a natural 1.</p>

				<p>A cavalier belonging to this order seeks only destruction and chaos. Cavaliers of the order of the beast revel in destruction, and go out of their way to cause as much mayhem and disorder as possible. While some celebrate war and a victory well fought, an order of the beast cavalier fights only to taste the blood of his dying foe. Members of this order are often insane, and may venerate Rovagug or the elder gods and Great Old Ones of the Dark Tapestry. There are no colleges or universities where an aspiring cavalier can learn the ways of the order of the beast; it is a corruption of the other cavalier orders, and its secrets are whispered in the dreams of unbalanced youths by dark beings and passed down in forbidden rituals.</p>
				<p>On Golarion, order of the beast cavaliers are most often found leading orc tribes on raids from within the Hold of Belkzen, commanding small bands of brigands or raiders in the Mana Wastes, or sowing chaos anywhere a destructive leader is welcomed or venerated, particularly in lands where the law holds little sway.</p>
				<p><b>Edicts: </b>The cavalier wreaks havoc wherever he goes. An order of the beast cavalier must never show mercy and, when crossed, exacts the maximum possible revenge. The cavalier must seek out conflict at every juncture and cannot avoid a fight if provoked. That which he cannot steal, pillage, or claim, he must completely destroy or desecrate.</p>
				<p><b>Challenge: </b>Whenever an order of the beast cavalier issues a challenge, he receives a +1 morale bonus on all damage rolls while using Cleave or Great Cleave so long as the target of his challenge is the first creature attacked. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels the cavalier possesses.</p>
				<p><b>Skills: </b>An order of the beast cavalier adds Disable Device (Dex) and Stealth (Dex) to his list of class skills. An order of the beast cavalier can make Disable Device checks untrained. If he has ranks in the skill, he receives a bonus on the check equal to 1/2 his cavalier level (minimum +1) when using it to sabotage, jam, or destroy a device.</p>

The cavalier receives no Constitution check to stabilize while using this ability, and automatically takes 1 point of damage each round. When his current negative hit points exceed his negative Constitution score, the amount of damage he must deal to continue to act is now equal to the difference between his current negative hit point total and his negative Constitution score. Additionally, the cavalier can no longer benefit from magical healing (save for a wish or miracle spell), and he immediately dies once he can no longer take an action due to this ability.</p>

			<text type="formattedtext">
				<p>While most samurai belong to the order of the warrior, dedicating their considerable skills to the service of a lord, land, and people, some find themselves without a master, either as a result of disgrace or death, or occasionally by choice. Known as ronin, these samurai wander the lands, serving their own code of ideals. While ronin are significantly freer to do as they please, they do not receive the same respect and support that a more dedicated samurai can count on. Note that cavaliers can select this order, but they are typically called knights errant instead of ronin.</p>
				<p><b>Becoming Ronin: </b>Normally, when a samurai wishes to change his order, he must undergo a lengthy process that requires him to adhere to the edicts of his new order for a period of time before receiving any benefits. This is not the case with ronin. Once a samurai decides to become a ronin, he immediately loses all of the bonuses, skills, and abilities of his old order and gains those of the ronin order. If he wishes to once again dedicate himself to another order, he must do so using the normal rules.</p>
				<p><b>Edicts: </b>Ronin follow their own personal code of ethics and honor. As such, their edicts are extremely flexible and subject to change. Each ronin should determine his own edicts, which should include at least three provisions. These edicts are subject to GM approval.</p>
				<p><b>Challenge: </b>Whenever a ronin is the target of a challenge, a smite, a quarry, or similar effect, and he issues a challenge against that character in return, the ronin receives a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls made against the target of his challenge and a +1 dodge bonus to his AC against attacks made by the target of his challenge. These bonuses increase by +1 for every four class levels the samurai possesses (to a maximum of +6 at 20th level).</p>
				<p><b>Skills: </b>A ronin adds Knowledge (local) (Int) and Survival (Wis) to his list of class skills.</p>

				<p>At 2nd level, the ronin learns to rely solely on himself, even in the most difficult of times. Whenever the ronin fails a Will saving throw against an effect with a duration greater than 1 round, he can attempt another saving throw at the end of the second round of the effect. If he makes this saving throw, it has the same effect as if he had made the original save (negating part or all of the effect). In addition, whenever a ronin is brought below 0 hit points, on his next turn he can roll twice to stabilize, taking the better result.</p>

				<p>At 8th level, the ronin's fierce independence allows him to overcome staggering odds. The ronin can summon up this willpower as an immediate action, and can use it in one of three ways. He can use his willpower whenever an attack would reduce him to fewer than 0 hit points but wouldn't kill him, to instead be at 1 hit point and conscious. He can use his willpower after making an attack roll to confirm a critical hit in order to reroll the confirmation roll. Finally, he can use his willpower to take 10 on a skill check during combat, even if the situation or the skill would not normally allow him to take 10. A ronin can use this ability once during a combat.</p>

				<p>At 2nd level, the cavalier can prepare for the terrain through which he will be traveling with 48 hours of study and customization of his equipment. He can select any terrain type from the list available to a ranger for his favored terrain class feature. While in the selected terrain, the cavalier gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and on Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks. At 8th level and every 6 levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1. Additionally, when calculating overland movement speed in the selected terrain, the cavalier and his mount treat trackless terrain as though it contains a road or trail, and terrain with a road or trail as though it were a highway. If traveling along a highway, the cavalier and his mount can travel for 10 hours before needing to attempt Constitution checks for a forced march.</p>

When moving toward his ward, the cavalier and his mount increase their speed by 10 feet. At 12th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the bonus on attack and damage rolls and on saving throws increases by 1 and the bonus to speed increases by 5 feet.</p>

				<p>A cavalier of the order of the flame devotes his life to the pursuit of personal glory. Even if such pursuit puts his own life on the line, the cavalier pursues legendary status and the fame and glory associated with such renown.</p>
				<p><b>Edicts: </b>The cavalier must pursue glory for himself and those with whom he associates. He must strive to heap glory upon his name, no matter the costs. He must challenge and defeat an ever-increasing host of rivals to further cement his illustrious reputation.</p>
				<p><b>Challenge: </b>A cavalier of the order of the flame becomes ever more emboldened with each glorious victory. As an immediate action after reducing the target of his challenge to 0 hit points or fewer, the cavalier can elect to issue a glorious challenge to an opponent within 15 feet.</p>
				<p><b>Glorious Challenge: </b>A glorious challenge does not count against the cavalier&#146;s number of challenges per day, but otherwise acts like a cavalier&#146;s challenge class feature. When he issues a glorious challenge, the cavalier takes a &#150;2 penalty to AC for the duration of the glorious challenge (this penalty stacks with the usual &#150;2 AC penalty against opponents other than the target of the cavalier&#146;s challenge). The cavalier gains a morale bonus on melee damage rolls against the target of his glorious challenge equal to 2 &#215; the number of consecutive glorious challenges he has issued thus far. As long as he continues to defeat targets of his glorious challenges and there are more opponents in range, the cavalier can continue to issue glorious challenges indefinitely, with the penalty to AC and the bonus on damage rolls increasing with each subsequent foe. For example, a 5th-level cavalier that has just issued his third glorious challenge after defeating the original target of his challenge takes a &#150;6 penalty to AC (&#150;8 against creatures other than the target of his glorious challenge) and gains a +11 bonus on melee damage rolls (a +5 bonus from his base challenge ability plus a +6 morale bonus for three consecutive glorious challenges).</p>
				<p><b>Skills: </b>A cavalier of the order of the flame adds Knowledge (local) and Survival to his class skills. Whenever the cavalier&#146;s current hit point total matches or exceeds his maximum hit point total, he gains a bonus on Intimidate checks equal to 1/2 his cavalier level (minimum +1).</p>

				<p>Cavaliers belonging to this order have joined the Hellknight crusade against chaos, adopting a life of ironclad discipline and swearing to thwart disorder by any means. Through intimidation and strength of arms, these severe warriors embody the grim fist of law, pursuing and crushing disorder wherever it festers. Many strike out from one of the Hellknights&#146; stark, black citadels. Others roam between cities and villages, serving as judges and emissaries of a harsh vision of justice (see the circuit judge cavalier archetype). Like other Hellknights, most members of this order begin their service by undergoing training at a Hellknight citadel or instruction from a true Hellknight. Most eventually pursue levels in the Hellknight prestige class, looking ahead to the day when they will face their lethal test against the forces of Hell. Until then, members of the order of the Ennead Star are typically Hellknight armigers or other initiates with dispensation to quest and quell disorder wherever they might find it. Regardless of his own goals, each cavalier is associated with a specific group of Hellknights and rigidly follows its unbending strictures. Members of the order of the Ennead Star are most commonly found in the lands of Absalom, Cheliax, Isger, Rahadoum, and Varisia, but the cavaliers&#146; goals might take members anywhere across the Inner Sea region.</p>
				<p><b>Edicts: </b>The cavalier is a merciless champion of the law, and if he must crush dreams, coerce obedience, or slay in the name of law, that is a small price to pay for peace and progress. The cavalier must bring lawbreakers to justice, and when that is not possible, he must serve as executioner of that justice. He must also uphold the tenets of his Hellknight order.</p>
				<p><b>Challenge: </b>An order of the Ennead Star cavalier gains bonuses when he challenges a creature of chaotic alignment with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher or one that the cavalier has witnessed committing a crime against local laws within the past hour.

				<p><b>Skills: </b>An order of the Ennead Star cavalier adds Knowledge (local) (Int) and Perception (Wis) to his list of class skills. Additionally, he gains a circumstance bonus on Perception checks to act in a surprise round equal to 1/2 his cavalier level (minimum +1).</p>

				<p>Hobgoblins have long taken advantage of the tactical edge darkvision gives them when fighting in darkness, particularly against elves, humans, and samsarans. As the ruling class of Kaoling, hobgoblin samurai have adopted the benefit of darkness as a spiritual alliance that forms a guiding principle in not only how they fight, but every aspect of their lives. This has given rise to the order of the eclipse, a respected samurai order devoted to darkness itself. Although the order is not officially restricted to hobgoblins, its edicts make it difficult for any samurai without darkvision to operate in its ranks.</p>
				<p><b>Edicts: </b>The samurai cannot create light where it is not necessary&#151;anything that can be done in darkness should be. The samurai must belong to a military organization (within Kaoling this is likely to be a warband commanded by a senior samurai, who in turn answers to Warlord Tsung-cha Kavangaki or one of the Council of Nine). The samurai must enforce his place within this order and societies that recognize its authority, obeying those senior to him without question and demanding total obedience from those beneath him. The samurai must take every opportunity to extinguish the lights of his foes.</p>
				<p><b>Challenge: </b>The order of the eclipse samurai gains a +1 bonus on all Intimidate checks made against the target of his challenge. This bonus increases by 1 for every four levels the samurai possesses.</p>
				<p><b>Skills: </b>An order of the eclipse samurai adds Perception (Wis) and Survival (Wis) to his list of class skills. In addition, whenever he makes a Perception check to notice an invisible creature or object, he receives a bonus on the check equal to 1/2 his samurai level (minimum +1).</p>

				<p>The cavaliers of the order of the blue rose dedicate themselves to promoting peace in the lands they roam. Skilled warriors and adept diplomats, these cavaliers counsel wisdom, patience, and understanding, but are ever mindful of the need to take up arms to strike down aggressors, tyrants, or evil usurpers. Although they believe wholeheartedly in peace as an aim and a final goal, cavaliers of the blue rose are warriors first, and embrace their role as guardians of those who cannot or will not take up arms to defend themselves.</p>
				<p><b>Edicts: </b>The cavalier must guard against needless violence, protecting both the land and its people from wars they neither started nor wish to fight. He must seek to stop conflict with a minimum of bloodshed, to encourage peaceful resolutions to disagreements between intelligent creatures, and to mend the wounds opened by battle. He must also honor quarter when he gives it, protecting captives who have surrendered from his own allies if need be.</p>
				<p><b>Challenge: </b>Whenever an order of the blue rose cavalier issues a challenge, he receives a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls made against the target of his challenge, if the target is an intelligent creature to whom the cavalier offered the chance to surrender (by taking a standard action to offer terms).

When the cavalier makes use of this ability, he must attempt to subdue his target without killing it; dealing lethal damage after using this ability, or allowing his allies to kill the target, is considered a violation of his edicts.</p>

				<p>Cavaliers of the order of the blossom dedicate their lives to protecting fey, especially those visiting the Material Plane from the First World. These cavaliers might be fey themselves, but even if they aren&#146;t, they exhibit the same whimsy and occasionally cruel sense of humor typical of most denizens of the First World.</p>
				<p><b>Edicts: </b>The cavalier cannot refuse a fey&#146;s request for aid unless it will interfere with his existing duties, or he believes the fey seeks to directly oppose his other aims and goals. He must strive to prevent gates to the First World from being exploited or corrupted. If the cavalier encounters blighted fey or other corrupted fey, he must strive to destroy them.</p>
				<p><b>Challenge: </b>Whenever an order of the blossom cavalier issues a challenge, the target of the challenge takes a &#150;1 penalty on saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities used by fey or by the cavalier. This penalty increases by 1 for every 4 levels the cavalier has. An order of the blossom cavalier can&#146;t issue a challenge against any creature of the fey type unless that creature has the blighted fey template.</p>
				<p><b>Skills: </b>An order of the blossom cavalier adds Disguise and Knowledge (nature) to his list of class skills.

The saving throw DC for these spell-like abilities is 10 + half the cavalier&#146;s level + his Charisma modifier.

In addition, whenever he confirms a critical hit against a target under an enchantment effect, that target is confused for 1d6 rounds. Each round the confused creature rolls to determine its action, it rolls twice and the cavalier chooses which result to use. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>

If the cavalier&#146;s mount has trample from another source, damage from the mount&#146;s trample attack instead increases as though the mount were one size category larger (see Table 3&#150;1 on page 302 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary); this does not alter the damage dealt by the mount&#146;s slam attack. A creature that attempts a Reflex saving throw to avoid damage from the mount&#146;s trample attack provokes an attack of opportunity from the cavalier.</p>

				<p>At 15th level, the cavalier becomes an unstoppable engine of destruction. If the cavalier&#146;s current hit points drop below 0, he does not fall unconscious. Instead, he continues to act so long as his negative hit point total does not exceed the amount of damage he dealt to an enemy on a single melee attack during the last round. The cavalier receives no Constitution check to stabilize while using this ability, and automatically takes 1 point of damage each round. When his current negative hit points exceed his negative Constitution score, the amount of damage he must deal to continue to act is now equal to the difference between his current negative hit point total and his negative Constitution score. Additionally, the cavalier can no longer benefit from magical healing (save for a wish or miracle spell), and he immediately dies once he can no longer take an action due to this ability.</p>

				<p>At 8th level, an order of the of the beast cavalier gains the ability to turn his mount into a different Medium or Large animal and back again once per day.

The effect lasts for 1 hour per cavalier level, or until the cavalier chooses to change his mount back. Changing the mount&#146;s form (to a different animal or back to normal) requires the cavalier to touch his mount as a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal the cavalier is familiar with. The mount does not change size, but does receive the bonuses (not the penalty) presented in beast shape II for the Large animal.</p>
				<p>The cavalier can use this ability an additional time per day at 10th level and every 4 levels thereafter (to a maximum of four times per day at 18th level).</p>

				<p>While the church of Asmodeus periodically endorses the use of possession for certain reasons, it is usually vehemently against unsanctioned possession and the creation of uncontrolled undead forces. Asmodeans have a particular hatred for celestials who partake in acts of possession. Such outsiders are hunted down, and the Church of Asmodeus may offer its exorcising agents&#146; services pro bono for the chance to strike at a particularly hated celestial. The eventual consequence of such arrangements&#151;often left unsaid&#151;is that Asmodeans track those they have helped in this way, and often return to force those individuals to host a devil for a period of predetermined length as recompense for their prior service.</p>
				<p><b>Deceptive Reprieve (Sp): </b>When you touch a creature under direct mental control (such as that granted via dominate person, but not via charm person) or the victim of possession, that creature can attempt a new Will save against the control or possession effect with a +2 bonus. If the creature succeeds, the effect or possession is temporarily halted, as per protection from evil, for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your character level.

				<p><b>Associated Domain(s) </b>: Repose</p>
				<p>The Lady of Graves seeks the destruction of undead, be they corporeal or manifested spirits. Inquisitors of Pharasma scour the world for signs of the undead, destroying such abominations on sight by means both traditional and esoteric in nature. As a result, most people come first to the church of Pharasma when seeking assistance against foul spirits. One unusual facet of Pharasma&#146;s faithful is their reluctance to excise non-undead spirits, such as demons or devils. Only the most altruistic of Pharasmin priests offer their services against possessing outsiders, as most faithful see battling such foes as being beyond their true calling.</p>
				<p><b>Exorcism of Undeath (Sp): </b>Once per day as a full-round action, you can try to end any possession spells or effects, or effects that directly exercise mental control over a creature, as long as the effect was caused by an undead creature. You must touch the affected creature (this requires a melee touch attack if the target is neither willing nor helpless) and use a vial of holy water as a material component that is consumed as part of using this ability. The target must immediately attempt a new Will save against the original save DC of the controlling effect. If the save is successful, the possession effect immediately ends, as if the target had succeeded at its original saving throw. If the possessing force is a ghost or similar undead, it manifests adjacent to the target and is staggered for 1 round.</p>

				<p>As a standard action, you can cause the ground in a 5-foot-radius burst centered on you to sprout twisting, thorny vines. Any creature moving through it must travel at half speed or take bleed damage equal to half your cleric level; if you activate this ability in an area with numerous plants (grass, weeds, trees, etc.), the area also becomes difficult terrain.

				<p>At 8th level, you can impart a shared vision of unfathomable ineffability to a living creature you touch as a standard action, after which your turn immediately ends. You are dazed and the target confused for 1 round by what you both learn. On the following round, you are both staggered for 1 round by the ramifications of your discovery. On the third round, you are confused and the target dazed for 1 round as you attempt to regain your bearings. Each round, the target can attempt a Will save with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your Wisdom modifier to negate that round&#146;s effects for both of you, though the effect does not end until the end of the third round. This is a mindaffecting effect that you can use a number of times per day equal to 1/2 your class level.</p>

				<p>If you have the spell rune domain power, you can attach a spell effect to the prohibition as if it were the spell rune domain ability; the spell takes effect if the creature performs the named action. This spell must be of at least 1 level lower than the highest-level cleric spell you can cast, and it must target one or more creatures. Regardless of the number of targets the spell can normally affect, it affects only the creature that triggers the rune. Attaching a spell in this way extends the duration of the prohibition by a number of rounds equal to the spell&#146;s level, or until it is discharged.</p>

				<p>As a standard action, you can stretch out your hand toward any visible fire source within 60 feet and beckon it toward you. This causes a ribbon-thin streak of fire to approach you in a straight line through the air. Any creature directly in the fire ribbon&#146;s path takes 1d4 points of fire damage; a successful Reflex save (DC = 10 + half your class level + your Wisdom modifier) negates this damage. When the ribbon of fire reaches your hand, it either extinguishes or lights a flammable object of your choice that you&#146;re holding. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>

				<p>A risen spirit is akin to a plant that must be tended. Such are the teachings of Urgathoa, the goddess who is believed to be the first undead creature. Unlike many of her deific counterparts, Urgathoa champions the shepherding and protection of haunts and possessing spirits, even to the danger and detriment of her own followers. The faithful of the Pallid Princess believe that by prolonging the torment and tortured existence of a spirit, they create something akin to a beautiful piece of artwork. In a similar manner, servants of Urgathoa view the possession of a mortal body by a deceased spirit as a blessing.</p>
				<p><b>Necrotic Tending (Sp): </b>You can touch an undead creature or area affected by a haunt as a standard action, restoring 1d8 hit points + 1 for every 2 cleric levels you have. This ability has no effect on other creatures. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>
				<p>This replaces the bleeding touch domain power of the Death domain.</p>

If the item is not magical, or if your caster level is greater than the item&#146;s caster level, this damage bypasses the item&#146;s hardness.

			<name type="string">Druid Herbalism</name>
			<text type="formattedtext">
				<p>Instead of granting access to a domain or an animal companion, a druid&#146;s bond with nature can take a third form: access to druidic herbalism.</p>
				<p>Druidic herbalism is a nature bond option that can be taken by any druid at 1st level except those with archetypes or alternate class features that alter or replace nature bond or mandate a specific nature bond choice.</p>
				<p>A druid who chooses to learn druidic herbalism can use combinations of nuts, berries, dried herbs, and other natural ingredients along with appropriate containers to create herbal concoctions or magic consumables that function like potions. This acts like the Brew Potion feat, but only for spells on the druid spell list. Herbal concoctions are typically thick and sludgy, and their creation time, caster level, spell duplication capabilities, and all other variables and properties are identical to those of potions created using Brew Potion. Herbal concoctions created with herbs that cause special effects when ingested (see page 10 of Pathfinder Player Companion: Heroes of the Wild) retain those effects as well as the appropriate spell effect.</p>
				<p>A druid can create a number of free herbal concoctions per day equal to her Wisdom modifier. Additional concoctions cost the same as creating an equivalent potion using Brew Potion. Druids can sell their herbal concoctions just as if they were potions (though NPCs unfamiliar with druidic herbalism may need some convincing before purchasing these wares).</p>
				<p>At 4th level, a druid&#146;s increasing skill with herbalism means that she can disguise the effects of her herbal concoctions. When a creature attempts a Perception or Spellcraft check to identify one of the druid&#146;s concoctions, the concoction appears to be a different herbal concoction of the druid&#146;s choice unless the creature exceeds the identification DC by 5 or more. The druid must designate this false result when creating the concoction. If a creature exceeds the identification DC by 5 or more, it correctly identifies the concoction, though not that the druid tried to fool it.</p>
				<p>Additionally, at 4th level, when the druid creates additional concoctions, she need pay only half the normal cost to create them. It takes her only half the normal time to create her concoctions, and she can create concoctions of spells from any spell list, as long as she can cast the spell. At 7th level, when the druid creates concoctions with potential false identification results, a creature attempting to identify the concoction must exceed the identification DC by 10 or more to determine the concoction&#146;s true identity.</p>
				<p>Additionally, at 7th level, a druid can create any herbal concoction in 1 minute. She can also create a special concoction of any spell higher than 3rd level that she can cast, but to do so, she must expend a spell slot of the same level. These special concoctions do not cost her anything to create and function like extracts created by an alchemist with the infusion discovery.</p>

				<p>When damage would cause the fighter or an adjacent ally to be knocked unconscious or killed, as a swift or immediate action the fighter can instead direct the damage to a weapon from the associated weapon group that he is wielding.

				<p>The fighter selects a number of combat feats that he knows equal to his weapon training bonus with the associated weapon group. The selected feats must be ones that require the fighter to choose a type of weapon (such as Weapon Focus and Weapon Specialization), and the fighter must have chosen weapons that belong to the associated fighter weapon group. The fighter is treated as having the selected feats for all the weapons in the associated weapon group that are legal choices for those feats. The fighter is also considered to have those feats with these weapons for the purpose of meeting prerequisites.</p>

The fighter need not be wearing armor or using a shield to use this option. When using adaptable training, the fighter substitutes his total base attack bonus (including his base attack bonus gained through levels in other classes) for his ranks in this skill, but adds the skill&#146;s usual ability score modifier and any other bonuses or penalties that would modify that skill. Once a skill has been selected, it cannot be changed and the fighter can immediately retrain all of his ranks in the selected skill at no additional cost in money or time. In addition, the fighter adds all skills chosen with this option to his list of class skills. A fighter can choose this option up to four times.</p>

While wearing the selected type of armor, the fighter adds one-quarter of his fighter level to the armor&#146;s armor bonus, up to a maximum bonus of +3 for light armor, +4 for medium armor, or +5 for heavy armor. This increase to the armor bonus doesn&#146;t increase the benefit that the fighter gains from feats, class abilities, or other effects that are determined by his armor&#146;s base armor bonus, including other advanced armor training options. A fighter can choose this option multiple times. Each time he chooses it, he applies its benefit to a different type of armor.</p>

				<p>The fighter can don armor in a hurry without reducing its effectiveness, and remove it quickly when it becomes a hindrance. When the fighter dons or removes his armor or dons it hastily, the amount of time needed to do so is reduced, as noted on the table below. Other characters can still help the fighter don his armor as normal.</p>
				<table>
					<tr>
						<td>Armor Type</td>
						<td>Don</td>

				<p>Additionally, when wearing hastily donned armor, the fighter can attempt a Strength or Dexterity check as a full-round action to remove the penalties associated with wearing hastily donned armor (DC = 10 + his armor&#146;s unmodified armor bonus). If he succeeds at the check, he is treated as having properly donned his armor rather than having hastily donned it.</p>
				<p>The fighter can also remove his armor in the same amount of time that it takes him to don his armor hastily. He can even remove sections of armor to escape grapples and similar grasping hindrances. Whenever the fighter attempts a combat maneuver check, an Escape Artist check, or a Strength check to escape from an effect that reduces or restricts his ability to move or act, he can reduce the armor bonus of any armor that he is wearing by up to half his armor&#146;s base armor bonus. If he does so, he gains a bonus on his check equal to the amount by which he reduced his armor&#146;s armor bonus. Multiple uses of this ability cannot reduce the armor&#146;s armor bonus below half its base armor bonus, and the reduction to the armor&#146;s armor bonus lasts until the fighter recovers and dons the removed pieces of armor.</p>

Treat this attack as a weapon attack made using the same special material (if any) as the armor. The armor&#146;s enhancement bonus does not modify the headbutt attack, but the helm can be enchanted as a separate weapon.</p>

When a ranged attack is made against the gunslinger, she can spend 1 grit point to move 5 feet as an immediate action; doing so grants the gunslinger a +2 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. This movement is not a 5-foot step, and provokes attacks of opportunity. Alternatively, the gunslinger can drop prone to gain a +4 bonus to AC against the triggering attack.

The damage dealt by the pistol-whip is of the bludgeoning type, and is determined by the size of the firearm. One-handed firearms deal 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if wielded by Small creatures) and two-handed firearms deal 1d10 points of damage (1d8 if wielded by Small creatures). Regardless of the gunslinger's size, the critical multiplier of this attack is 20/&#215;2.

				<p>At 3rd level, if the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she can perform all of the following utility shots. Each utility shot can be applied to any single attack with a firearm, but the gunslinger must declare the utility shot she is using before firing the shot.</p>
				<list>
					<li>Blast Lock: The gunslinger makes an attack roll against a lock within the first range increment of her firearm. A Diminutive lock usually has AC 7, and larger locks have a lower AC. The lock gains a bonus to its AC against this attack based on its quality. A simple lock has a +10 bonus to AC, an average lock has a +15 bonus to AC, a good lock has a +20 bonus to AC, and a superior lock has a +30 bonus to AC. Arcane lock grants a +10 bonus to the AC of a lock against this attack. On a hit, the lock is destroyed, and the object can be opened as if it were unlocked. On a miss, the lock is destroyed, but the object is jammed and still considered locked. It can still be unlocked by successfully performing this deed, by using the Disable Device skill, or with the break DC, though the DC for either break or Disable Device or the AC increases by 10. A key, combination, or similar mechanical method of unlocking the lock no longer works, though knock can still be employed to bypass the lock, and the creator of an arcane lock can still bypass the wards of that spell.</li>
					<li>Scoot Unattended Object: The gunslinger makes an attack roll against a Tiny or smaller unattended object within the first range increment of her firearm. A Tiny unattended object has an AC of 5, a Diminutive unattended object has an AC of 7, and a Fine unattended object has an AC of 11. On a hit, the gunslinger does not damage the object with the shot, but can move it up to 15 feet farther away from the shot's origin. On a miss, she damages the object normally.</li>
					<li>Stop Bleeding: The gunslinger makes a firearm attack and then presses the hot barrel against herself or an adjacent creature to staunch a bleeding wound. Instead of dealing damage, the shot ends a single bleed condition affecting the creature. The gunslinger does not have to make an attack roll when performing the deed in this way; she can instead shoot the firearm into the air, but that shot still uses up ammunition normally.</li>

			<name type="string">Dead Shot</name>
			<text type="formattedtext">
				<p>At 7th level, as a full-round action, the gunslinger can take careful aim and pool all of her attack potential into a single, deadly shot. When she does this, she shoots the firearm at a single target, but makes as many attack rolls as she can, based on her base attack bonus. She makes the attack rolls in order from highest bonus to lowest, as if she were making a full attack. If any of the attack rolls hit the target, the gunslinger's single attack is considered to have hit. For each additional successful attack roll beyond the first, the gunslinger increases the damage of the shot by the base damage dice of the firearm. For instance, if a 7th-level gunslinger firing a musket hits with both attacks, she does 2d12 points of damage with the shot, instead of 1d12 points of damage, before adding any damage modifiers. Precision damage and extra damage from weapon special abilities (such as flaming) are added with damage modifiers and are not increased by this deed. If one or more rolls are critical threats, she confirms the critical once using her highest base attack bonus &#150;5. For each critical threat beyond the first, she reduces this penalty by 1 (to a maximum of 0). The gunslinger only misfires on a dead shot if all the attack rolls are misfires. She cannot perform this deed with a blunderbuss or other scatter weapon when attacking creatures in a cone. The gunslinger must spend 1 grit point to perform this deed.</p>

This deed costs 1 grit point to perform no matter which part of the creature she targets. Creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are immune to these effects.</p>
				<list>
					<li>Arms: On a hit, the target takes no damage from the hit but drops one carried item of the gunslinger's choice, even if the item is wielded with two hands. Items held in a locked gauntlet are not dropped on a hit.</li>
					<li>Head: On a hit, the target is damaged normally, and is also confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect.</li>

				<p>At 1st level, when the pistolero hits a target with a one-handed firearm that is not making a scatter shot, she can spend 1 grit point to deal 1d6 points of extra damage on a hit.

				<p>When an investigator creates or prepares a poison, including poisons derived from racial or class abilities, he can spend one use of inspiration to create an anathema instead. Anathemas count as poisons, but they can affect creatures that are normally immune to poison, as they exploit vulnerabilities in their very nature rather than their biology. When an anathema is created, select a creature type (and subtype, if applicable) from the ranger favored enemy list; the anathema functions only against this chosen type. The investigator also chooses one of the following special abilities for the anathema to affect: damage reduction (except DR/&#151;), energy resistance (one type chosen by the investigator), fast healing, movement speed, or spell resistance.</p>
				<p>The method of delivery (contact, ingested, inhaled, or injury) and the DC of the anathema&#146;s save are identical to those of the poison used to make the anathema. If the target fails its save against the anathema (even if the enemy is normally immune to effects that require a specific save, such as undead&#146;s immunity to effects that require a Fortitude save), the value of the chosen ability is lowered by 5 (minimum 0) for 1 round per investigator level.</p>

This talent can be selected multiple times; each time, it grants the investigator a new rogue talent.</p>

				<p>Mercenaries in the employ of the Aspis Consortium often use wands of invisibility to attack protected targets, then blend into the crowd to escape or disguise the source of the next attack. An investigator with this ability is practiced at attacking from magical concealment.

				<p>Additionally, if the investigator becomes visible as a result of a weapon or spell attack, he can sheathe his weapon as a free action and instantly adopt a neutral posture. With a successful Bluff or Disguise check (opposed by witnesses&#146; Sense Motive or Perception checks, whichever is higher), there is no obvious sign that the investigator is the source of the attack (though a lack of any other reasonable candidate can still lead observers to draw the correct conclusion).</p>

				<p>Blast Type physical; Damage bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing</p>
				<p>You throw a nearby unattended object at a single foe as a ranged attack. The object must weigh no more than 5 pounds per kineticist level you possess. If the attack hits, the target and the thrown object each take the blast&#146;s damage. Since the object is enfolded in strands of aether, even if you use this power on a magic weapon or other unusual object, the attack doesn&#146;t use any of the magic weapon&#146;s bonuses or effects; it simply deals your blast damage. Alternatively, you can loosen the strands of aether in order to deal damage to both the object and the target as though you had thrown the object yourself (instead of dealing your normal blast damage). You substitute your Constitution modifier for your Strength modifier if throwing the object would have added your Strength modifier on the damage roll, and you don&#146;t take the &#150;4 penalty on the attack roll for throwing an object that wasn&#146;t designed to be thrown. In this case, the object&#146;s special effects apply (including effects from its materials), and if the object is a weapon, you must be proficient with it and able to wield it with one hand; otherwise, the item deals damage as a one-handed improvised weapon for a creature of your size.</p>

If an attack deals less damage than you still have as temporary hit points from force ward, it still reduces those temporary hit points but otherwise counts as a miss for the purpose of abilities that trigger on a hit or a miss.

				<p>Your kinetic blast ignites your foes. Whenever an infused blast hits a foe and penetrates its spell resistance, that foe catches on fire, regardless of whether it takes damage. A foe that catches fire takes 1d6 points of fire damage each round until the fire is extinguished. Against a creature on fire from this infusion, any fire kinetic blasts gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls, to DCs, and on caster level checks to overcome spell resistance.</p>

				<p>Your electric blast leaps from target to target. When you hit a target with your infused blast, you can attempt a ranged touch attack against an additional target that is within 30 feet of the first. Each additional attack originates from the previous target, which could alter cover and other conditions. Each additional target takes 1d6 fewer points of damage than the last (for example, 3d6 becomes 2d6), and you can&#146;t chain the blast back to a previous target. You can continue chaining your blasts until a blast misses or fails to deal damage, or until your blast is reduced to a single damage die.</p>

				<p>You can drain elemental energy and matter from your foes to strengthen your next attack. When you use this infusion, your kinetic blast affects only creatures with a subtype matching your kinetic blast&#146;s element (for instance, a fire blast would damage only creatures of the fire subtype). Against such creatures, your blast targets touch AC (if it requires an attack roll) and always allows spell resistance. Because you are draining energy from the target, your blast doesn&#146;t apply your elemental overflow bonuses or Constitution modifier. The target can attempt a Fortitude save to take 1/4 the normal amount of damage. Draining infusion ignores any damage reduction, resistances, and immunities the creature might possess. If at least one creature fails its saving throw against your draining infusion, you can reduce the total burn cost of any one blast wild talent used before the end of your next turn by 1, or by 2 if you have the supercharge ability. If you use draining infusion again before applying this reduction, you still deal the damage from that draining infusion, but the burn reductions don&#146;t stack.</p>

				<p>Instead of a single kinetic blast, you shoot two kinetic blasts at targets within 120 feet that each deal damage as if your kineticist level were 1st (effects or abilities that increase your kinetic blast&#146;s damage don&#146;t apply). At 10th level, you can shoot three blasts with flurry of blasts; this increases to four blasts at 16th level and to five blasts at 20th level. If you are under the effect of haste or similar magic that increases your number of attacks in a fullattack action, the number of kinetic blasts in your flurry of blasts increases by 1.</p>
				<p>No two targets can be more than 30 feet apart. You must assign the targets of all your blasts before rolling any of the attacks. Any blast beyond the first that hits the same target adds 1d6 points of damage; bonuses and penalties to damage don&#146;t apply. If you are using a substance infusion that requires a saving throw, a target attempts its save only once (even if it was hit multiple times), but it takes a penalty on the save equal to the number of times it was hit beyond the first. If you are using a substance infusion that requires a caster level check or combat maneuver check, you roll the check only once against each target, but you gain a bonus on the check equal to the number of times that target was hit beyond the first.

The kinetic blade&#146;s shape is purely cosmetic and doesn&#146;t affect the damage dice, critical threat range, or critical multiplier of the kinetic blade, nor does it grant the kinetic blade any weapon special features. The object held by a telekineticist for this form infusion doesn&#146;t prevent her from using gather power.</p>
				<p>You can use this form infusion once as part of an attack action, a charge action, or a full-attack action in order to make melee attacks with your kinetic blade. Since it&#146;s part of another action (and isn&#146;t an action itself), using this wild talent doesn&#146;t provoke any additional attacks of opportunity. The kinetic blade deals your kinetic blast damage on each hit (applying any modifiers to your kinetic blast&#146;s damage as normal, but not your Strength modifier). The blade disappears at the end of your turn. The weapon deals the same damage type that your kinetic blast deals, and it interacts with Armor Class and spell resistance as normal for a blast of its type. Even if a telekineticist uses this power on a magic weapon or another unusual object, the attack doesn&#146;t use any of the magic weapon&#146;s bonuses or effects and simply deals the telekineticist&#146;s blast damage. The kinetic blade doesn&#146;t add the damage bonus from elemental overflow.</p>

				<p>You surround your body with energy or elemental matter from your kinetic abilities. You can use this form infusion as part of an attack action, a charge action, or a full-attack action to add damage to each of your natural attacks and unarmed strikes until the beginning of your next turn.

You deal an additional 1d6 points of damage per 3 dice of your kinetic blast&#146;s damage (minimum 1d6), and this damage is of the same type as your kinetic blast&#146;s damage. This extra damage ignores spell resistance and doesn&#146;t apply any modifiers to your kinetic blast&#146;s damage, such as your Constitution modifier.</p>

Unlike most reach weapons, the kinetic whip can also attack nearby creatures. The kinetic whip disappears at the beginning of your next turn, but in the intervening time, it threatens all squares within its reach, allowing you to make attacks of opportunity that deal the whip&#146;s usual damage.</p>

				<p>You create a 20-foot-radius whirling maelstrom in a body of water within 120 feet (the area of the maelstrom does not include any squares in the radius that aren&#146;t in the water). Any creature in the maelstrom immediately takes one-quarter your blast&#146;s normal damage regardless of whether it succeeds at its save. A creature that succeeds at its Reflex save can choose to exit the area at the closest space. A creature in the maelstrom must succeed at a DC 35 Swim check in order to swim, and any creature that enters the maelstrom or ends its turn in the maelstrom takes half your blast&#146;s normal damage. As a free action at the beginning of your turn, you can position each creature in the maelstrom anywhere you choose within the affected area. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier or until you use this infusion again. You can use grappling infusion with this infusion.</p>

				<p>You send an elemental mass, energy ball, or object into a particular square within 30 feet, dealing 1/4 the normal amount of damage (or half the normal amount of damage, for an energy blast) to all creatures in that square. The mobile blast lasts until you dismiss it as a free action, lose consciousness, or move farther than 30 feet from it. Each round on your turn as a move action, you can move the mobile blast to another square within range; either way, it continues to deal damage to all creatures in its final square each round if they fail their saving throws. You can have only a single mobile blast in existence at a time. If the mobile blast&#146;s total burn cost before applying any reduction for gather power is 0, it has no maximum duration. Otherwise, it lasts for a maximum number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier, and afterward you can&#146;t create another mobile blast for a number of minutes equal to the number of rounds it existed. A mobile blast is always extremely loud and visible. The saving throw DC is Dexterity-based.</p>

				<p>Your kinetic blast burns so hot that it melts away your foe&#146;s magical effects. Whenever your infused blast hits a foe and penetrates its spell resistance, you can attempt a caster level check as if using a targeted dispel magic before determining whether the foe takes damage from the blast. You can choose to reduce the blast&#146;s damage by half to increase your bonus on the caster level check by 2. If you don&#146;t choose a specific spell effect to attempt to dispel, you automatically attempt to dispel effects that would protect the target from fire damage before other spells.</p>

If she fails a check, she must start over, and after each failure she must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or develop a deformity from the mutant template (Bestiary 5 180). At the end of the ninth day, she emerges reborn, with the earth child wild talent in place of one of her 3rd-level or lower utility talents. A geokineticist can halt this attunement at any point without incurring negative effects.</p>

				<p>You reach out to a creature with which you are familiar by using a conduit through an elemental plane. By concentrating for 10 minutes, you create one end of the conduit in a manifestation of your chosen element, such as a fire, pool of water, or section of earth, which must be at least 2 feet in diameter. If the creature you are attempting to contact is within earshot of a similar elemental manifestation and on the same plane, the conduit forms successfully, allowing both sides to see a likeness of the other. You can hear and talk to each other, though you cannot perceive anything else from the other side of the connection. If the creature is not within earshot of a similar elemental manifestation, you can maintain your concentration to wait until the creature comes close enough to such a feature. The connection lasts until you stop concentrating on it, use this ability again, or until the creature moves away from the conduit.</p>

Any creature other than you who opens the container takes damage as from your fire blast (or blue flame blast, if you have it). The damage affects the creature automatically if it is touching the container, but if it opens the container from within 30 feet, it can attempt a Reflex save to negate the damage, and if it opens the container from farther still, it takes no damage. Whether or not the creature that opened the container takes damage, your kinetic blast damage also affects any items within the container that you choose, as well as the container, if you wish it, and leaves all other items undamaged. This counts as a magical trap with a Perception and Disable Device DC equal to 10 + your kineticist level + your Dexterity modifier. You can accept 1 point of burn when using flame trap to make a new trap without dismissing any previous traps. If you do, the trap lasts until the next time you recover burn.</p>

				<p>An aerokineticist must fly around the entire perimeter of the Eye of Abendego without stopping, while succeeding at a series of 12 consecutive DC 40 Fly checks. If successful, she can learn the hurricane queen wild talent. If she fails two or fewer checks, she takes 50d6 points of bludgeoning damage from the hurricane&#146;s galeforce winds. If she fails three or more checks, she must succeed at a DC 25 Reflex save or be pulled into the Eye of Abendego, never to return.</p>

				<p>Prerequisite kinetic cover</p>
				<p>You create a 5-foot-by-5-foot pillar of ice, packed dirt, or tangled roots with a height of up to 15 feet. This takes 1 full round, during which time the ground within the affected area rumbles conspicuously, but it rises only at the end of the round. You can&#146;t create a pillar in an area occupied by or adjacent to any creatures unless all such creatures are willing, and if an unwilling creature moves into the area before the pillar finishes rising, it can disrupt and foil the pillar. As the pillar springs into existence, willing creatures and objects within the affected area are lifted with it.</p>
				<p>The pillar can&#146;t be used to crush creatures or objects against the ceiling; if insufficient room is available for the pillar and any creatures or objects on it, the pillar reaches only the maximum possible height. You can&#146;t create a pillar under a Large or larger creature.</p>
				<p>The pillar has AC 4, hardness 0, and 3 hit points per kineticist level. Scaling the pillar&#146;s rough edges requires a successful DC 15 Climb check. When destroyed, when you create a new pillar, or when a number of rounds equal to your Constitution bonus (minimum 1) have elapsed, the pillar crumbles, melts, or withers away, gently lowering anything on it back to the ground.</p>

You can use this ability even when affected by an effect that denies you actions, so long as this effect is one that break enchantment could remove.

				<p>You attach a sticky strand of invisible aether to a target and then project your senses along the strand, allowing you to spy on that target. Attaching the strand of aether requires a ranged touch attack, but if you activate this ability while your target is under the effect of your touchsight, you can use the strands from your touchsight instead. Once you have activated spying touchsight, you can concentrate on it to spy on your target with any of your five senses (though your own body no longer benefits from the senses you project); the strand lasts as long you concentrate, though you can switch which senses you are projecting each round. A creature using see invisibility or a similar effect can notice the trailing strand of aether and follow it back to you. A creature can break your spying touchsight by dispelling it, but otherwise, the only way to break the strand is if one of you uses a teleportation effect, moves more than 1 mile from the other, or is completely blocked from the other in all directions (such as if one of you were inside a telekinetic sphere).</p>

				<p>Prerequisite watersense</p>
				<p>You project your watersense outward through the tides and water around you, allowing you to spy on others at a distance. You can take 10 minutes to project your senses, choosing a location within 480 feet that is connected to your current location via the same continuous body of water, or you can take 1 hour to attempt to spy on a specific creature within 1 mile per kineticist level that is visible from a location connected to your current location via the same continuous body of water. In the latter case, the creature receives a Will save as per scrying (including bonuses and penalties based on connection and knowledge); a target that saves is immune to your greater watersense for 24 hours. In either case, an extremely thin funnel of water, lasting for 1 minute per kineticist level, carries light and sound to your location, where your target area or location appears in the water next to you and you can view it as if through a scrying sensor, allowing you to both see and hear the area immediately surrounding the other end of the funnel. In the case of a distance greater than 480 feet, the sound comes 1 round later than its corresponding visual information for every mile away you are (for instance, if you were 5 miles away, you would see your target start talking 5 rounds before you heard what it said). When you are tracking a creature, the funnel moves as best it can through the water to follow that creature, up to 150 feet per round, but the target can escape by simply moving away from the water. If you also possess the voice of the wind wild talent, you can use its message effect to send your voice through the funnel with a delay of 1 round per mile. This wild talent is a divination and scrying effect.</p>

This allows you to use your windsight wild talent to catch a quick glimpse and hear a tiny snippet from any location that could be reached by the wind traveling that distance (the wind&#146;s path can&#146;t pass through openings smaller than 1 inch in diameter). The breeze travels 100 feet per round, so what you see and hear is delayed by 1 round for every 50 feet of the path. If you spend at least 10 minutes to set up a steady flow of wind, you can concentrate for up to 1 minute per level to gain continuous visual and auditory information for as long as you concentrate, delayed by 1 round for every 100 feet the wind travels (since the steady flow of wind has to travel only one way). While there is no invisible sensor to detect with this ability, creatures along the path of the breeze may notice a light wind, though it may not seem out of the ordinary.</p>

If the natural attack is made with an appendage that would normally hold a weapon (such as a claw attack), the magus cannot wield a weapon in that appendage while making natural attacks with it. If the natural attack is a bite or other attack that does not require a free appendage to make, the magus can use the natural attack in addition to all of the attacks he could make with his melee weapon, if he has one. A magus can select this arcana more than once. The bonus on concentration checks does not stack. Each time he selects this arcana, he selects another natural weapon. For example, a magus could select this arcana twice, choosing claw attacks and bite attacks. This would allow him to use a full-round action to make all of his claw attacks with his free hand and all of his bite attacks in addition to casting a spell. This arcana otherwise functions exactly like the spell combat class feature.</p>

As a free action while making an attack roll with the infused ranged weapon, after the attack roll has been made but before the results are revealed by the GM, the magus can release the charge and cause his attack to deal 1d6 points of energy damage (acid, cold, electricity, or fire, chosen when he spends the arcane pool point to activate this ability).

				<p>This functions like the reflection magus arcana, except it only works on spells that deal acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage. As long as the elemental knight spends at least 1 point from her arcane pool to activate this arcana, he may expend rounds of elemental assault as if they were arcane pool points. For example, the knight could spend 1 arcane pool point and 3 rounds of elemental assault to reflect a spell of 4th-level or lower. The elemental knight must be at least 12th level before selecting this arcana.</p>

				<p>An archmage spirit is a font of knowledge and arcane power.</p>
				<p><b>Spirit Bonus: </b>When you channel an archmage, your spirit bonus applies on concentration checks, Intelligence checks, and Intelligence-based skill checks.</p>
				<p><b>Seance Boon: </b>Your damaging spells deal an additional 2 points of damage of the same type that they would normally deal to each target.</p>
				<p><b>Favored Locations: </b>Arcane redoubts, areas of unusual magic, libraries, schools.</p>
				<p><b>Influence Penalty: </b>Your body begins to respond as if you were a frail, aged scholar. You take a penalty equal to your spirit bonus on Strength checks, Strength-based skill checks, Constitution checks, attack rolls, and non-spell damage rolls.</p>
				<p><b>Taboos: </b>Choose one: You eschew all faith in the divine, so you must not be the willing target of divine spells or abilities and you must attempt a Will saving throw against even harmless divine spells and abilities; you must not pass up the opportunity to learn something new and significant (a nontrivial piece of information with a Knowledge check of DC 20 or higher) when that opportunity is directly present; you must use your own magical solution to a challenge if you can, even if a mundane solution that would require fewer resources is available.</p>
				<p><b>Archmage Arcana (Lesser, Su): </b>Instead of your normal spells per day for your medium level, you use the spells per day from Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist. For each level of spell you can now cast (including level 0), each time you channel an archmage spirit, select a single spell of that level from the sorcerer/wizard spell list to add to your medium spell list and spells known until you lose contact with the archmage. When you cast these spells, they count as arcane (though not for the purpose of fulfilling prerequisites), and thus you must provide verbal and somatic components instead of thought and emotion components (see page 144).</p>
				<p><b>Arcane Surge (Intermediate, Su): </b>You can allow the archmage spirit to gain 1 point of inf luence over you in order to cast one of your medium spells known without expending a spell slot. When you do so, the caster level and DC of the spell increase by 1, and you can&#146;t apply metamagic to the spell.</p>
				<p><b>Wild Arcana (Greater, Su): </b>You can allow the archmage spirit to gain 1 point of influence over you in order to cast any sorcerer/wizard spell of a level you can cast. You must expend a spell slot of the appropriate level, and you can&#146;t apply metamagic to the spell.</p>
				<p><b>Legendary Archmage (Supreme, Su): </b>Once per day, you can cast any spell on the sorcerer/wizard spell list as if using the wild arcana ability, except the archmage doesn&#146;t gain 1 point of influence over you, the spell doesn&#146;t require a spell slot, and you can select a spell of any level.</p>

				<p>A champion spirit is a paragon of skill at arms.</p>
				<p><b>Spirit Bonus: </b>When you channel a champion, your spirit bonus applies on attack rolls, non-spell damage rolls, Strength checks, Strength-based skill checks, and Fortitude saves.</p>
				<p><b>Seance Boon: </b>You gain a +2 bonus on all non-spell damage rolls.</p>
				<p><b>Favored Locations: </b>Arenas, battlefields, places of violence, practice yards.</p>
				<p><b>Influence Penalty: </b>You are quick to violence and prefer a weapon to spells or contemplation. You take a penalty equal to your spirit bonus on Intelligence checks and Intelligence-based skill checks, and to your caster level (to a minimum of caster level 0); as usual, a reduced caster level may render you unable to cast spells. You can&#146;t benefit from effects that increase your caster level.</p>
				<p><b>Taboos: </b>Choose one: you are superstitious about arcane spellcasting, so you must not be the willing target of arcane spells or abilities and you must attempt a Will saving throw against even harmless arcane spells and abilities; you may not make an attack with any weapon except a specific manufactured weapon (such as &#147;my father&#146;s +2 falchion&#148;) that you choose when you take the taboo, and you may not choose unarmed strike for this taboo; you must accept any challenge to prove your prowess in battle, including challenges to single combat&#151;if you or an ally breaks the rules of the challenge, you break this taboo.</p>
				<p><b>Champion's Prowess (Lesser, Su): </b>You gain proficiency in all martial weapons and in one exotic weapon of your choice, which you choose each time you channel a champion spirit.</p>
				<p><b>Sudden Attack (Intermediate, Su): </b>Whenever you take a full-attack action, you gain one additional attack at your highest base attack bonus. This ability stacks with the extra attack from haste, but it doesn&#146;t stack with special actions that grant extra attacks, such as flurry of blows or spell combat. Sudden attack works as normal with full-attack options such as two-weapon fighting.</p>
				<p><b>Fleet Charge (Greater, Su): </b>You can take a swift action and a full-round action to move up to your speed and then make a full attack. This special action doesn&#146;t combine with sudden attack, but works as normal with effects such as haste and two-weapon fighting. As soon as you begin moving, you are considered to have begun the full-round action, even if circumstances prevent you from attacking at the end of your movement.</p>
				<p><b>Legendary Champion (Supreme, Su): </b>You gain two combat feats of your choice, and you can choose different feats each time you channel a champion spirit. You can treat your base attack bonus from your medium levels as equal to your medium level for the purposes of qualifying for combat feats and determining their effects, and you can count your medium levels as levels of one other class whose base attack bonus equals its class level (such as fighter, barbarian, or slayer) for the purpose of qualifying for the two new combat feats.</p>

				<p><b>Seance Boon: </b>You gain a +1 bonus to CMD.</p>
				<p><b>Favored Locations: </b>City walls, forts, gates, keeps.</p>
				<p><b>Influence Penalty: </b>You are incredibly cautious and guarded in all things, and your caution sometimes gets in the way. When attacking, you always fight defensively, and when casting a spell, you always cast defensively. Because of your focus on defense, you take a penalty on damage rolls equal to your spirit bonus.</p>
				<p><b>Taboos: </b>Choose one: you must always protect others from danger when you can (including defeated enemies, but not enemies that are an active threat to you and others); you must keep your body in fit physical condition, and you break this taboo every time you drop below half your maximum hit points; you must speak no words and use no abilities with the sonic descriptor, and you break this taboo if you become enraged, frightened, or panicked.</p>
				<p><b>Guardian's Shield (Lesser, Su): </b>You gain proficiency in heavy armors and shields (including tower shields).</p>
				<p><b>Absorb Blow (Intermediate, Su): </b>You gain DR/&#151; and resistance to acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic equal to 1/2 your medium level. Add paladin&#146;s sacrificeAPG to your medium spells known as a 2nd-level spell.</p>
				<p><b>Sudden Block (Greater, Su): </b>After an enemy&#146;s attack would hit you or an adjacent creature, you can use spirit surge to increase the victim&#146;s AC, possibly causing the attack to fail, by rolling your spirit surge die and adding it to the chosen character&#146;s AC. You must not be flat-footed, and you must be aware of the attack. If use of this ability causes the enemy&#146;s attack to miss, you can make an attack at your highest base attack bonus against that enemy as an immediate action.</p>
				<p><b>Legendary Guardian (Supreme, Su): </b>Once per day as an immediate action, you can ignore the effects of a single attack against you, including enemy spells targeting you or whose area or effect includes you. The attack affects other creatures as normal.</p>

				<p><b>Spirit Bonus: </b>When you channel a hierophant, your spirit bonus applies on Wisdom checks, Wisdom-based skill checks, and Will saves.</p>
				<p><b>Seance Boon: </b>Your healing spells and abilities heal an additional 2 points of damage to each target. This does not affect healing conferred by magic items, nor does it add to fast healing or similar effects.</p>
				<p><b>Favored Locations: </b>Altars, churches, sacred groves, shrines.</p>
				<p><b>Influence Penalty: </b>Whether the spirit hopes to offer a chance for redemption or to sacrifice foes later on a dark altar, you must strike for nonlethal damage in combat whenever possible. You take a penalty equal to your spirit bonus on all Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks involving worshipers of faiths other than the spirit&#146;s, except checks to convince others to convert to the spirit&#146;s faith.</p>
				<p><b>Taboos: </b>Choose one: you must strongly revere nature and may not wear metal armor or shields; you must follow a paladin or antipaladin code as appropriate for the spirit&#146;s deity; you may not deliberately speak any lies, including bluffing, exaggerating, stating half-truths with intent to deceive, lies by omission, and so on, and if you know the answer to a question that someone asks you, you must give the answer.</p>
				<p><b>Divine Surge (Lesser, Su): </b>This power functions as the archmage arcana spirit power, except that you add spells from the cleric/oracle list instead of the sorcerer/wizard list (these spells count as divine), and you need a divine focus if the spell requires one.</p>
				<p><b>Energy Font (Intermediate, Su): </b>You can channel energy a number of times per day equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. Choose whether you channel positive or negative energy each time you contact a hierophant spirit; this choice must match the spirit&#146;s faith. If you choose positive energy, add cure spells of each level you can cast from the cleric list to your medium spell list and spells known. Otherwise, add inflict spells in the same way. These spells count as divine, as in the divine surge spirit power.</p>
				<p><b>Overflowing Grace (Greater, Su): </b>When you heal a creature to full hit points or a creature already at full hit points with your positive or negative energy, that creature gains a +1 sacred bonus on attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, and saving throws for 1 round. The bonus is sacred if you use positive energy and profane if you use negative energy. If you destroy or kill one or more creatures with positive or negative energy, you gain a +1 bonus of the same type on attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, and saving throws for 1 round.</p>
				<p><b>Legendary Hierophant (Supreme, Su) </b>: Once per day, you can request a minor miracle. This request must be in line with the options for miracle that don&#146;t cost powdered diamond. As usual for a miracle, the deity or other being the spirit worships can choose whether or not to grant the request at its whim.</p>

				<p>A marshal spirit is a towering presence and an inspiration to others.</p>
				<p><b>Spirit Bonus: </b>When you channel a marshal, your spirit bonus applies on Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks, as well as on spirit surge rolls. This allows the bonus to apply twice to the total result if you use a spirit surge on a Charisma check or on a Charisma-based skill check.</p>
				<p><b>Seance Boon: </b>Choose a seance boon from any of the other legends to benefit from. When using the shared seance class feature, each participant can choose a different boon.</p>
				<p><b>Favored Locations: </b>Council rooms, stages, theaters, throne rooms.</p>
				<p><b>Influence Penalty: </b>The time you spend concentrating on your allies prevents you from attending to other important matters. You take a penalty equal to your spirit bonus on Wisdom checks and Wisdom-based skill checks. Additionally, if you are not at least nominally in charge of your present allies, you lose the marshal&#146;s spirit bonus and seance boon.</p>
				<p><b>Taboos: </b>Choose one: you may not allow yourself or your allies to prevent a fleeing enemy from escaping, since an at-large villain makes a better tale (this applies only to enemies seeking to escape, not to those retreating to alert others or fight again from a better position); you may never leave an ally behind or allow yourself or your allies to sacrifice another ally, even a summoned creature; you must embrace any opportunity to spread the legend of yourself and your allies, even when a low profile would be helpful.</p>
				<p><b>Marshal's Order (Lesser, Su): </b>You can use your spirit surge on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, concentration checks, and skill checks rolled by you or any allies who participated in your seance as long as you have line of sight and line of effect, and are within 30 feet of the chosen ally. You can still use spirit surge only once per round.</p>
				<p><b>Inspiring Call (Intermediate, Su): </b>As a standard action, you can grant all allies who can see and hear you a competence bonus equal to your spirit bonus on either saving throws or attack and damage rolls. You choose which bonus to grant each time you use inspiring call. This ability lasts for 1 round. If you have the decisive strike greater spirit power, you can use inspiring call as a move action. If you have the legendary marshal supreme spirit power, you can use inspiring call as a swift action.</p>
				<p><b>Decisive Strike (Greater, Su): </b>You can allow the marshal to gain 1 point of influence over you as a swift action to allow an ally within 30 feet who can see and hear you to make a single melee or ranged attack during your turn. You can use this ability as a standard action to instead allow the ally to perform any standard action.</p>
				<p><b>Legendary Marshal (Supreme, Su): </b>You can use a lesser spirit surge without incurring inf luence. This lesser surge adds a maximum of 1d6 to the roll and does not apply your spirit bonus, regardless of other effects or abilities you have that alter your spirit surge. A lesser surge still counts as a spirit surge for the purpose of the limit of one spirit surge per round, but it does not consume any free uses of spirit surge you may have from effects such as taboo.</p>

				<p>A trickster spirit is a savvy and manipulative master of skills.</p>
				<p><b>Spirit Bonus: </b>When you channel a trickster, your spirit bonus applies on Dexterity checks, skill checks, and Reflex saves.</p>
				<p><b>Seance Boon: </b>Choose one skill when you gain this seance boon. You gain a +1 bonus on skill checks using that skill, and that skill counts as a class skill for you.</p>
				<p><b>Favored Locations: </b>Alleys, mazes, taverns, trap-filled locations.</p>
				<p><b>Influence Penalty: </b>The trickster within you is a protean manipulator, and you begin to see the possibility that everyone around you might have ulterior motives as well. You never count as an ally for the purpose of gaining benefits from another creature&#146;s abilities, nor do you count as a willing target for spells. Anyone attempting to target you with a touch range spell, even a beneficial spell, must succeed at a melee touch attack, though you need not attempt saving throws against harmless spells. You gain no benefit from another creature&#146;s aid another attempts, as you are too busy making sure they aren&#146;t secretly tricking or sabotaging you.</p>
				<p><b>Taboos: </b>Choose one: you can&#146;t abide revealing your true identity, and you break this taboo when anyone pierces your disguise, even your own allies; you can never tell the truth; you can never pass up a more lucrative offer, even if it causes you to switch sides.</p>
				<p><b>Trickster's Edge (Lesser, Su): </b>Choose any two skills. These skills count as class skills for you, and you are treated as if you had an additional number of ranks in those skills equal to your medium level (to a maximum of your character level).</p>
				<p><b>Surprise Strike (Intermediate, Su): </b>When you attack an opponent that&#146;s denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, you deal 1d6 points of extra precision damage for every 3 medium levels. Your target counts as flat-footed against the first attack you make against that target in a day, regardless of abilities like uncanny dodge. After your first attack, that target is immune to being made flat-footed by your surprise strike for 24 hours.</p>
				<p><b>Transfer Magic (Greater, Su): </b>You can allow the trickster to gain 1 point of influence over you to make a melee touch attack against another creature as a standard action. If the attack succeeds, you randomly steal one of the harmless spells of the highest spell level active on that creature, ending the effect for the original creature and gaining all remaining duration for yourself. This ability does not work on personal-range or instantaneous- or permanent-duration spells.</p>
				<p><b>Legendary Trickster (Supreme, Su): </b>Once per day, instead of rolling for a skill check, you can choose your d20 result. Additionally, you gain the ability to change form at will as if using greater polymorph, except that you can mimic the form of a specific individual.</p>

Once there, you must vow to never break a binding contract, and must make a case for why you should be entrusted with power over others. Doing so requires a Wisdom check; if you succeed, Thrune answers your call.</p>
				<p><b>Taboos: </b>If you accept a taboo while channeling Thrune, you must vow to fight against chaos wherever you see it.</p>
				<p><b>Dynamic Decree (Lesser, Su): </b>Thrune always grants the following spells of each level: 0&#151;bleed, 1st&#151;bane, 2nd&#151;enthrall, 3rd&#151;agonize (Ultimate Magic 205), 4th&#151;greater infernal healing (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide 295), 5th&#151;true seeing, 6th&#151;banishment. This ability alters divine surge.</p>
				<p><b>Supernatural Aid (Greater, Su): </b>Once per day, you can call an outsider with a number of Hit Dice equal to or less than yours (maximum 18 HD) as if casting the appropriate planar ally spell. You do not need to pay the material component required to cast the spell, but you still must bargain with and pay the outsider for its services. This ability replaces overflowing grace.</p>

				<p><b>Gaining Favor: </b>To gain Ardril&#146;s favor, you must defeat an enemy with the dragon type and at least 7 Hit Dice without any aid from allies. After defeating the enemy, you must attempt a Wisdom check as you are bombarded with the memory of a linnorm&#146;s curse. If you succeed, Ardril answers your call.</p>
				<p><b>Taboos: </b>If you accept a taboo while channeling Ardril, you must never seek out or accept any position of power or leadership.</p>
				<p><b>Challenge (Lesser, Su): </b>You gain the challenge ability as a cavalier of your level. When you challenge a foe, your attacks ignore any damage reduction your target has. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on saving throws until the challenge ends.</p>
				<p><b>Death Curse (Supreme, Su): </b>When you channel Ardril, you can select any two linnorm death curse rage powers. You can select different rage powers each time you channel Ardril. Treat your medium level as your barbarian level for the purpose of meeting prerequisites. You gain the benefit of these rage powers against challenged foes even if you are not raging. For each additional point of damage that would be dealt by a rage power, you deal 1d6 points of damage instead.</p>

To gain his favor, you must travel to the Daggermark Poisoners&#146; Guild, or to the headquarters of any poisoners&#146; guild, herbalists&#146; guild, or similar organization. Once there, you must vow to use poison to eliminate foes significantly stronger than yourself, and stealthily place a poison you created on a guild member&#146;s person (without harming that person) or among the person&#146;s belongings, which requires a Dexterity check.

				<p><b>Gaining Favor: </b>To gain Arnisant&#146;s favor, you must travel either to the Crusader War College in Vigil, where the Shattered Shield of Arnisant is enshrined, or to the site of any major Shining Crusade battle. Once there, you must swear an oath to slay any undead you meet and concoct a tincture from the remains of a corporeal undead you have killed.

When you would be slain, turned to stone, or otherwise incapacitated, you can allow Arnisant&#146;s spirit to sacrifice himself to protect you from the effect. This negates any single non-damaging effect, and for a damaging effect, it leaves you with 0 hit points or your hit point total just before the deathblow, whichever is lower. In exchange, you lose contact with Arnisant and have no spirit abilities until your next day&#146;s seance. Furthermore, you can&#146;t contact Arnisant for 24 hours, and when you next contact Arnisant, he starts with 1 more point of influence over you than normal. This ability replaces absorb blow.</p>

			<text type="formattedtext">
				<p>History has a divided memory when it comes to Grand Prince Beldam I. Scholars of the schism that took place between Taldor and its erstwhile territories paint a picture of a diplomatic emperor whose insightful approach resulted in a largely bloodless transition from a monolithic empire to a collection of neighboring nations. Yet those who relate the tales for which the emperor is best known recall a quirky prankster with little regard for ceremony, tradition, or propriety. A rare few see the way in which these two personas combined to form exactly the leader Taldor needed at this fraught point in its history: someone who could offset the difficulty of a painful decision with frivolous antics. It is this balance of effectiveness through trickery that those channeling the spirit of Beldam seek to emulate.</p>
				<p><b>Gaining Favor: </b>Beldam answers the call of only those who share his esoteric sense of humor. You must convince someone to place a non-sentient animal in a position of authority, so long as such an act would not cause civil unrest or instability. You must then swear a vow to never act without due consideration of the consequences of your actions and attempt a Charisma check. If you succeed, Beldam answers your call.</p>
				<p><b>Taboos: </b>If you accept a taboo while channeling Beldam, you must embrace every opportunity to pull a prank or make a jest, but never at your own expense.</p>
				<p><b>Princely Humor (Lesser, Su): </b>You gain Improved Dirty Trick and Improved Feint as bonus feats. When you successfully perform a dirty trick, you can allow Beldam&#146;s spirit to gain 1 point of influence over you to target that opponent with hideous laughter (DC = 10 + 1/2 your medium level + your Charisma modifier) as a free action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity, in addition to the effects of the dirty trick.</p>
				<p><b>Atrocious Gift (Greater, Su): </b>You can allow Beldam to gain 1 point of influence over you to make a melee touch attack against another creature as a standard action. If you hit, you can transfer one disease or poison from yourself to the touched creature. You are immediately cured of the disease or poison and the target must attempt a saving throw against the transferred affliction (at the affliction&#146;s save DC) or suffer its effect or initial effect immediately. The target then continues to suffer from the affliction&#146;s normal effects thereafter.</p>

				<p><b>Gaining Favor: </b>To gain the Butcher&#146;s favor, you must deal a total number of hit points of bleed damage equal to twice your medium level to two dozen non-mindless living creatures, inflicting as much pain and suffering as possible. You must next vow to never use the Heal skill or magical healing to heal or treat another creature, then succeed at a Strength check.</p>
				<p><b>Favored Locations: </b>Abattoirs, battlefields, execution sites.</p>
				<p><b>Taboos: </b>If you accept a taboo while channeling the Butcher, you must not attack with bludgeoning weapons in combat and must never deal nonlethal damage. You must also kill all your defeated foes in combat, although you can accept surrender or take prisoners for the purpose of torturing and then killing those prisoners later (but before the Butcher departs).</p>
				<p><b>Bladesharp (Lesser, Ex): </b>You gain proficiency in all slashing martial weapons and the spiked chain. Any slashing weapon or spiked chain you wield gains the deadly weapon special quality (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 22) and on a critical hit deals an amount of bleed damage equal to the weapon&#146;s critical multiplier &#150; 1.</p>
				<p><b>Bloodletter (Intermediate, Ex): </b>The Butcher enhances a single slashing weapon or spiked chain, allowing you to add the keen, mighty cleaving, or wounding special abilities to the weapon when you wield it. As a swift action, you can allow the Butcher to gain 1 point of influence over you to make that weapon vorpal until the end of your turn, though the vorpal special ability doesn&#146;t work with abilities that let you choose the result of your d20 roll. Each time you kill a creature whose CR is greater than your medium level with this vorpal special ability, the butcher gains an additional point of influence over you.</p>

			<name type="string">Cyricas (Hierophant)</name>
			<text type="formattedtext">
				<p>Cyricas the Leaping Lion is a favorite hero among Taldan youth, due to both his miraculous recovery from a childhood ailment and his wild adventures with his ape companion Mardu. Most tales of Cyricas carry some lesson, whether encouraging kindness to animals or bravery in the face of adversity. Many Taldans grow to regard the adventures of Cyricas and Mardu as childish, but learn to respect his inspiring and widely circulated lectures. Those who seek rapport with this legendary spirit find that the bond between juvenile thrill-seeker and learned scholar is perhaps the strongest aspect of Cyricas&#146;s identity, superseded perhaps only by an unusual affinity for the number eight.</p>
				<p><b>Gaining Favor: </b>To gain the Leaping Lion&#146;s favor, you must release an animal that has been unjustly restrained. You must then swear an oath to never stand idle while an animal is being abused and attempt a Wisdom check. If you succeed, Cyricas answers your call.</p>
				<p><b>Seance Boon: </b>Your bonus on attack rolls when flanking an opponent increases by 2 (normally, to +4).</p>
				<p><b>Taboos: </b>If you accept a taboo while channeling Cyricas, you must vow to never harm an animal.</p>
				<p><b>Natural Magic (Lesser, Su): </b>You can draw upon the power of nature itself. This functions as the archmage arcana spirit power, except that you select spells from the druid list instead of the sorcerer/wizard list (these spells count as divine), and you must present a sprig of holly or another sacred plant to cast spells that require a divine focus.</p>
				<p><b>Princely Allies (Intermediate, Su): </b>Add the appropriate summon nature&#146;s ally spell for each spell level you can cast to your medium spell list. As long as you have exactly 1 creature summoned, it gains the benefits of the Augment Summoning feat, even if you don&#146;t have that feat.</p>
				<p><b>Breaking Chains (Greater, Su): </b>As a swift action, you can allow Cyricas to gain 1 point of influence over you to grant the benefits of freedom of movement to you and all allies within 60 feet for 1 minute.</p>

			<name type="string">Daronlyr XII (Archmage)</name>
			<text type="formattedtext">
				<p>While most of the legendary spirits of Taldor gained their fame through noble deeds, Daronlyr the Overthrower came to infamy through bold ambition. No one alive today&#151;and likely no one other than Daronlyr himself&#151;knows how much of his arcane might he leveraged in overthrowing his predecessor, but his ability to circumvent even the Ulfen Guard in claiming the throne left few doubting his abilities or his ruthlessness. Students of the arcane seek to trace their heritage to Daronlyr in the hope of capturing some of the Overthrower&#146;s prestige, but it is usually particularly ambitious students of the occult who find themselves calling upon the legendary spirit&#146;s power.</p>
				<p><b>Gaining Favor: </b>The Overthrower respects only those who are willing to reach out and claim power. You must use magic to gain control over the leader of a group of 50 or more individuals. Following this accomplishment, you must vow that you will never pass up an opportunity to gain further power for yourself, no matter the cost. This requires an Intelligence check. If you succeed, Daronlyr answers your call.</p>
				<p><b>Taboos: </b>If you accept a taboo while channeling Daronlyr, you must acknowledge no authority above your own and reject orders or directives from others.</p>
				<p><b>Assume the Role (Intermediate, Su): </b>You can allow Daronlyr to gain 1 point of influence over you in order to swap your position with that of a willing ally within 60 feet as a swift action. This is a conjuration [teleportation] effect. The next medium spell you cast within 1 round after making this swap doesn&#146;t expend a spell slot and doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
				<p><b>Usurp (Supreme, Su): </b>Once per day, when a creature fails a Will save against one of your spell effects, you can forfeit the spell&#146;s normal effects to instead affect the target creature as if you had cast greater possession.</p>

				<p><b>Gaining Favor: </b>To gain the Deceiver&#146;s favor, you must successfully lie to 100 different sentient creatures, convincing each one of a different lie that somehow leads to its death or other great misfortune. You must then vow to never make a truthful statement, except to answer a question whose answer is clearly already known to the asker (such as the color of the sky), and succeed at a Charisma check.</p>
				<p><b>Spirit Bonus: </b>When you channel the Deceiver, your spirit bonus applies to Charisma checks, Charisma-based skill checks, and Will saves against compulsions and divinations.</p>
				<p><b>Favored Locations: </b>Bordellos, courtrooms, gambling dens, taverns.</p>
				<p><b>Skilled Deceiver (Lesser, Ex): </b>You add 1/2 your medium level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Bluff checks.</p>
				<p><b>Shift Blame (Greater, Ex): </b>When you provoke an attack of opportunity from a given enemy, you can divert that attack of opportunity to another target of your choice within the attacker&#146;s reach. Afterward, the foe whose attack you diverted becomes immune to this ability for 24 hours. When you target a creature with a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability, or when you fail a Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check, you can allow the Deceiver to gain 1 point of influence over you to make the target believe another creature adjacent to you created the effect or attempted to lie to, convince, or bully the target.</p>

				<p><b>Gaining Favor: </b>To gain the Father of Legends&#146; favor, you must first compose a song or poem about a heroic event that you witnessed but did not take part in. Then you must perform the piece in front of a crowd of at least 100 people. If you succeed at a Charisma check during the performance, the Father of Legends will answer your call.</p>
				<p><b>Taboos: </b>If you accept a taboo while channeling the Father of Legends, you cannot take any actions that would deny an ally an opportunity for glory. This includes killing an enemy that an ally was attempting to defeat or forcibly removing an ally from combat, even when her life is in danger.</p>
				<p><b>Song of Valor (Intermediate, Su): </b>As a standard action, you can begin a performance that fills allies with power and confidence. Any ally that participated in your seance who can hear your performance receives a morale bonus to Strength and Constitution equal to your spirit bonus. You can maintain this performance for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier plus your spirit bonus. These rounds need not be consecutive. Maintaining your performance is a free action.</p>
				<p><b>Saga of Future Kings (Supreme, Su): </b>Each ally who benefits from your song of valor gains DR/&#151; equal to your spirit bonus. In addition, when an ally affected by your song would be reduced to fewer than 0 hit points, she can attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half the damage received). If the ally succeeds, she instead is reduced to 0 hit points.</p>

				<p>If Taldaris was the greatest leader of the empire&#146;s history, then Grand Prince Gennaris III was unquestionably Taldor&#146;s greatest general. No one before or since led as effective a campaign against the Qadiran encroachment as Gennaris, and the brevity of his time as an emperor only strengthened his legacy as a martyr. Few leaders have been so widely loved and so deeply mourned. Renowned for his tactical brilliance as well as his personal might, Gennaris is held up as a paragon of excellence to which Taldan warriors have since aspired. Those seeking to channel the Conqueror&#146;s legendary spirit know they must prove their own worth before they merit the attention of Gennaris&#146;s spirit.</p>
				<p><b>Gaining Favor: </b>To gain the favor of Gennaris, you must gather six weapons, each from defeating a significant enemy (a foe whose CR equals at least your character level &#150; 3). Surrounded by the assembled weapons, you must recount the tales of the battles in which you obtained them and swear an oath that you will become a master of each of them. This requires a Strength check. If you succeed, Gennaris answers your call.</p>
				<p><b>Taboos: </b>If you accept a taboo while channeling Gennaris, you must face your opponents with confidence and never retreat from a fight out of cowardice.</p>
				<p><b>Conqueror's Weapons (Lesser, Su): </b>You are considered proficient with the weapon types you gathered in order to gain favor with this spirit (such as longswords or hand crossbows).</p>
				<p><b>Conquered Blades (Greater, Su): </b>You gain Improved Critical with the weapon types you gathered to gain favor with this spirit. In addition, your attacks with such weapons ignore up to 5 points of damage reduction, except for damage reduction without a type (such as DR 10/&#151;).</p>

				<p>The Heretic warps the faith of a good deity.</p>
				<p><b>Gaining Favor: </b>To gain the Heretic&#146;s favor, you must first pervert the worship of a congregation of worshipers of a good deity to evil. You must then vow to corrupt, debase, and violate the worship of that deity and never perform a truly altruistic act, and finally succeed at a Charisma check.</p>
				<p><b>Spirit Bonus: </b>The Heretic warps the faith of a good deity.</p>
				<p><b>Seance Boon: </b>For the purpose of spells and effects that have an effect based on which deity you worship, you count as worshiping the deity chosen in your vow. For the purpose of divinations, your alignment is the same as the deity&#146;s, and you have an aura corresponding to that deity&#146;s alignment as if you were a cleric of that deity. This doesn&#146;t alter other effects based on alignment, like smite evil.</p>
				<p><b>Favored Locations: </b>Hidden shrines, repositories of dark knowledge, sacrificial altars, temples.</p>
				<p><b>Heresy (Lesser, Su): </b>This functions as the divine surge lesser spirit power but you gain the following inquisitor spells at the indicated spell levels, instead of selecting a set of cleric spells each day: 0&#151;guidance; 1st&#151;divine favor; 2nd&#151; castigateAPG; 3rd&#151;terrible remorseUM; 4th&#151;reprobationUM; 5th&#151; mass castigateAPG; 6th&#151;overwhelming presenceUM. Whenever you use your spirit surge on a skill check or ability check to convince or trick someone into perverting his faith in the good deity you chose with your vow, the Heretic is pleased and does not gain the usual point of influence over you.</p>
				<p><b>False Front (Intermediate, Su): </b>You gain the effects of the energy font intermediate spirit power, but you must match the faith you chose to pervert, meaning that you always channel positive energy and add cure spells.</p>
				<p><b>Stolen Grace (Greater, Su): </b>When a member of your chosen faith who believes that you are a member of that faith&#146;s clergy requests you to cast a cleric spell of a spell level you can cast, you can allow the Heretic to gain 1 point of influence over you and expend a spell slot of the appropriate level to cast the spell.</p>

He was selected by his village to be blessed by the cyclopes of the isle, who told the young vintner that tragedy would precede his mythic ascension. Sure enough, Kelksiomides returned home to find his whole village slaughtered. The culprits were captured, but Kelksiomides forgave them, an act that was rewarded by the gods. Kelksiomides stands for hope in the face of despair, for new growth, and for redemption.</p>
				<p><b>Gaining Favor: </b>To gain Kelksiomides&#146;s favor, you must travel to the hills of Pol-Ptirmeios, where the hero-god was born. There you must swear to never bear a grudge against another, even if you have been grievously wronged. You must then succeed at a Wisdom check, and if you do, Kelksiomides will answer your call.</p>

				<p>The Lich is a spirit of power over death and the undead.</p>
				<p><b>Gaining Favor: </b>To gain the Lich&#146;s favor, you must research fragments of how to create a personal phylactery and then outline a plan for lichdom. This requires spending 2 months visiting libraries and sites of necromantic power, followed by a successful Intelligence check. You must then vow to never destroy an intelligent undead creature, even if it attacks you first (though it is perfectly acceptable to control it with magic).</p>

				<p><b>Favored Locations: </b>Battlefields, graveyards, tombs.</p>

				<p><b>Lesser Lichdom (Greater, Su): </b>In order to benefit from this power, you must have a proto-phylactery that costs you 10,000 gp to create (if you continue with the process of lichdom, you can upgrade this to a true phylactery by paying the difference in cost). If you die while channeling the Lich, you return from the dead in 1d10 days, reforming around the proto-phylactery and gaining 1 permanent negative level (as if subject to the resurrection spell). This process consumes the proto-phylactery. If you are already a lich, you can instead create a backup phylactery for 10,000 gp, at which you reform if your normal phylactery is destroyed. This consumes the backup phylactery.</p>

There, you must swear to help gather the descendants of Ninshabur and to tell all of Namzaruum&#146;s inevitable return. You must also succeed at a Charisma check before Namzaruum will answer your call.</p>
				<p><b>Taboos: </b>If you accept a taboo while channeling Namzaruum, you must take any opportunity to seek out Ninshaburian descendants and proselytize, even if doing so would be disadvantageous.</p>
				<p><b>Phalanx Defense (Lesser, Su): </b>This functions as the marshal&#146;s order ability, except if you or an ally who participated in your seance are adjacent to another ally who participated, you and any applicable allies can also add your spirit surge to your CMD against bull rush, drag, overrun, and trip attempts.</p>
				<p>This alters marshal&#146;s order.</p>
				<p><b>Slumbering Sword (Greater, Su): </b>When an ally within 30 feet is attacked, you can allow Namzaruum to gain 1 point of influence over you as an immediate action to provide partial cover to that ally for a single attack. The ally must be able to see and hear you for this ability to function. If the attack against your ally misses, your ally can make an attack of opportunity against the enemy who made the attack if that enemy is within your ally&#146;s reach.

			<name type="string">Nex (Archmage)</name>
			<text type="formattedtext">
				<p>Nex&#146;s legendary spirit offers the power of one of the greatest archmages in Golarion&#146;s history. Unlike normal archmage spirits, Nex&#146;s legendary spirit grants strange abilities shaped by the lost wizard&#146;s unique experiments. Mediums channeling Nex&#146;s legendary spirit eventually realize that the spirit has its own long-term plans for them, usually involving the Spire of Nex, but so far no medium has gleaned the full scope of that plan.</p>
				<p>The Nex legendary spirit grants modified or unique spirit powers. In all other ways, it functions identically to a standard archmage spirit (Occult Adventures 33).</p>
				<p><b>Gaining Favor: </b>For use with the Nexian Channeler archetype only.</p>
				<p><b>Spirit Bonus: </b>When you channel Nex, your spirit bonus applies on concentration checks, Intelligence checks, and Intelligence-based skill checks.</p>
				<p><b>Seance Boon: </b>Your damaging spells deal an additional 2 points of damage of the same type that they would normally deal to each target.</p>
				<p><b>Favored Locations: </b>Arcane redoubts, areas of unusual magic, libraries, schools.</p>
				<p><b>Influence Penalty: </b>Your body begins to respond as if you were a frail, aged scholar. You take a penalty equal to your spirit bonus on Strength checks, Strength-based skill checks, Constitution checks, attack rolls, and non-spell damage rolls.</p>
				<p><b>Taboos: </b>Choose one: You eschew all faith in the divine, so you must not be the willing target of divine spells or abilities and you must attempt a Will saving throw against even harmless divine spells and abilities; you must not pass up the opportunity to learn something new and significant (a nontrivial piece of information with a Knowledge check of DC 20 or higher) when that opportunity is directly present; you must use your own magical solution to a challenge if you can, even if a mundane solution that would require fewer resources is available.</p>
				<p><b>Nex's Arcana (Lesser, Su): </b>Rather than your normal spells per day for your medium level, you gain the spells per day from Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist (Occult Adventures 39). For each level of spell you can now cast (including level 0), each time you channel Nex&#146;s spirit, select a single spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list of that level to add to your medium spell list and spells known until you lose contact with Nex. When you cast these spells, they count as arcane (though not for the purpose of fulfilling prerequisites), and thus you must provide verbal and somatic components instead of thought and emotion components. Because of Nex&#146;s hatred of Geb, these spells can&#146;t be of the necromancy school.</p>
				<p><b>Project Servitor (Intermediate, Su): </b>You can create projections of the creatures trapped in the Spire of Nex, just as Nex did during his siege of Absalom. You can expend a spell slot to cast shadow conjuration, mimicking a summon monster or summon nature&#146;s ally spell of the spell slot&#146;s level (or that spell slot&#146;s level + 1 for 5th- and 6th-level slots). These shadows are 10% real per level of the spell slot expended. If you allow Nex to gain 1 point of inf luence over you, double the reality percentage (to a maximum of 100%; if the result would be greater than 100%, the creature or creatures instead gain the advanced template).</p>
				<p><b>Wild Arcana (Greater, Su): </b>You can allow Nex to gain 1 point of inf luence over you in order to cast any sorcerer/wizard spell of a level you can cast (even necromancy spells). You must expend a spell slot of the appropriate level, and you can&#146;t apply metamagic feats to the spell.</p>
				<p><b>Personal Spire (Supreme, Su): </b>Nex&#146;s legendary spirit grants you access to a personal demiplane that you create (as per one created by create greater demiplane). As long as you channel Nex each day, your demiplane remains, but if you ever channel a spirit from a different legend, the demiplane disappears, dumping its inhabitants onto the Astral Plane. You can use project servitor to summon a shadowy projection of any creature currently within your demiplane, as long as its CR matches the summon spell (CR 1/2 or lower for summon monster I, CR 1 for summon monster II, CR 2 for summon monster III, CR 3 or 4 for summon monster IV, CR 5 or 6 for summon monster V, CR 7 or 8 for summon monster VI, or CR 9 or 10 for summon monster VII). You can allow Nex to gain 1 point of influence over you and expend a 6th-level spell slot to use project servitor as per summon monster VIII (80% real and can mimic trapped creatures of CR 11 or 12) or summon monster IX (90% real and can mimic trapped creatures of CR 13 or 14).</p>

				<p><b>Azlanti Heroics (Lesser, Su): </b>Savith grants a +1 bonus on all attack rolls when you are wielding a greatsword in melee combat against evil monstrous humanoids instead of granting proficiency in an exotic weapon with champion&#146;s prowess. For the legendary champion ability, Savith grants any two of the following feats: Disruptive, Greater Weapon Focus (greatsword), Greater Weapon Specialization (greatsword), Weapon Focus (greatsword), Weapon Specialization (greatsword), and Spellbreaker. This ability alters champion&#146;s prowess and legendary champion.</p>
				<p><b>Toe to Toe (Intermediate, Sp): </b>When you are in melee combat with a creature that is at least one size category larger than you, if none of your allies are flanking it, you can spend a swift action to increase your own size as if through enlarge person, gaining all the effects of that spell. This does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and the effect lasts as long as you are in melee with that creature or until it is dead.</p>

				<p>The Bounty Prince was blessed with many advantages: great charm, noble leadership, and adamant will. His stalwart defense of Taldor against the perceived incursions and offenses of the Sarenites&#151;starting with those whose divinations sparked strife between Stavian and his own brothers&#151;showed his resolve for protecting the nation against the might of divine magic in enemy hands. While some have questioned the necessity of the Great Purge, none can argue the effectiveness with which Stavian pursued his enemies.

To gain Stavian&#146;s favor, you must destroy an altar or other permanent fixture dedicated to a deity or religion whose followers have wronged you.

				<p><b>Magical Purge (Intermediate, Su): </b>Stavian grants you protection against the magical power of your enemies. You gain spell resistance equal to 11 + your medium level.</p>

				<p><b>Gaining Favor: </b>To gain Sulesh&#146;s favor, you must travel to the Padishah Empire of Kelesh, or to any place where genie binders exist, and prove your knowledge about all manner of genies. This requires a successful Intelligence check. You must then vow to never release a genie from its bonds, even if you did not bind it. Sulesh the Great then answers your call.</p>
				<p><b>Taboos: </b>If you accept a taboo while channeling Sulesh, you must not suffer the presence of a rival&#146;s summoned creatures and must target them if possible during combat, even if doing so would be disadvantageous to your allies.</p>

				<p><b>Master Summoner (Intermediate, Su): </b>A number of times per day equal to 1/2 your medium level (minimum 1), you can cast any summon monster spell as a standard action instead of a full-round action.

			<text type="formattedtext">
				<p>Never since the days of Taldor&#146;s founding has there been any leader so capable of unification as the one who brought together the disparate city-states vying for power along the northeastern coast of the Inner Sea. Already legendary when crowned Grand Prince of Oppara, Taldaris nevertheless went on to conquer neighboring territories and found the Principalities of Taldaris, a nascent entity destined to become the greatest empire in the Inner Sea region. Those who seek to channel the spirit of Taldaris must show courage, honor, and integrity, with noble goals of leadership and unification in the face of adversity.</p>
				<p><b>Gaining Favor: </b>To gain the favor of Taldaris, you must be publicly recognized as the leader of an organization of 50 or more individuals and swear an oath to ensure the cohesion of that group. This requires a Charisma check; if you succeed, Taldaris answers your call.</p>
				<p><b>Taboos: </b>If you accept a taboo while channeling Taldaris, you must place the interests of the many above your own, and you must not take any actions that would cause you to benefit at the expense of your allies or your allies&#146; collective goals.</p>
				<p><b>Legion Leader (Intermediate, Su): </b>You gain a teamwork feat of your choice for which you meet the prerequisites. All of your allies who joined in the shared seance also gain this feat as a bonus feat, even if they do not meet the prerequisites. You can choose a different feat each time you channel this spirit.</p>
				<p><b>First Emperor's Order (Supreme, Su): </b>You have no limit on the number of times you can use spirit surge in a round, although you can&#146;t use it more than once on any d20 roll. When the spirit of Taldaris gains influence over you for using the marshal&#146;s order spirit power on an ally&#146;s check, further uses of marshal&#146;s order before the start of that creature&#146;s next turn do not cause the spirit to gain additional influence over you.</p>

In addition to the battles themselves, this requires a Constitution check. If you succeed, you must swear an oath to never retreat from combat and to eschew all mercy, always killing unconscious, captured, or surrendered foes, regardless of extenuating circumstances.</p>
				<p><b>Favored Locations: </b>Arenas, fortifications under siege, places of violence.</p>
				<p><b>Bloodless (Lesser, Su): </b>You automatically stabilize when at negative hit points, and you are killed only if your negative hit point total exceeds double your Constitution score. In addition, you can allow the Terminator to gain 1 point of influence over you to automatically end any bleed or blood drain effect or effect with the painUM descriptor. Doing so is not an action, so you can do this even if you are unconscious.</p>

				<p><b>Gaining Favor: </b>To gain the Prince&#146;s favor, you must climb atop the 90-foot-tall Arodennama in Westcrown. There, you must pour oil down the statue&#146;s cheeks, then set the oil afire. You must vow to seek political influence, and then succeed at a Charisma check (DC = 10 + half your medium level).

You can also use your spirit surge when an enemy takes an action that would provoke an attack of opportunity from you or such an ally who threatens that enemy. If you do so, you or an ally of your choice who threatens that enemy can make an attack of opportunity and add your spirit surge, and that attack of opportunity does not count against your normal limit for the round or your ally&#146;s. When you use a spirit surge on an attack roll and the attack hits, the spirit surge benefit also applies to the damage roll.</p>
				<p><b>Warmonger's Way (Intermediate, Su): </b>Add the following spells of spell levels you can currently cast to your list of spells known of those levels: 1st&#151;command, murderous commandUM; 2nd&#151;rage, tactical acumenUC; 3rd&#151;confusion, fear; 4th&#151;battlemind linkUM, song of discord. You can also use your spirit surge on concentration and caster level checks when you cast these spells.</p>
				<p><b>Inspiring Call (Greater, Su): </b>You gain the marshal&#146;s intermediate spirit power of the same name, but you can activate it as a move action. This improves to a swift action if you have the legendary marshal legendary spirit power.</p>

				<p>A mesmerist&#146;s telekinetic assault renders foes around the subject less of a threat. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when either an enemy moves adjacent to the subject or the subject begins her turn with one or more enemies adjacent to her. The mesmerist can either lift all enemies adjacent to the subject slightly into the air or push them all away from the subject. Lifting enemies causes them to move at half speed and take a &#150;4 penalty to their CMDs against bull rush, drag, and reposition attempts for 1 round (Will negates). The speed reduction and CMD penalty don&#146;t stack with those from hostile levitation (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 231). Pushing enemies away requires the mesmerist to attempt a bull rush combat maneuver check using his mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier as his CMB. Any enemy that&#146;s successfully pushed moves away from the subject of the trick using the normal rules for a bull rush.</p>

The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject becomes affected by a minor condition listed under the touch treatment ability.

This has no effect on any conditions affecting the subject other than the triggering condition, even if those other effects are also listed under touch treatment. The rounds during which the subject ignores the triggering effect still count against that effect&#146;s duration; if the duration of mask misery is longer than the effect lasts, the subject isn&#146;t affected by the condition at all. If an effect that imposes more than one condition triggers this trick, the subject ignores all eligible conditions. If the mesmerist is 6th level or higher, he adds the moderate conditions to the conditions he can ignore with this trick, and this trick ends minor conditions entirely instead of suppressing them temporarily. The mesmerist doesn&#146;t need to have touch treatment to choose or use this trick.</p>

				<p>sychic feedback causes an enemy to suffer from the same weakening effect it imposes on the subject. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when an attack or spell used by an enemy causes the subject to take ability damage, ability drain, bleed damage, or a minor or moderate condition listed under the touch treatment class feature. If the trick is triggered by ability damage, ability drain, or bleed damage, the amount of damage or drain the subject takes is reduced by 2 points (to a minimum of 0 points), and the creature that made the attack or cast the spell takes 2 points of ability damage to an ability score of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. The monster can attempt a Will save to negate the ability damage. This ability can be used if the attacker inflicts a curse, disease, or poison that deals ability damage or drain, but only if it deals that damage immediately, with no onset time. If the trick is triggered by the subject gaining a condition, the subject is still affected by the condition, but the attacker takes a condition of the mesmerist&#146;s choice for 1 round. This condition must come from the minor condition or moderate condition lists of the touch treatment class feature. The enemy can attempt a Will save to avoid gaining the condition.

The damage the subject takes is reduced by an amount equal to 3 + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier (to a maximum of the total amount of damage the attack deals). Another creature within range of the original attack, other than the attacker, is affected by a shadow illusion that makes it appear as if the attacker is attacking that creature instead of the attacker&#146;s actual target. This second creature takes an amount of damage equal to the amount by which the attack&#146;s damage was reduced. This shadow doesn&#146;t require a roll to hit and ignores cover and concealment, but the target can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the effect. If it succeeds at this save, it neither takes the damage nor believes the attacker targeted it.

				<p>The subject changes shape to elude an attacking enemy. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject takes damage from an enemy&#146;s attack. The subject transforms into a bird (as beast shape III). Though the subject can appear as any Tiny bird, it uses the statistics for a raven (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 133). This is a polymorph effect.</p>

				<p>A ward curses an enemy who attacks the subject. While this trick is implanted, a visible, circular symbol appears on the subject&#146;s forehead. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is attacked or becomes the target of a spell that requires an attack roll. The attacker takes a &#150;4 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks for 1 minute per mesmerist level (Will negates). This penalty applies to the triggering attack roll. This is a curse effect.</p>

				<p>The subject appears to die, but actually can stealthily move about. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is damaged by an attack. The subject seems to fall down dead (as programmed image), but actually turns invisible (as invisibility) for a number of rounds equal to the mesmerist&#146;s level or until she attacks. Once the subject becomes visible again, the illusory dead body disappears. These are illusion effects, and a creature that interacts with the false body can attempt a saving throw to disbelieve the effect. The false body is a figment; the invisibility is a glamer.</p>

			<text type="formattedtext">
				<p>Mental commands placed deep in the subject&#146;s mind trigger when she would fall under mind control, allowing the mesmerist to control her instead. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is affected by a charm or compulsion effect created by an enemy. The subject acts as though the mesmerist had cast the spell instead of the enemy. For instance, if the subject were affected by charm monster cast by an enemy, that enemy can&#146;t try to give her orders, but the mesmerist could. If the charm or compulsion causes penalties or conditions (such as those imposed by confusion, crushing despair, or hold person), the subject can ignore any of those penalties or conditions the mesmerist chooses. This trick overrides the charm or compulsion for a number of rounds equal to the mesmerist&#146;s level or until the duration of the triggering effect elapses, whichever comes first. The mesmerist can&#146;t implant this trick on himself.</p>

Once triggered, this effect lasts for 1 round per mesmerist level or until the subject enters an area of normal or brighter light.</p>

The mesmerist can trigger this trick when an enemy moves adjacent to or attacks either the subject or the mesmerist, provided the subject and the mesmerist are within 100 feet of one another. The subject and the mesmerist then swap positions. If this trick was triggered by an attack, the swap happens before checking to see whether the attack hits. The mesmerist can&#146;t implant this trick on himself. This is a conjuration (teleportation) effect.</p>

				<p>The mesmerist can choose a spell to strike back at enemy spellcasters. When the mesmerist implants this trick, he must expend one spell slot to couple a spell he knows of that level with the trick. That spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less and be able to target one creature (spells like dominate person that have more restrictive targeting can be used, but have no effect if triggered against creatures that don&#146;t match). He can trigger this trick when the subject is targeted by an enemy&#146;s spell. The mesmerist&#146;s spell then triggers, affecting only the enemy spellcaster. This takes effect only if the enemy spellcaster is within range of the spell (as measured from the subject of the trick), and functions as though the mesmerist were in the subject&#146;s square. The enemy&#146;s spell still has its full effect, even if the mesmerist&#146;s spell would normally protect against it or make the caster unable to cast it.</p>

				<p>A monk can set up vibrations within the body of another creature that can thereafter be fatal if the monk so desires. Using this ability is a standard action that costs 4 ki points, and the monk must announce his intent to use this ability (and spend the ki points) before making the attack roll. Creatures immune to critical hits cannot be affected. Otherwise, if the attack hits and the target takes damage from the blow, the quivering palm attack succeeds. Thereafter, the monk can try to slay the victim at any time within a number of days equal to his monk level. To make such an attempt, the monk merely wills the target to die (a free action); unless the target succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the monk&#146;s level + the monk&#146;s Wisdom modifier), it dies. If the saving throw is successful, the target is no longer in danger from that particular quivering palm attack, but it can still be affected by another one at a later time. A monk can have no more than one quivering palm in effect at one time. If a monk uses quivering palm while another is still in effect, the previous one is negated. A monk must be at least 16th level before selecting this ki power.</p>

In addition, whenever the ninja is poisoned, the time between saving throws (the poison's frequency) is doubled. Thus, a poison that has a frequency of &#147;1/round for 6 rounds&#148; would instead be &#147;1/2 rounds for 12 rounds.&#148;</p>

				<p>As a full-round action, a ninja with this master trick can take careful aim and pool all of her attack potential into a single, deadly shuriken throw. When she does this, she throws a single shuriken at a single target, but makes as many attack rolls as she can, based on her base attack bonus. She makes the attack rolls in order from highest bonus to lowest, as if she were making a full attack. If any of the attack rolls hit the target, the attack hits. For each additional successful attack roll beyond the first, the ninja increases the damage by 1d6. Precision damage and extra damage from weapon special abilities (such as flaming) are added with damage modifiers and are not increased by this advanced talent. If one or more rolls are critical threats, she confirms the critical once using her highest base attack bonus &#150;5. For each critical threat beyond the first, she reduces this penalty by 1 (to a maximum of 0).</p>

				<p>Abjuration implements are objects associated with protection and wards.</p>
				<p><b>Implements: </b>Amulet, armor, bell, bracers, brooch, cloak, holy symbol, shield.</p>
				<p><b>Resonant Power: </b>Each time the occultist invests mental focus into an abjuration implement, the implement grants the following resonant power. The implement&#146;s bearer gains the benefits of this power until the occultist refreshes his focus.</p>
				<p><i>Warding Talisman (Su): </i>The implement wards against adverse effects. Whoever wears (or holds, for bells) the implement gains a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws for every 2 points of mental focus invested in the implement, to a maximum bonus of 1 + 1 for every 4 occultist levels you possess.</p>
				<p><b>Base Focus Power: </b>All occultists who learn to use abjuration implements gain the following focus power.</p>
				<p><i>Mind Barrier (Sp): </i>As a swift action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to create a shield of mental energy around you that protects you from harm. The shield prevents a total of 2 points of damage per occultist level you possess. It lasts until the start of your next turn or until exhausted. For example, if you are 5th level, the mind barrier protects you from 10 points of damage; if you are hit by an attack that would deal 12 points of damage, the mind barrier is exhausted and you take 2 points of damage. You can activate this ability as an immediate action, but doing so costs 2 points of mental focus instead of 1.</p>
				<p><b>Focus Powers: </b>In addition to gaining the base focus power, occultists who learn to use abjuration implements can select from the following focus powers when choosing the powers gained from their focus powers class feature.</p>
				<p><i>Aegis (Su): </i>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus and touch a suit of armor or a shield to grant it an enhancement bonus. The bonus is equal to 1 + 1 for every 6 occultist levels you possess (to a maximum bonus of +4 at 18th level). Enhancement bonuses gained via this ability stack with those of the armor or shield, to a maximum total enhancement bonus of +5. You can also imbue the armor or shield with any one armor or shield special ability that has an equivalent enhancement bonus less than or equal to your maximum bonus granted by this ability by reducing the granted enhancement bonus by the appropriate amount. The item must have an enhancement bonus of at least +1 (from the item itself or from aegis) to gain an armor or shield special ability. In either case, these bonuses last for 1 minute.</p>
				<p><i>Energy Shield (Sp): </i>As a swift action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to surround yourself with a shield that protects you from energy damage. Whenever you take acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, the shield absorbs the damage (as protection from energy). The energy shield can absorb up to 5 points of energy damage per occultist level you possess. This shield lasts for 1 minute or until its power is exhausted. Its effect doesn&#146;t stack with itself, with protection from energy, or with resist energy. You can activate the energy shield as an immediate action by expending 2 points of mental focus instead of 1. You must be at least 3rd level to select this focus power.</p>
				<p><i>Globe of Negation (Sp): </i>As a standard action, you can expend 3 points of mental focus to create a stationary globe of negation. This globe is 10 feet in diameter and cancels any spell effect that is cast into or through its area. This functions as globe of invulnerability, but it affects spells of any level. The globe can negate a total number of spell levels equal to your occultist level, after which the globe collapses. Spells that exceed the number of remaining levels remove all remaining levels, but are weakened; any creatures targeted by such spells receive a +4 circumstance bonus on any saving throws against the spells&#146; effects. The globe lasts for a number of rounds equal to your occultist level. It has no effect on spells originating within the globe&#151;only on those that enter its area as or after they are cast. You must be at least 11th level to select this focus power.</p>
				<p><i>Loci Sentry (Sp): </i>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to set a ward about an area. This area has a maximum radius of 10 feet + 5 feet per occultist level you possess. Whenever a creature enters the area, a sentry manifested by your psyche appears and strikes out at the intruder. The affected creature must succeed at a Will save or be dazed for 1 round. You are immediately aware of the sentry&#146;s activation. The sentry lasts for up to 1 hour per occultist level you possess, or until triggered. When you set the sentry, you can set any number of specif ic creatures to be immune to the sentry and thus avoid triggering it.</p>
				<p><i>Planar Ward (Sp): </i>As a standard action, you can expend 2 points of mental focus to surround yourself with a planar ward. Creatures not native to the plane that you are currently on take a &#150;4 penalty on attacks against you, and you receive a +4 circumstance bonus on saving throws against the spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities of such creatures. This ward lasts for 1 minute.</p>
				<p><i>Unraveling (Sp): </i>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to unravel a magical effect. This functions as a targeted dispel magic spell, but you must be adjacent to the effect to unravel it. If the effect is created by psychic magic, you receive a +5 bonus on your caster level check to unravel it. If the effect targets an object in your possession, you automatically succeed at the check. You must be at least 5th level to select this focus power.</p>

This ward burns undead creatures, dealing an amount of damage equal to 1d4 + 1d4 per 2 occultist levels you have when the undead enter the ward and each round they begin their turns within this area of effect. The warded area moves with you and can be used only defensively. Any attempt to force the ward against an undead creature immediately ends the effect.</p>

This implement can be used as the item in question, functioning as a masterwork version of that item, and can also be used to cast your psychic spells, even though you did not select it at the beginning of the day. If you have more than one implement for the same school, decide which set of spells the conjured implement will grant when you first conjure it. The implement can&#146;t be used to store mental focus or create any effects that require mental focus. The implement lasts for 10 minutes per occultist level you possess.</p>
				<p><i>Flesh Mend (Sp): </i>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to heal a living creature with a touch. The creature is healed an amount of damage equal to 1d8 + your occultist level. For every 4 occultist levels you possess beyond 3rd, the creature is healed an additional 1d8 points of damage, to a maximum of 5d8+19 at 19th level. This has no effect on undead creatures. You must be at least 3rd level to select this focus power.</p>
				<p><i>Mind Steed (Sp): </i>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to conjure a spectral horse. This horse can be either Medium or Large, but it otherwise functions as mount. The horse lasts for 10 minutes per occultist level you possess. If you are at least 5th level, the mount&#146;s base land speed increases by 20 feet. If you are at least 9th level and you expend 1 additional point of mental focus, the mount can fly at a speed of 60 feet with good maneuverability, but doing so reduces the mount&#146;s duration to 1 minute per occultist level you possess.</p>
				<p><i>Psychic Fog (Sp): </i>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to create a cloud of fog. This fog lasts for 1 minute per occultist level you possess. It functions as fog cloud, except it can&#146;t be dispersed by wind. At 7th level, you can expend 1 additional point of mental focus when creating this fog, causing it to become more tangible and function as solid fog, except it doesn&#146;t slow down any creature that has psychic powers or that can cast psychic spells. When you create a solid fog in this way, its duration is reduced to 1 round per occultist level you possess. You must be at least 3rd level to select this focus power.</p>
				<p><i>Purge Corruption (Sp): </i>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to draw out the corruption from a creature. You must touch the target with your implement to use this power. This ability functions as either neutralize poison or remove disease, using your occultist level as the caster level. Each use of this ability can cure only one poison or one disease. You must be at least 5th level to select this focus power.</p>
				<p><i>Side Step (Sp): </i>You can create a temporary fissure in space by expending 1 point of mental focus. You can use this ability as part of a move action taken to move. The fissure begins in any square you designate and allows you to teleport to any other square you can see within 10 feet per occultist level. Stepping between these locations requires you to expend 5 feet of movement, and the movement through the rift does not provoke attacks of opportunity. This otherwise functions as teleport. You must be at least 7th level to select this focus power.</p>

				<p><i>Amber Prison (Su): </i>You can expend 3 points of mental focus to entomb a creature within 40 feet in an amberlike prison, rendering it paralyzed and unconscious for 1 minute per occultist level you have. The amber prison has 20 hit points; destroying the prison frees the creature. A successful Reflex save negates this entombment. Whether or not the saving throw is successful, the creature can&#146;t be the target of this focus power again for 1 day.</p>

The implement grants a +1 insight bonus on Perception checks per 2 points of mental focus stored in it, to a maximum bonus equal to the occultist&#146;s level. If the occultist is 3rd level or higher and stores at least 3 points of mental focus in it, the implement also grants lowlight vision. If the occultist is 5th level or higher and stores at least 6 points of mental focus in it, the implement also grants darkvision 60 feet. (If the bearer already has darkvision, the implement increases the range of the darkvision by 30 feet.) If the occultist is 7th level or higher and stores at least 9 points of mental focus in it, the implement also grants the effects of see invisibility. If the occultist is 13th level or higher and stores at least 12 points of mental focus in it, the implement also grants blindsense 60 feet.

				<p><i>Sudden Insight (Sp): </i>As a swift action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to gain an insight into your immediate future. You can use this foreknowledge as a free action before you roll any ability check, attack roll, or skill check to gain an insight bonus on that roll equal to 1/2 your occultist level (minimum +1). You can use your foreknowledge only once per turn, and if it&#146;s not used by the end of your turn, the insight fades and you gain no benefit.</p>

				<p><i>Danger Sight (Sp): </i>As an immediate action, you can protect yourself from harm by expending 1 point of mental focus. You can use this ability whenever you are the target of an attack or are required to attempt a saving throw against a special ability, spell, or trap. Doing so grants you an insight bonus to your AC or on your saving throw equal to 1/2 your occultist level. This bonus applies only to the next attack against you or saving throw you attempt, and if not applied by the end of the round, the protection fades and you gain no benefit. You must be at least 3rd level to select this focus power.</p>
				<p><i>Future Gaze (Sp): </i>As a standard action, you can gain an insight into the future by expending 1 point of mental focus. This functions as augury, using your occultist level as the caster level.</p>
				<p><i>Mind Eye (Sp): </i>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to create a mind eye&#151;a magical sensor through which you can see and hear. The mind eye is invisible and its size is Fine, giving it an AC of 18. Any amount of damage to the eye destroys it, but it can be harmed by only spells or magic weapons. The eye moves with a fly speed of 60 feet with perfect maneuverability and can travel up to 1 mile away from you. You must concentrate as a standard action to direct the eye and receive sensory images through it. The mind eye sees as your eyes see, including any additional senses you possess (such as darkvision or see invisibility). The mind eye lasts for 1 minute per occultist level you possess. You must be at least 5th level to select this focus power.</p>
				<p><i>Object Seer (Sp): </i>As a full-round action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to gain insight into an object in your possession. You can ask one question, but that question must be tied in some way to the object, such as the nature of its power, the identity of the creature that last possessed it, or even where the object was when a certain event took place. You always receive an answer from the psychic impressions imprinted upon the item, but they are sometimes cryptic or misleading. This ability otherwise functions as commune. You must be at least 7th level to select this focus power.</p>
				<p><i>Powerful Connection (Su): </i>When casting a divination spell (such as scrying) that imposes a penalty on saving throws based on the physical connection you have to the target, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to double the penalty from a possession, garment, or body part. In addition, when casting any other divination spell that allows a saving throw, you can increase the DC of that save by 2 by adding an object, garment, or body part that belonged to the target as a focus component for the spell and expending 1 point of mental focus.</p>
				<p><i>Watchful Eye (Sp): </i>You can expend 1 point of mental focus as a standard action to create an invisible sensor within 30 feet that watches a 5-foot-square area. Whenever any creature enters that square, you receive a mental image of the creature as long as you are on the same plane as the sensor. The sensor remains active for 10 minutes per occultist level you possess. The image will not wake you from slumber, although you do receive all of the images the sensor collected once you wake up. The sensor can be deceived by invisibility and similar magic. You can expend additional points of mental focus when creating the eye to increase the size of the square by 5 feet per additional point spent (to 10 feet square, 15 feet square, and so on).</p>

That foe is dazed for 1 round if the number of Hit Dice it possesses is less than or equal to or your occultist level. If it has more Hit Dice than your occultist level, it is staggered for 1 round instead. The foe can attempt a Will saving throw to negate the effect.

				<p><i>Forced Alliance (Sp): </i>As a standard action, you can alter a living creature&#146;s mind, causing it to see you as a friend and ally.

The creature can attempt a Will save to negate this effect. If it fails the saving throw, the creature treats you as an ally and doesn&#146;t attempt to harm you (although your allies are not protected).

This doesn&#146;t cause the creature to fall prone, but it does drop whatever it is holding. The creature can&#146;t take any actions while in this state, but it isn&#146;t helpless&#151; it perceives danger as part of its dream. The creature remains asleep for a number of rounds equal to your occultist level or until it takes any amount of damage, which immediately wakes it. At the end of each of its turns, it receives another Will saving throw to end the effect. The creature can be manipulated or examined without waking it, but it can&#146;t be moved from its square without waking it. This is a mindaffecting compulsion effect.

				<p><i>Intense Focus (Su): </i>The implement channels and enhances the effects of damaging evocations. A spellcaster who bears the implement can add the implement as an additional focus component for any of his damaging evocation spells that have an instantaneous duration or focus powers with an instantaneous duration. If he does so, the spell or focus power deals 1 additional point of damage of the same type to each creature for every 2 points of mental focus invested in the implement, to a maximum of 1 + 1 for every 2 occultist levels you possess.</p>

				<p><i>Energy Ward (Sp): </i>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to surround yourself in a swirling ward of energy. When you activate this power, you must select acid, cold, electricity, or fire. You gain resistance 10 against that energy type, and whenever a creature hits you with a melee weapon or natural weapon, that creature takes 1d6 points of energy damage of the chosen type. Attacks made with melee weapons with reach don&#146;t cause the attacker to take this damage.

If the light matrix is ever more than 30 feet away from you, it returns to hover over your shoulder. If you are at least 5th level, you can direct the light matrix to make a melee touch attack against one foe within 30 feet. If the attack hits, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds by a flash of light. If the attack hits, regardless of whether the target succeeds at the save, the light matrix immediately ends. The light matrix otherwise has a duration of 1 hour per occultist level you possess.

				<p><b>Implements: </b>Crystal, hat, mask, prism, ring.</p>
				<p><b>Resonant Power: </b>Each time the occultist invests mental focus into an illusion implement, the implement grants the following resonant power. The implement&#146;s bearer gains the benefits of this power until the occultist refreshes his focus.</p>
				<p><i>Distortion (Sp): </i>The implement allows its bearer to distort his form and location, protecting him from harm. As a standard action, the bearer can gain a concealment miss chance equal to 5% for every point of mental focus invested in the implement (to a maximum of 5% + 5% for every 2 occultist levels you possess) until the next time the bearer makes an attack. If this miss chance reaches 50%, it doesn&#146;t increase further, but the bearer gains all the benefits of invisibility. Creatures with see invisibility, true seeing, or similar abilities ignore the miss chance from this ability.</p>
				<p><b>Base Focus Power: </b>All occultists who learn to use illusion implements gain the following focus power.</p>
				<p><i>Minor Figment (Sp): </i>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to create a minor figment. This can function as either ghost sound or minor image. In either case, the effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your occultist level. If you are 7th level or higher, the figment lasts for a number of minutes equal to your occultist level, and you can cause the figment to change once during its duration when a specified condition occurs.</p>
				<p><b>Focus Powers: </b>In addition to gaining the base focus power, occultists who learn to use illusion implements can select from the following focus powers when choosing the powers gained from their focus powers class feature.</p>
				<p><i>Cloak Image (Sp): </i>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to hide your appearance behind an illusion, as disguise self. The effect lasts for 1 minute per occultist level you possess. At 5th level, you can instead expend 2 points of mental focus to appear as a creature of a different type, but you must remain the same size. At 7th level, you can expend 1 additional point of mental focus to target a willing creature other than yourself with this ability.</p>
				<p><i>Color Beam (Sp): </i>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to unleash a beam of cascading colors at any one target within 30 feet. Doing so requires a ranged touch attack. If the beam hits, the target is blinded for 1 round if it has a number of Hit Dice equal to or lower than your occultist level. A foe with a number of Hit Dice greater than your occultist level is instead dazzled for 1 round. The foe can attempt a Will save to negate the effect. Regardless of whether it succeeds at its save, the target is then immune to this effect for 1 day. This is a mind-affecting illusion effect.</p>
				<p><i>Masquerade (Sp): </i>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to take on the appearance of another creature that you touch. If the creature is not friendly to you, this requires a melee touch attack, but the target doesn&#146;t receive a saving throw to negate the effect. You gain a circumstance bonus on Disguise checks equal to your occultist level + 10, but only to look like the creature touched. This bonus doesn&#146;t stack with the bonuses from polymorph spells or spells like disguise self. While using this ability, you can change your disguise as a standard action by touching a different creature and assuming its appearance. You can end this effect at any time. This effect lasts for 10 minutes per occultist level you possess, but you can renew the duration at any time by expending 1 additional point of mental focus.

				<p><i>Mirage (Sp): </i>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to cloak an area in illusion, allowing you to change the area&#146;s appearance. You can affect up to one 5-footcube area for every occultist level you posses, changing the appearance in a way that seems natural to the surroundings, subject to GM discretion. You could, for example, hide a door or passageway, make a table appear to be covered in food, or even create the illusion of a pit. You can&#146;t make creatures or objects invisible with this power, but you can change the appearance of an object or create an illusion for creatures to hide behind. This functions as major image, and creatures that physically interact with the illusion in any way can attempt a Will save to see through the mirage. You must be at least 5th level to select this focus power.</p>
				<p><i>Shadow Beast (Sp): </i>As a standard action, you can call forth one or more beasts made of shadow by expending 1 point of mental focus. This functions as shadow conjuration, but it can be used to duplicate only the effects of summon monster spells. Creatures created with this spell deal 50% of the normal damage to those that disbelieve the illusion, and their nondamaging effects have only a 50% chance of affecting disbelieving targets. This can be used to duplicate any summon monster spell up to summon monster V. For every 2 additional levels you possess beyond 9th, the maximum spell level you can duplicate with this ability increases by 1 (to a maximum of summon monster IX at 17th level). Regardless of the spell duplicated, the creatures remain for 1 round per occultist level you possess. You must be at least 9th level to select this focus power.</p>
				<p><i>Unseen (Sp): </i>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to become invisible, as invisibility. This effect lasts for 1 minute per occultist level you possess. You can expend 2 points of mental focus instead of 1 to use this power on a willing adjacent creature instead of yourself. You can still see creatures you make invisible with this power. If the invisible creature makes an attack or otherwise takes an action that would cause the invisibility to end, you can immediately expend 1 additional point of mental focus to allow the creature to remain invisible if the creature is within 30 feet of you. You must be at least 3rd level to select this focus power.</p>

				<p>Implements that draw power from necromancy can control undead and harm the living.</p>
				<p><b>Implements: </b>Bone, coin, doll, drum, robe, skull.</p>
				<p><b>Resonant Power: </b>Each time the occultist invests mental focus into an necromancy implement, the implement grants the following resonant power. The implement&#146;s bearer gains the benefits of this power until the occultist refreshes his focus.</p>
				<p><i>Necromantic Focus (Su): </i>The implement grants its possessor greater power over the undead. Whoever possesses the implement can control an additional 2 Hit Dice of undead for every point of mental focus invested in the item (to a maximum number of Hit Dice equal to 4 &#215; your occultist level). Any spellcaster who bears the implement can add it as an additional focus component for a necromancy spell he casts to create undead. If he does so, he can create an additional number of HD of undead equal to the additional HD the implement allows him to control (apply this effect after doubling the HD of undead for desecrate, if applicable). Undead creatures take a &#150;1 penalty on saving throws against spells cast by the bearer of this implement for every 4 points of mental focus invested in this implement.</p>
				<p><b>Base Focus Power: </b>All occultists who learn to use necromancy implements gain the following focus power.</p>
				<p><i>Mind Fear (Sp): </i>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to cause a living creature to succumb to fear. The target must be within 30 feet of you, and it can attempt a Will saving throw to negate the effect. If the target fails the save and has a number of Hit Dice less than or equal to yours, it is frightened for 1d4 rounds. If the target fails the saving throw and has a number of Hit Dice greater than yours, it is instead shaken for 1d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
				<p><b>Focus Powers: </b>In addition to gaining the base focus power, occultists who learn to use necromancy implements can select from the following focus powers when choosing the powers gained from their focus powers class feature.</p>
				<p><i>Flesh Rot (Sp): </i>As a standard action, you can make a melee touch attack and expend 1 point of mental focus to cause the flesh of a living creature to rot and wither. If the attack hits, the target takes 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per occultist level you possess. For every 4 occultist levels you possess beyond 3rd, the target takes an additional 1d8 points of damage (to a maximum of 5d8 at 19th level). If you miss with the melee touch attack, this power is wasted with no effect. You must be at least 3rd level to select this focus power.</p>
				<p><i>Necromantic Servant (Sp): </i>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to raise a single human skeleton (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 250) or human zombie (Bestiary 288) from the ground to serve you for 10 minutes per occultist level you possess or until it is destroyed, whichever comes first. This servant has a number of hit points equal to 1/2 your maximum hit point total (not adjusted for temporary hit points or other temporary increases). It also uses your base attack bonus and gains a bonus on damage rolls equal to 1/2 your occultist level. At 5th level, whenever the necromantic servant would be destroyed, if you are within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) of the servant, you can expend 1 point of mental focus as an immediate action to cause the servant to return to full hit points. At 9th level, you can choose to give the servant the bloody or burning simple template (if it&#146;s a skeleton) or the fast simple template (if it&#146;s a zombie). At 13th level, when you take an immediate action to restore your servant, it splits into two servants. You can have a maximum number of servants in existence equal to 1/2 your occultist level. At 17th level, the servant gains a teamwork feat of your choice.</p>
				<p><i>Pain Wave (Sp): </i>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to unleash a wave of pain. This wave hits all creatures other than you in a 20-foot-radius burst centered on a point that you designate within 100 feet. All living creatures in this area are wracked with pain, gaining the sickened condition for 1 round per occultist level you possess. Affected creatures can attempt a Will save to reduce the duration to just 1 round. This is a mind-affecting painUM effect. You must be at least 7th level to select this focus power.</p>
				<p><i>Psychic Curse (Sp): </i>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to curse a living creature within 30 feet with your psychic magic. You can choose one of the following effects: memory lapse, mental block, or pain confusion. If you choose memory lapse, the target loses its memory of the past 1 hour per occultist level you possess. If you choose mental block, you can proscribe one specific action, such as attacking with a type of weapon, casting a specific spell, or something else suitably specific (subject to the GM&#146;s discretion). The target can&#146;t take that action without first succeeding at a Will save. If it fails, it can take other actions instead. If it attempts the prohibited action again on subsequent rounds, it gains a cumulative +2 bonus on the save until it succeeds. If you select pain confusion, the creature is confused for 1d4 rounds whenever it is damaged by a critical hit. The target can attempt a Will save to negate this effect. This effect lasts for 1 day per occultist level you possess. A creature can&#146;t be under the effects of more than one psychic curse at a time. This is a mind-affecting curseUM effect. You must be at least 5th level to select this focus power.</p>
				<p><i>Soulbound Puppet (Su): </i>As a full-round action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to create a soulbound puppet from a bone, doll, or skull. If you use a bone or a skull, your power builds a Tiny or Small flesh puppet around it that vaguely resembles the original creature from which the bones were taken. If the implement is a doll, the doll comes to life. Treat this as a familiar, using your occultist level as your wizard level to determine its powers and abilities. By using a bone or skull from the appropriate creature or a doll shaped like that creature, you can select any of the familiar choices available to a wizard. You can instead use a humanoid bone, doll, or skull, to give the puppet the base statistics of a homunculus (Bestiary 176), but without a fly speed or the poison bite or telepathic link abilities. No matter the form, this creature is a construct with an alignment matching your own. You can have no more than one soulbound puppet active at any given time. The soulbound puppet remains animated for 10 minutes per occultist level you possess.</p>
				<p><i>Spirit Shroud (Su): </i>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to surround yourself with a shroud of spirit energy. You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d6 + your occultist level. This shroud lasts for 1 minute per occultist level or until the temporary hit points are expended, whichever comes first. These temporary hit points stack with those from other sources, but not with those gained through multiple uses of this ability. At 4th level, as long as the shroud remains, you also gain a resistance bonus on all saving throws against death effects, fear effects, and any spells or effects that bestow negative levels or deal negative energy damage (if the spells or effects allow a save). This bonus is equal to 1 + 1 for every 4 occultist levels you possess beyond 4th. You must be at least 3rd level to select this focus power.</p>

				<p><i>Wake (Su): </i>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to inspire fits of grief in a single creature within 30 feet that can see and hear you. You fill the target with haunting visions of the deaths of loved ones and the brevity of life, and for 1 minute, the target&#146;s emotional vulnerability grants you a circumstance bonus equal to your occultist level on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks attempted against the target. If this implement is used in combat, these emotions instead distract your target, leaving it dazzled for 1 round per occultist level you have.</p>

				<p><b>Implements: </b>Belt, boots, sandals, vest, weapon.</p>
				<p><b>Resonant Power: </b>Each time the occultist invests mental focus into an transmutation implement, the implement grants the following resonant power. The implement&#146;s bearer gains the benefits of this power until the occultist refreshes his focus.</p>
				<p><i>Physical Enhancement (Su): </i>The implement enhances its bearer&#146;s body. When you invest mental focus in the implement, select a physical ability score. The implement grants a +2 temporary enhancement bonus to that physical ability score for every 3 points of mental focus invested in the implement (to a maximum of +2 at 1st level, plus an additional 2 for every 6 occultist levels you possess).</p>
				<p><b>Base Focus Power: </b>All occultists who learn to use transmutation implements gain the following focus power.</p>
				<p><i>Legacy Weapon (Su): </i>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus and touch a weapon to grant it an enhancement bonus. The bonus is equal to 1 + 1 for every 6 occultist levels you possess (to a maximum of +4 at 18th level). Enhancement bonuses gained by this ability stack with those of the weapon, to a maximum of +5. You can also imbue the weapon with any one weapon special ability with an equivalent enhancement bonus less than or equal to your maximum bonus by reducing the granted enhancement bonus by the appropriate amount. The item must have an enhancement bonus of at least +1 (from the item itself or from legacy weapon) to gain a weapon special ability. In either case, these bonuses last for 1 minute.</p>
				<p><b>Focus Powers: </b>In addition to gaining the base focus power, occultists who learn to use transmutation implements can select from the following focus powers when choosing the powers gained from their focus powers class feature.</p>
				<p><i>Mind Over Gravity (Sp): </i>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to give yourself a fly speed of 60 feet with perfect maneuverability. This effect lasts for 1 minute per occultist level you possess. You must be at least 7th level to select this focus power.</p>
				<p><i>Philosopher's Touch (Su): </i>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus and touch a weapon, causing it to gain the properties of a special material. You can cause the weapon to be treated as cold iron or silver for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction for 1 minute per occultist level you possess. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, you can touch an additional weapon as part of using this ability to grant that weapon the same benefit (still expending only 1 point of mental focus). At 11th level, you can cause any weapon affected by this ability to act as if it were adamantine instead (but only for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction, not for overcoming hardness).</p>
				<p><i>Quickness (Sp): </i>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to grant supernatural quickness and reflexes to yourself or a willing living creature you touch. This functions as haste, but the bonus to AC and on Reflex saving throws increases to +2. This effect lasts for 1 round per occultist level you possess. You must be at least 5th level to select this focus power.</p>
				<p><i>Size Alteration (Sp): </i>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus and touch a creature to alter its size. You can increase or decrease the creature&#146;s size by one step, as enlarge person or reduce person but not limited by the creature&#146;s type. If the creature is hostile toward you, using this ability requires a successful melee touch attack, and the creature can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the effect. This effect lasts for 1 round per occultist level you possess. You can&#146;t use this ability on a creature that is already subject to an effect that alters its size.</p>
				<p><i>Sudden Speed (Sp): </i>As a swift action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to grant yourself a burst of speed. This increases your land speed by 30 feet for 1 minute. This ability does not stack with itself.</p>
				<p><i>Telekinetic Mastery (Sp): </i>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to grant yourself telekinetic power. This functions as telekinesis, except you don&#146;t need to concentrate on the effect to maintain it, and using any one of its effects is a standard action. This effect lasts for 1 round per occultist level you possess. You must be at least 9th level to select this focus power.</p>

				<p><i>Parity (Su): </i>While casting a transmutation spell that provides you an enhancement bonus to a single mental or physical attribute, you can expend 1 point of mental focus as an immediate action to divide the bonus the spell provides, granting half to the original attribute affected by the spell and half to a corresponding attribute. Strength corresponds with Intelligence, Dexterity corresponds with Wisdom, and Constitution corresponds with Charisma. You can also use this ability to divide an ability score bonus granted by a magic item, but you must immediately expend 1 point of mental focus each day when you allocate mental focus to your implements to maintain the parity, or else the bonus immediately reverts to normal.</p>

				<p>This panoply is associated with the arcane arts and the masters of manipulating magic.</p>
				<p><b>Implements: </b>Crystal ball (divination), robe (necromancy), and wand (evocation).</p>
				<p><b>Resonant Power: </b>Each time the occultist invests mental focus into all of the associated implements, the panoply grants the following resonant power. The panoply&#146;s bearer gains the benefits of this power until the occultist refreshes his focus.</p>
				<p><i>Scholarly Knowledge (Su): </i>The panoply grants a +1 bonus on all Knowledge checks for every 4 points of total mental focus invested in all of the associated implements, to a maximum bonus equal to half the occultist&#146;s level. Additionally, the bearer is treated as being trained in all Knowledge checks for the purpose of determining whether or not he can succeed at Knowledge checks with a DC higher than 10. If the occultist is at least 5th level, the panoply&#146;s bearer can cast augury as a spell-like ability a total number of times per day equal to the greatest number of points of mental focus stored in any one of the associated implements.</p>
				<p><b>Base Focus Power: </b>All occultists who learn to use this panoply gain the following focus power.</p>
				<p><i>Arcane Inspiration (Sp): </i>By consulting a spellbook for 15 minutes, you can expend 1 or more points of mental focus to prepare a divination, evocation, or necromancy spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list that is contained in that spellbook. You must choose an unused spell slot for the prepared spell to occupy, and the chosen spell must be of a spell level equal to or lower than that spell slot. The number of points of mental focus you must expend is equal to the level of the spell slot used. You can apply metamagic effects to the prepared spell, if desired, and they increase the level of the spell slot the spell occupies as normal. Once the spell is prepared, you can cast it normally, using the prepared spell slot (you cannot use any of your other spell slots to cast it, restricting you to casting it only once per use of this ability). The spell is treated as a psychic spell.</p>
				<p><b>Focus Powers: </b>In addition to the base focus power, occultists who learn to use this panoply can select the following focus powers when choosing powers gained from their focus powers class feature.</p>
				<p><i>Metamagic Knowledge (Su): </i>As a standard action, you can expend 3 points of mental focus and choose a single metamagic feat you qualify for but do not know. You gain that metamagic feat until the next time you refresh your mental focus.</p>
				<p><i>Metamagic Master (Su): </i>As a free action while casting a spell, you can expend 1 or more points of mental focus to apply a metamagic feat you know to that spell without increasing the spell&#146;s casting time or the spell level of the spell slot it occupies. The number of points of mental focus you must expend to use this power is equal to the increase in spell levels the metamagic feat would normally require (minimum 1).</p>
				<p><i>Spell Power (Su): </i>As a free action while casting a spell, you can expend 2 points of mental focus to increase that spell&#146;s caster level by 2. At 12th and 18th levels, whenever you use this ability, you can spend an additional point of mental focus in order to increase the spell&#146;s caster level by an additional 1.</p>

				<p>This panoply is associated with those who deceive as well as those who entertain.</p>
				<p><b>Implements: </b>Mask (illusion) and musical instrument (enchantment).</p>
				<p><b>Resonant Power: </b>Each time the occultist invests mental focus into all of the associated implements, the panoply grants the following resonant power. The panoply&#146;s bearer gains the benefits of this power until the occultist refreshes his focus.</p>
				<p><i>Actor's Skill (Su): </i>The panoply grants a +1 bonus on Bluff, Disguise, and Perform checks for every 3 points of total mental focus invested in all of the associated implements, to a maximum bonus equal to half the occultist&#146;s level. The panoply also grants an equal bonus on saving throws against divination effects.</p>
				<p><b>Base Focus Power: </b>All occultists who learn to use this panoply gain the following focus power.</p>
				<p><i>False Persona (Su): </i>By spending 1 minute in meditation and expending 2 points of mental focus, you can create a psychic mask that obscures your identity. When you create this false persona, you choose the nature of the persona&#146;s alignment and magical auras, and can create a simple background of up to four basic facts about the persona. All divination spells that reveal information about you instead reveal information based on the false persona&#146;s background and aura information. Additionally, attempts to scry or magically locate you work only if the creature making such attempts knows that you and your current false persona are the same individual. Otherwise, the spell has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if you did not exist. This effect lasts up to 24 hours or until you next refresh your mental focus (whichever occurs first), though you can dismiss this false persona at any time before then as a fullround action. This effect fools only magical attempts to discern your identity or background, and has no effect on mundane means of gathering information about you.</p>
				<p><b>Focus Powers: </b>In addition to the base focus power, occultists who learn to use this panoply can select the following focus powers when choosing powers gained from their focus powers class feature.</p>
				<p><i>False Confidence (Sp): </i>By taking a standard action and expending 1 point of mental focus, you can instill incredible, boundless confidence in a single living creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher within 60 feet, granting that creature a +2 morale bonus on ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for 10 minutes. As a move action, you can shatter the feeling of confidence, leaving the target feeling hopeless and distraught. If you do, the target can immediately attempt a Will save to negate the effect, with a cumulative &#150;1 penalty for every 2 minutes the creature benefited from the morale bonus. If the target fails this save, it takes a &#150;2 penalty on ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for the remainder of the effect&#146;s duration. If the creature then fails an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check by 10 or more while subject to this penalty, the penalty changes to &#150;4.</p>
				<p><i>Hypnotic Gaze (Sp): </i>By taking a standard action and expending 1 point of mental focus, you can hypnotize a single creature within 60 feet that can see you. The target must succeed at a Will save or become fascinated for as long as you maintain the effect (a move action), plus 1 additional round. Fascinated creatures take a &#150;1 penalty on Will saving throws. For every 3 rounds that you maintain the effect, this penalty increases by 1 to a maximum penalty of &#150;4. Anything that ends the fascination effect also ends the penalty. A creature that succeeds at its saving throw to resist this effect is immune to that occultist&#146;s hypnotic gaze for 24 hours.</p>
				<p><i>Puppet Master (Sp): </i>By taking a standard action and expending 2 points of mental focus, you can implant a hypnotic suggestion in a creature. This functions as per suggestion (using your occultist level as the caster level), except that the saving throw DC is equal to 10 + half your occultist level + your Intelligence modifier, and if the target fails its saving throw, you can choose to have it forget everything that occurs while it is under the spell&#146;s effects, as well as any recollection of you using this ability on it. Memories forgotten in this way can be recovered with restoration or spells or effects that can restore lost memories (such as modify memory).</p>

				<p><i>Font of Healing (Su): </i>The panoply grants you mastery over healing magic. When you cast a cure spell (a spell with the &#147;cure&#148; in its name), you restore 1 additional hit point for every 3 points of total mental focus invested in all of the associated implements, to a maximum bonus equal to half the occultist&#146;s level. This doesn&#146;t apply to damage dealt to undead with the spell.</p>
				<p><b>Base Focus Power: </b>All occultists who learn to use this panoply gain the following focus power.</p>
				<p><i>Restoring Touch (Sp): </i>As a standard action, you can expend 2 points of mental focus to cure a living creature you touch of temporary ability damage. You cure 1 point of temporary ability damage to a single ability score for every 3 occultist levels you have. At 10th level, you can expend an additional point of mental focus to instead restore the same amount of permanent ability drain.</p>
				<p><b>Focus Powers: </b>In addition to the base focus power, occultists who learn to use this panoply can select the following focus powers when choosing powers gained from their focus powers class feature.</p>
				<p><i>Guardian Aura (Sp): </i>As a full-round action, you can expend 3 points of mental focus to emit a 20-foot-radius aura of protection that lasts for 1 minute. You and your allies within the aura gain a sacred bonus to AC equal to 1/4 of your occultist level (minimum +1). Your speed is reduced to 10 feet while this power is active, but you can dismiss it as a free action.</p>
				<p><i>Martyr's Benediction (Sp): </i>As an immediate action when you would be reduced to fewer than 0 hit points or killed (including by effects that kill without dealing damage, such as phantasmal killer and power word kill), you can expend 1 point of mental focus to restore a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + your occultist level all allies (other than you) within 30 feet. In addition, if any healed ally is under a fear effect, she can immediately attempt a new saving throw to end it.</p>
				<p><i>Rebuke Anathema (Sp): </i>As a standard action, you can present the holy symbol used as the panoply&#146;s associated implement and expend 2 points of mental focus to keep a single creature at bay. Your alignment must be within one step of that of the holy symbol&#146;s deity, and the creature&#146;s alignment must be more than one step away from both your alignment and the deity&#146;s alignment. If neither is the case, this power is ineffective and the spent mental focus is wasted. If the target creature fails a Will save, it can&#146;t move toward you for a number of rounds equal to your occultist level.</p>

				<p><i>Martial Skill (Ex): </i>When wielding the weapon used as the panoply&#146;s associated implement, you treat your base attack bonus as though it were 1 point higher for every 4 points of total mental focus invested in all of the associated implements, to a maximum base attack bonus equal to your occultist level. This increase can grant you additional attacks when using the full attack action (for example, a 12th-level occultist with 12 points of mental focus invested among the associated implements would be treated as having a base attack bonus of +11, with iterative attacks at a base attack bonus of +6 and +1).</p>
				<p><b>Base Focus Power: </b>All occultists who learn to use this panoply gain the following focus power.</p>
				<p><i>Combat Trick (Ex): </i>As a move action, you can expend 3 points of mental focus to gain a single combat feat for which you qualify. This benefit lasts for 1 minute.</p>
				<p><b>Focus Powers: </b>In addition to the base focus power, occultists who learn to use this panoply can select the following focus powers when choosing powers gained from their focus powers class feature.</p>
				<p><i>Counterstrike (Ex): </i>As an immediate action when you are damaged by a melee attack, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to immediately make a single attack at your highest base attack bonus against the creature that hit you, provided that you threaten that creature. If the attack hits, you gain a bonus on the damage roll equal to 1/3 your occultist level (rounded down, minimum +1). This attack counts as an attack of opportunity.</p>
				<p><i>Shield Ally (Ex): </i>As an immediate action when an adjacent ally is the target of a spell or attack, you can expend 2 points of mental focus to redirect that spell or attack to yourself instead. You must declare that you are using this ability before the result of any attack roll is known or before any saving throws are attempted.</p>
				<p><i>Warrior's Resilience (Su): </i>As an immediate action when you would be reduced to fewer than 0 hit points, you can expend 1 or more points of mental focus to remain at 0 hit points instead. Using this focus power costs 1 point of mental focus for every 5 points of damage below 0 that you would otherwise be reduced to (rounded up, minimum 1 point of mental focus). This has no effect on anything that would kill you without reducing your hit points below 0, such as a failed saving throw against a death effect.</p>

				<p>Your body is ravaged by a potent, slow-acting poison that resists all treatment. Whenever you must attempt a Fortitude save to resist a poison effect, roll twice and take the lowest result. Additionally, you need one more consecutive successful save to end an ongoing poison. You lose any immunity to poison you have upon receiving this curse, and you become immune to delay poison and neutralize poison, as well as other attempts to suppress or remove the poison from which you are suffering. You gain the poison use ability. At 5th level, you are so envenomed that your touch becomes poisonous. Once per day for every 4 oracle levels you have, you can deliver a unique contact poison as a touch attack or via an unarmed strike or natural weapon. This poison deals 1d2 points of Dexterity damage per round for 5 rounds. Poisoned creatures can attempt a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your oracle level + your Charisma modifier) each round. Success negates the damage and ends the affliction. At 10th level, the poison deals 1d3 points of Dexterity damage per round for 7 rounds. At 15th level, you can expend a use of your poison touch to transfer any poison effect you are currently experiencing from yourself to another creature. The touched creature must immediately attempt a saving throw against the poison (using the poison&#146;s initial DC and duration for a single dose, regardless of how many doses are currently affecting you). If the creature fails its save, the poison ceases to act on you, as if you had succeeded at all the necessary saves (this bypasses your immunity to effects that remove poison).</p>

Whenever you cast a cure spell (a spell with &#147;cure&#148; in its name), you can cast it as a swift action, as if using the Quicken Spell feat, by expending two spell slots. This does not increase the level of the spell. You can use this ability once per day at 7th level and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 7th. You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.</p>

				<p>As a standard action, you can transform your body into pure life energy, resembling a golden-white fire elemental. In this form, you gain the elemental subtype and give off a warm, welcoming light that increases the light level within 10 feet by one step, up to normal light. Any undead creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of positive energy damage + 1 point per oracle level. Creatures wielding melee weapons with reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you. If you grapple or attack an undead creature using unarmed strikes or natural weapons, you may deal this damage in place of the normal damage for the attack. Once per round, if you pass through a living allied creature's square or the ally passes through your square, it heals 1d6 hit points + 1 per oracle level. You may use this ability to heal yourself as a move action. You choose whether or not to heal a creature when it passes through your space. You may return to your normal form as a free action. You may remain in energy body form for a number of rounds per day equal to your oracle level.</p>

You may have one bond active per oracle level. This bond continues until the bonded creature dies, you die, the distance between you and the other creature exceeds medium range, or you end it as an immediate action (if you have multiple bonds active, you may end as many as you want as part of the same immediate action).</p>

If the target rolls a natural 20 on an attack roll or saving throw, the attack or saving throw is not an automatic success (as would be normal) and whether it is successful is instead determined normally. Additionally, the target automatically fails all rolls to confirm critical hits. This curse lasts for 1 round per 2 oracle levels you have (minimum 1).

				<p>When the psychic gains this amplification, she chooses two metamagic feats; she need not have these feats to select them. When she casts a spell, she can spend points from her phrenic pool to apply one of the chosen feats to the linked spell without increasing the spell&#146;s level or casting time. She must spend a number of points equal to double the number of levels by which the feat normally increases a spell&#146;s level (minimum 2 points). If the metamagic feat alters the spell&#146;s casting time in a different way than the standard rules for a spontaneous caster using a metamagic feat (as in the case of Quicken Spell), it changes the casting time accordingly. The psychic can still apply metamagic feats she knows to the spell while using this amplification, increasing the casting time and spell level as normal. This amplification can be applied only to a spell that the chosen metamagic feat could normally affect, and only if the spellcaster can cast spells of a high enough level that she would be able to apply the metamagic feat in question to the linked spell. For example, an 11th-level psychic could spend 8 points to quicken a 1st-level spell, but couldn&#146;t quicken a 2nd-level spell because she&#146;s unable to cast 6th-level spells. This ability doesn&#146;t require her to have any free spell slots in the relevant level, however, so the psychic in the example could quicken a 1st-level spell even if she had cast all her 5th-level spells for the day. A psychic can select this amplification multiple times, adding two additional options to the list of metamagic feats she can apply using this amplification each time.</p>

If the target succeeds at its save against the linked spell, it is instead confused for 1 round immediately. For each additional point the psychic spends from her phrenic pool, she can confuse one additional target of the linked spell. This amplification can be applied only to a mind-affecting spell that can affect a number of targets or that has an area. It has no effect on creatures that are immune to mind-affecting effects, unless the linked spell is able to affect such creatures (such as a spell that has both will of the dead and synaptic shock applied to it via dual amplification).</p>

				<p>You can upload your consciousness into a robot, becoming an artificial intelligence. Performing this ascension requires uninterrupted access to a construct with the robot subtype and at least 10 Hit Dice for 24 hours, during which time you cannot perform other tasks. Any interruptions cause the upload to fail. At the end of the 24 hours your consciousness is successfully uploaded into the robot. If the robot is not willing, it must attempt a Will save (DC = 1/2 your psychic level + your Intelligence modifier). If it is successful, the robot rejects your consciousness, rendering you staggered for 24 hours and unable to perform the ritual again during this time.</p>
				<p>If your consciousness is successfully uploaded, the robot&#146;s consciousness is destroyed and your physical body immediately dies and can&#146;t be raised, resurrected, or otherwise brought back to life. Your creature type changes to artificial intelligence, and your robot body gains the aggregate template (Technology Guide 59), with all the adjustments made in the template&#146;s description.</p>
				<p>As a full-round action, you can attempt to upload your consciousness to any other robot within 30 feet that has 10 Hit Dice or more. If the robot is not willing to serve as your vessel, it receives a Will save as above, except if it succeeds, your current robot body is staggered for only 1 minute. If it fails, you move from your current body to the new host body, granting it the aggregate template. Your previous robot body is immediately destroyed by the transference.</p>

This functions as the prayer spell, granting your allies a +1 luck bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saves, and skill checks and imposing a &#150;1 penalty on your enemies&#146; rolls of those types. If you are chaotic, lawful, good, or evil, the penalty from your aura changes to &#150;2 against creatures of an opposing alignment. The penalty doesn&#146;t change further for a creature that opposes you on two alignment axes (such as a chaotic evil creature fighting a lawful good psychic).</p>

				<p>You can heal your own wounds and maladies with the power of thought alone. At 5th level, you gain access to a daily pool of healing energy. This pool starts with 3 d8 dice per day, and gains 1 additional d8 for every 2 psychic levels you possess beyond 5th. As a standard action, you can use up any number of these dice to regain a number of hit points equal to the result of rolling that many d8s. For example, at 5th level you could regain 3d8 hit points all at once, 1d8 hit points three separate times, or 1d8 hit points once and 2d8 hit points at a different time. In addition, you can expend 2 dice from this pool to instead gain the benefit of lesser restoration (affecting yourself only). At 7th level, you can expend 3 dice from this pool to instead gain the benefit of neutralize poison, remove disease, or restoration (affecting yourself only). To use restoration to dispel a permanent negative level, you must expend 4 dice from this pool instead of 3. Use your psychic level as your caster level for these effects.</p>

This link allows you to monitor emotions, detecting when allies become angry, surprised, confused, fearful, or the like, but doesn&#146;t allow them to communicate specific details. You can also easily tell whether a subject is unconscious. If a subject dies or moves to a different plane than you, your bond with that creature is severed. The distance between you and the subjects doesn&#146;t affect the bond as long as you&#146;re on the same plane of existence.

If it enhances your Wisdom, it applies a penalty to your Dexterity. If it enhances your Charisma, it applies a penalty to your Constitution. Otherwise, this ability works just like the alchemist&#146;s mutagen ability (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&#146;s Guide 28). When the effect of the cognatogen ends, you take 2 points of ability damage to the ability score penalized by the cognatogen. If you have both alchemist and psychic levels, these levels stack to determine the duration of your cognatogen and the DC of the save a non-alchemist must attempt if he drinks your cognatogen. If you gain discoveries, you can take the grand cognatogen and greater cognatogen discoveries to improve your cognatogen. The infuse mutagen discovery and the persistent mutagen class ability apply to cognatogens. However, even if you have alchemist levels, the duration of your cognatogen remains 1 minute per level (instead of 10 minutes per level) and you can still create only one per day (instead of an unlimited number) unless you also possess the cognatogen discovery.</p>

You must have at least one piece of cybertech (Technology Guide 35) implanted in you to use this ability.

			<name type="string">Mnemonic Cache</name>
			<text type="formattedtext">
				<p>You can memorize a piece of information and later recall it perfectly. Your mnemonic cache can hold roughly 10 pages of written information, including images and maps, or 30 minutes&#146; worth of speech or music. (Memorizing music doesn&#146;t confer the ability to perform it properly.) The amount you can store increases by 5 pages and 5 minutes at 2nd level, and at every psychic level thereafter. You can hold only one piece of information in your mnemonic cache at a time. The information doesn&#146;t go away when you recall it, but when you put a new piece of information in the cache, the old piece becomes as imperfect any other memory. Memorizing magical writing (such as a scroll or a page from a spellbook) doesn&#146;t confer the ability to borrow, duplicate, or retain any of the magic in the writing. You could reproduce the spell in writing to allow someone who prepares spells from a spellbook to prepare it, though this functions as using a borrowed spellbook for anyone other than you. If you&#146;re in telepathic contact with another creature (through telepathic bond, for example), you can transfer the information directly into its mind as a free action. For this creature, the information functions like a normal memory, not one with perfect clarity.</p>
				<p>You can attempt to sequester a written magical trap (such as explosive runes or sepia snake sigil) in your mnemonic cache and destroy it. Treat this as a Disable Device check to disarm a magical trap (as though you had the trapfinding class feature). Your bonus on this roll is equal to either your Disable Device modifier or the sum of 5 + your psychic level + your Wisdom modifier, whichever is higher. If you succeed, instead of being disabled, the trap is erased and destroyed. This ability can&#146;t destroy symbol traps; it functions only if written text is involved.</p>

				<p>At 5th level, when attempting checks for the automatic writing occult skill unlock (see page 194), you can treat your psychic level + your Wisdom bonus as your number of Linguistics skill ranks. At 8th level, you gain an additional option when using automatic writing, and can attempt a DC 35 check to gain information as though you&#146;d used commune instead of augury or divination. This type of commune requires no material component, and the duration equals 1 round per psychic class level you possess. You connect to a distant being of great intellect, a fragment of the Akashic Record (see page 244), or a similar bastion of knowledge instead of to a deity.</p>

				<p>At 13th level, you mentally construct an extradimensional library to house mental constructs representing the volumes of lore you&#146;ve studied. This ability functions as mage&#146;s magnificent mansion, with the following adjustments: the memory palace is limited in size to a number of 10-foot cubes equal to your psychic level; your memory palace doesn&#146;t contain any furniture other than bookcases and a few desks and sofas where you and your visitors can study; and there is no food within, though the memory palace does contain a number of unseen servants equal to 1/2 your psychic level, which function solely as librarians. The library keeps the same layout each time you summon it, though you can alter its appearance each time you gain a level or by spending 15 minutes concentrating. You can reshape the memory palace in your mind, so it doesn&#146;t need to currently be in effect for you to alter it. You can create your memory palace once per day.</p>
				<p>Choose one type of Knowledge skill when you gain this ability. Consulting your memory palace gives anyone who studies within&#151;including you&#151;a +4 circumstance bonus on Knowledge checks of that type, and the memory palace counts as an extensive library for people attempting Knowledge checks of that type untrained. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on checks with the chosen skill when you&#146;re not consulting the palace (including when the palace isn&#146;t in effect). At 14th level and at each additional level thereafter, choose another Knowledge skill to which your memory palace&#146;s library bonuses apply.</p>

Your mind-affecting spells that deal damage can now be used against haunts and undead normally immune to mind-affecting effects (including mindless undead).

This affects only spells that deal purely psychic-based damage (such as psychic crushOA, mind thrustOA, or synapse overloadOA); effects based on physical effects (such as telekinetic projectileOA or telekinetic stormOA) don&#146;t benefit from this ability. Additional non-damaging effects from such spells don&#146;t affect the haunt, unless it would be normally affected. When you use a mind-affecting effect that deals damage against a possessed creature, the possessing entity takes a &#150;4 penalty on the saving throw against the mind-affecting attack.</p>

				<p>Effect This trap can be added to a supernatural snare trap. The trap briefly imprisons any called creature (such as those called by the planar binding spells) for 1d4 rounds (Will negates). During this time the creature may not move from the location of the trap, though it may still use ranged effects and attack any creature within its reach. Additionally, anchoring traps disable the creature&#146;s ability to t ravel within or between dimensions. This includes casting astral projection, blink, dimension door, dimensional gate, ethereal jaunt, etherealness, gate, maze, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, teleportation circle, and similar spell-like abilities. The trap does not prevent the creature from using magic items that produce these effects, like cubic gates, helms of teleportation, or amulets of the planes. The trap can hold up to a Medium creature; each extra daily use of the ranger&#146;s trap ability spent when the trap is set increases the maximum size of creature the trap can hold by one size category.</p>

Any breathing creature must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (in addition to the Fortitude save for the smoke trap) or be nauseated every round it&#146;s within the smoke and for 1d4+1 rounds after leaving the smoke. If this is an extraordinary trap, the ranger must use a toxic material when setting the trap, such as noxious aromatic (Pathfinder Player Companion: Animal Archive 13).</p>

			<text type="formattedtext">
				<p><b>Effect </b>This pair of traps causes any creature that steps in one of the traps to be teleported to the location of the other trap (Will negates), as the spell dimension door. After having been transported, the creature may not take any other actions until its next turn. If one part of a pair of transpositional traps becomes blocked by a solid body or object, the trap does not function until the obstruction is removed. In order to create this trap, a ranger must set up two transpositional traps within 400 feet of each other, thus expending 2 uses of the ranger&#146;s traps per day. A ranger can only have one pair of transpositional traps set at a time; setting a third transpositional trap immediately causes the first to disappear and keys the second and third transpositional traps to one another.</p>

				<p>Spirit Ability: A shaman who chooses the Ancestors spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability.</p>
				<p><i>Ancestor's Council (Su): </i>As a standard action the shaman can call upon her ancestors to provide advice and assistance to one ally within 30 feet. The ally gains a +2 bonus on any attack roll, saving throw, ability check, or skill check made before the beginning of the shaman&#146;s next turn.

				<p><i>Ancestral Weapon (Su): </i>As a standard action, the shaman can summon an appropriately-sized simple or martial weapon with a +1 enhancement bonus from her family&#146;s history. She is always considered proficient with this weapon. At 15th level and 19th level, the weapon&#146;s enhancement bonus increases by 1. At 11th level, the weapon gains the ghost touch weapon property. The shaman can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her shaman level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. The weapon disappears 1 round after leaving the shaman&#146;s grasp.</p>
				<p><b>True Spirit Ability: </b>A shaman who chooses the Ancestors spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the true version of that spirit.</p>
				<p><i>Ancestral Guardian (Sp): </i>The shaman can call on the ancient allies of her ancestors to physically appear and assist her, even if they have moved on to new roles in the cosmos. Once per day as a standard action, the shaman can cast planar ally. Although there is no cost to use the spelllike ability, the planar ally demands payment for services it performs as normal for the spell.</p>
				<p><b>Manifestation: </b>Upon reaching 20th level, the shaman becomes one with the spirits of her ancestors. She gains a bonus on Will saving throws equal to her Charisma modifier, blindsense out to a range of 60 feet, and a +4 bonus to her caster level for all divination spells. She can cast astral projection as a spell-like ability once per day without requiring material components.</p>

			<name type="string">Dark Tapestry Spirit</name>
			<text type="formattedtext">
				<p>A shaman who selects the Dark Tapestry spirit is often a misanthropic loner. While she may well work with others, she rarely does so of her own volition. Instead, she seeks out the aid of a small group (such as a party of adventurers) as a result of an obscure vision or other influence from the Dark Tapestry that she might not fully comprehend. More often, though, a Dark Tapestry shaman is encountered not as a member of a group, but as the leader of a cult in a remote region&#151;these shamans, of course, work best as NPC villains and not as PCs.</p>
				<p>The spirits of the Dark Tapestry have often been known to whisper dangerous secrets to mortals who dwell on sane worlds. Such spirits might be found anywhere touched by the light of baleful stars, but they are most frequently found lurking around unfathomably ancient ruins of aberrant civilizations with links to the Dark Tapestry. On Golarion, these spirits can often be found near old ruins in Osirion or the Sodden Lands, although they are also quite active throughout the county of Versex in Ustalav. Many shamans who invoke the spirits of the Dark Tapestry also worship one or several of the Outer Gods or Great Old Ones of the Elder Mythos, be it out of fear or misinformed adoration. Other entities associated with the Dark Tapestry, particularly the Dominion of the Black, seem less likely to be associated with that realm&#146;s spirits, so it may well be that the spirits that shamans call upon when they turn to the Dark Tapestry for power are in fact the idle thoughts of horrors such as Nyarlathotep, Yog-Sothoth, or even Azathoth.</p>
				<p><b>Spirit Magic Spells: </b>entropic shield (1st), contact entity IHA (2nd), contact entity IIHA (3rd), black tentacles (4th), contact entity IIIHA (5th), feeblemind (6th), contact entity IVHA (7th), insanity (8th), interplanetary teleportUM (9th).</p>
				<p><b>Hexes: </b>A shaman who chooses the Dark Tapestry spirit can select from the following hexes.</p>

				<p><b>Spirit Animal: </b>The shaman&#146;s spirit animal has an alien physiology, including twitching tentacles, additional but blind eyes, or strangely deformed limbs. The spirit animal gains the shaman&#146;s choice of a swim speed or a climb speed equal to its highest speed, and one of its natural weapons increases in reach by 5 feet. If it did not have a natural weapon, it gains a tentacle attack as a secondary natural weapon with 5-foot reach. Damage for this tentacle is standard for a creature of the spirit animal&#146;s size (1d2 for a Tiny spirit animal, or 1d3 for a Small one).</p>
				<p><b>Spirit Ability: </b>A shaman who chooses the Dark Tapestry spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability.</p>
				<p><i>Touch of the Void (Su): </i>As a standard action, the shaman is able to perform a melee touch attack that deals 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point for every 2 shaman levels she has. At 10th level, any creature the shaman strikes with this touch or with a melee weapon must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be fatigued for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 the shaman&#146;s level. This has no effect on creatures that are already fatigued. The shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.</p>
				<p><b>Greater Spirit Ability: </b>A shaman who chooses the Dark Tapestry spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the greater version of that spirit.</p>
				<p><i>Horrific Glimpse (Sp): </i>Once per day, the shaman can gain the effects of contact other plane after 1 hour of meditation. No components are required in order to use this ability, but the shaman does not get to select which plane she contacts. Instead, this version of the spell contacts an alien mind from somewhere in the Dark Tapestry, be it a hive mind of alien monstrosities, the disembodied sentience of a dead planet, or even the slumbering and insane mind of a Great Old One or Outer God. The shaman must succeed at a DC 16 Wisdom check rather than an Intelligence check to avoid a decrease in Intelligence or Charisma when using this ability. If she fails the check, her Intelligence and Charisma scores each fall to 8 for 5 weeks, as the alien minds thus contacted prove as destructive to mortal thoughts as direct contact with the most powerful of deities. The types of answers provided by the horrific glimpse, be they true answers, ignorance, lies, or random answers, are considered equal to those of a greater deity if the questions being asked concern the Material Plane, but they are equal to those of a demigod if the questions posed concern any other plane.</p>
				<p>Also once per day (but only after first using this ability as per contact other plane), the shaman can reveal a fragment of this horrific vision to another creature, as per &#62;phantasmal killer, except that the target takes 1d4+1 points of Wisdom damage regardless of the results of any of its saving throws. The body of a creature slain by this effect is always hideously mutilated and savaged, making spells like speak with dead useless.</p>
				<p><b>True Spirit Ability: </b>A shaman who chooses the Dark Tapestry spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the true version of that spirit.</p>
				<p><i>Unbound Form (Su): </i>The shaman can assume a variety of forms, as per greater polymorph, for 1 minute per day per shaman level. The minutes need not be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments. When she assumes these forms, some element of the new shape always sets it apart from a typical specimen, such as strangely colored eyes, limbs that bend in unusual ways, or a slimy coating of mucus over the flesh.</p>
				<p><b>Manifestation: </b>Upon reaching 20th level, the shaman becomes an unnatural spirit of the Dark Tapestry. She gains damage reduction 5/&#151; and immunity to acid, critical hits, and sneak attacks. While she retains much of her original appearance, several minor cosmetic changes leave no doubt as to her now-alien nature. Her eyes might appear as solid spheres of blackness, her fingers might writhe like tentacles, or her legs might bend backward at the knees.</p>
				<p>Once per day, the shaman can cast shapechange as a spell-like ability without requiring a material component, but the form the shaman assumes via this spell-like ability is never something that looks of natural origin to the shaman&#146;s home world.</p>

The target can attempt a Will save to negate the effect and immediately know the source of this harmful mental prying. Creatures that fail their saving throws are racked with pain, taking 1d6 points of damage for every 2 shaman levels the shaman has. After successfully damaging a creature with this ability, the shaman can sort through the jumble of stolen thoughts and memories as a fullround action and then attempt a single Knowledge check using the victim&#146;s skill bonus rather than her own. If the victim wasn&#146;t trained in the Knowledge skill the shaman wishes to use, then this check must be attempted as if untrained as well. The randomly stolen thoughts remain in the shaman&#146;s mind for a number of rounds equal to her Wisdom modifier, and the shaman can attempt one Knowledge check per round using these drained thoughts. This ability does not give access to memories or other personal information known by the victim. Brain drain is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
				<p>The shaman can use this ability once per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day at 5th level and for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum of five times per day at 20th level.</p>

				<p>At will as a standard action, the shaman can invoke whispers from spirits of the Dark Tapestry to speak directly into the mind of a single target within 30 feet. These whispers utilize no known language, yet the victim nevertheless feels convinced that, somehow, it was almost able to comprehend the message. The target must succeed at a Will saving throw or be confused for 1 round. At 8th level and again at 16th level, the confusion caused by this hex lasts for 1 additional round. Whether or not the save is successful, the shaman cannot target that creature with this hex again for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>

				<p><b>Spirit Ability: </b>A shaman who chooses the Lore spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability.</p>
				<p><i>Monstrous Insight (Su): </i>The shaman can identify creatures and gain insight into their strengths and weaknesses. As a standard action, the shaman can attempt a Knowledge skill check to identify a creature and its abilities (using the appropriate skill for the monster&#146;s type) with an insight bonus equal to her shaman level. Whether or not the check is successful, she also gains a +2 insight bonus for 1 minute on attack rolls made against that creature and a +2 insight bonus to her AC against attacks made by that creature.

				<p><i>Automatic Writing (Su): </i>Once per day, the shaman can spend 10 minutes in uninterrupted meditation to tap into greater understanding. During this period, her hands produce mysterious writings pertaining to the future. This writing takes the form of divination with 90% effectiveness. The shaman can use this ability an additional time per day at 12th, 16th, and 20th levels.</p>

				<p><b>Manifestation: </b>Upon reaching 20th level, the shaman becomes an unending font of knowledge and lore. She can take 20 on all Knowledge skill checks, including those she isn&#146;t trained in. Her understanding of the fundamental underpinnings of reality has also become so advanced that she can cast wish once per day. This doesn&#146;t require a material component, but the wish cannot be used to grant ability score bonuses or replicate spells with expensive material components.</p>

				<p>The shaman&#146;s native intelligence grants her the ability to tap into arcane lore. The shaman can add a number of spells from the sorcerer/wizard spell list equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1) to the list of shaman spells she can prepare. To cast these spells she must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level, but the saving throw DCs of these spells are based on her Wisdom rather than Intelligence. When she casts these spells, they are treated as divine rather than arcane. Each time the shaman gains a level after taking this hex, she can choose to replace one of these spells for a new spell on the wizard/sorcerer spell list.</p>

				<p>As a standard action, the shaman violently probes the mind of a single intelligent enemy within 30 feet. The target can attempt a Will saving throw to negate the effect. If it succeeds, it immediately knows the source of the mental prying; otherwise, it&#146;s wracked with pain and takes 1d4 points of damage for every 2 levels the shaman possesses. On the round following her successful use of this ability, the shaman can take a fullround action to sort through the jumble of stolen thoughts and memories to attempt a single Knowledge check using the victim&#146;s bonus with that skill. The random stolen thoughts remain in the shaman&#146;s mind for a number of rounds equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1), and she can treat the knowledge gained as if she used detect thoughts. This is a mind-affecting effect. Once she successfully affects a creature, she cannot use this hex on that creature again for 24 hours.</p>

				<p><b>Spirit Animal: </b>The shaman&#146;s spirit animal appears more primal and prehistoric than an ordinary animal of its kind. It gains a +2 inherent bonus to its Strength score. The spirit animal loses this bonus when it manifests as a megafauna companion from the true spirit ability (see page 133).</p>
				<p><b>Spirit Ability: </b>A shaman who chooses the Mammoth spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability.</p>
				<p><i>Powerful Smash (Ex): </i>As a standard action, the shaman can attack an enemy with an unarmed strike as if she had the Improved Unarmed Strike feat. If the shaman hits a creature in this way, that creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the shaman&#146;s class level + her Charisma modifier) or be dazed for 1 round.

				<p><i>Megafauna Companion (Su): </i>The shaman&#146;s spirit animal transforms into a megafauna animal companion, using the shaman&#146;s shaman level as her effective druid level. The shaman must choose an arsinoitheriumB2, baluchitheriumB3, brontotheriumB6, chalicotheriumB5, deinotheriumB6, elasmotheriumB6, glyptodonB2, mastodon, megalocerosB2, megatheriumB2, uintatheriumB5, or another mammalian megafauna (including most dire animals) that has animal companion statistics. It retains its Intelligence score and the special abilities it gains from the spirit animal class feature, but it also has the statistics and abilities of an animal companion. If the animal companion is dismissed, lost, or dies, it can be replaced in the same way as a normal spirit animal.</p>
				<p><b>Manifestation: </b>At 20th level, the shaman can transform into any animal listed under the megafauna or elephant heading. This ability works as per beast shape IV, but the shaman can activate and dismiss the ability as often as she likes and the duration is permanent.</p>

The creature takes no damage from the ability, but takes a &#150;4 penalty to its CMD against bull rush, overrun, and trip attempts. Additionally, spellcasters under the effect of this ability take a &#150;4 penalty on concentration checks. The target receives no saving throw to negate this effect.

				<p><b>Spirit Animal: </b>The shaman&#146;s spirit animal looks feral, and appears to be in peak physical form. The animal can move through any sort of undergrowth or natural difficult terrain at its normal speed without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. If the animal has a fly speed, it can ignore the penalty on Fly skill checks for winds up to windstorm strength (see page 439 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
				<p><b>Spirit Ability: </b>A shaman who chooses the Nature spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability.</p>
				<p><i>Storm Burst (Su): </i>As a standard action, the shaman causes a small storm of swirling wind and rain to form around one creature within 30 feet. This storm causes the target to treat all foes as if they had concealment, suffering a 20% miss chance for 1 round plus 1 round for every 4 shaman levels she possesses. The shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. At 11th level, any weapon she wields is treated as a thundering weapon.</p>

The animal retains all the special abilities and the Intelligence score of the spirit animal, but also has the statistics and abilities of an animal companion. If the animal is dismissed, is lost, or dies, it can be replaced in the same way as a normal spirit animal.</p>
				<p><b>Manifestation: </b>Upon reaching 20th level, the shaman becomes a spirit of nature. Once per day, she can surround herself with an organic cocoon of silk as a full-round action. While enclosed in the cocoon, she&#146;s considered helpless. Eight hours later, she emerges, having changed her type to plant, animal, or humanoid, and having gained superficial physical characteristics of the chosen type as appropriate (see Pathfinder RPG Bestiary). She must choose a type that is different from her current type. This effect change doesn&#146;t alter her Hit Dice, hit points, saving throws, skill ranks, class skills, or prof iciencies. The effect is permanent, until the shaman chooses to transform again. Each time the transformation is made, the shaman is cleansed of all poisons or diseases, restored to full hit points, and healed of all ability damage.</p>

To attempt to assassinate a target, the slayer must first study his target for 1 round as a standard action. On the following round, if the slayer makes a sneak attack against the target and that target is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, the sneak attack has the additional effect of possibly killing the target. This attempt automatically fails if the target recognizes the slayer as an enemy. If the sneak attack is successful, the target must attempt a Fortitude saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the slayer&#146;s level + the slayer&#146;s Intelligence modifier. If the target fails this save, it dies; otherwise, the target takes the sneak attack damage as normal and is then immune to that slayer&#146;s assassinate ability for 24 hours.</p>

				<p>Possessed sorcerers channel their magic potential through a unique bond with a possessing spirit rather than through blood alone. These spirits take numerous forms, but such is their tenaciousness that they bond in a way that prevents their banishment from the host. Instead, both possessor and sorcerer work together, their joint nature allowing the sorcerer to unlock many unnatural abilities. Outsider-rich nations such as Cheliax and the Worldwound are common places for possessed sorcerers to appear, though anyplace where an outsider could possess another living being would be equally suitable. The magical nature of a sorcerer&#146;s bloodline means the sorcerer herself does not even need to be the creature initially possessed to have this particular bloodline. It may be that one of your ancestors was possessed by a powerful spirit, one whose presence was so overwhelming that it sends ripples of power down through the generations.</p>

You can switch between your forms at will, and can assume your giant form for as long as you want. In addition, you gain SR equal to 6 + your sorcerer level, and whenever you cast a spell of the charm or compulsion subschool, the spell&#146;s DC increases by +2.</p>

				<p>At 1st level as a free action, you can cause nanites to flow from your body and coat the striking end of any manufactured melee weapon you wield. When you hit with a melee attack using this weapon, some of the nanites infect the blood of the victim (Poison&#151;injury; save Fort DC 10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level + your Con modifier; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1 Str damage; cure 1 save). At 5th level, weapons you use with this ability are treated as magical for the purposes of overcoming DR, and the poison also deals 1 point of Constitution damage. At 7th level, the damage increases to 1d2 points of Constitution damage and 1d2 points of Strength damage. At 11th level, the cure becomes two successful saves. You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier; these rounds need not be consecutive.</p>

At 17th level, you can use this ability twice per day (though using this ability twice in one 24-hour period entails a chance of system shock and death; see the spell&#146;s description for more details).

				<h>Expanded Bloodlines</h>
				<p>Source Dragons of Legacy pg. 4</p>
				<p>Chromatic and metallic dragons remain the most common dragons to impart their legacy onto other species. The bloodrager and sorcerer classes each include a draconic bloodline that assumes the character&#146;s lineage is somehow connected with the power of a chromatic or metallic dragon. Presented below are expanded options for the existing draconic bloodlines, increasing the selection of heritages to include the numerous new true dragons presented in the many Pathfinder RPG Bestiary volumes. Each of the draconic bloodlines below alters the bloodrager&#146;s or sorcerer&#146;s bloodline arcana.</p>
				<p><b>Energy Types: </b>Several of these new draconic bloodline options include nonstandard damage types. For the sake of game balance, many of the damage types available to the bloodlines below somewhat differ from those produced by the parent dragon. Specifically, force energy, negative energy, and sonic energy have been altered to different types of energy. In cases where a dragon&#146;s energy type is listed as physical damage (such as bludgeoning or piercing), use that damage type when determining your breath weapon damage. For the purpose of the dragon resistance bloodline power, you gain DR equal to half the energy resistance you would normally gain against all attacks of that specific damage type. A character with the power of wyrms bloodline power gains immunity to her bloodline&#146;s damage type. For all other purposes, such as archetypes, bloodline powers, and feats, treat that dragon&#146;s energy type as fire.</p>
				<h>Esoteric Dragons</h>
				<p>Though many of the enigmatic esoteric dragons remain aloof or intentionally distant from mortal affairs, occult dragons are the most likely to imprint their bloodline onto humanoids. Often such draconic blood is the result of ongoing experimentation. Scions of other esoteric dragons are far more unusual; such bloodlines usually result from explorers traveling the realms where these distant dragons dwell and being exposed to some spectacular and illunderstood power.</p>
				<p><b>Variant Bloodline Arcana: </b>When selecting spells known, you can choose spells from the psychic class spell list (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 69). The psychic spells you select must normally be unavailable to your class. You can know only a number of psychic spells equal to the highest level spell you can cast from your class spell list, based on your current class level. When you&#146;re casting these spells, they function as psychic magic instead of arcane. You use thought and emotion components (Occult Adventures 144) instead of verbal and somatic components when casting these spells.</p>

				<h>Imperial Dragons</h>
				<p>The blood of imperial dragons is well known throughout the lands of Tian Xia, where such dragons form a strong part of much of the continent&#146;s mythology. This is particularly true in Xa Hoi, where imperial dragons rule. Imperial dragons in other lands may vary in their interactions with humanoids, but universally accept the praise (and fear) of those around them. Their connection to the land makes the blood of these dragons a powerful arcane catalyst in the making of heroes.</p>
				<p><b>Variant Bloodline Arcana: </b>Whenever you cast a spell that affects a creature with the shaken, frightened, or panicked condition, increase the spell&#146;s save DC by 1.</p>

				<h>Outer Dragons</h>
				<p>The interests of outer dragons take them across the cosmos. Strange devices or experimentation are most likely to lead to the addition of outer dragon blood into a world&#146;s ecosystem. The hidden blood of an outer dragon in a family&#146;s lineage is difficult to detect or stamp out. On Golarion, these dragons most commonly find themselves drawn to the fabled land of Numeria and its alien technology, though they usually refuse to share any of their insights with that nation&#146;s residents.</p>
				<p><b>Variant Bloodline </b>Arcana: Whenever you cast a spell with an energy descriptor that matches your draconic bloodline&#146;s energy type, if a creature is damaged by the spell, that creature cannot take a 5-foot step for 1 round. This effect occurs only when you&#146;re using spells that require an attack roll (such as chill touch or scorching ray) or spells that allow a save (such as fireball or lightning bolt). A successful save against the damage or effects of the spell also negates this additional effect.</p>

				<h>Primal Dragons</h>
				<p>Born from the elemental planes or the Shadow Plane, primal dragons are infused with primeval power. These dragons traveled to the Material Plane in ages past, and many of their kind continue to spread their blood and magical influence among the humanoid races of the world. Even the malign umbral dragons prosper in the caverns of the Darklands and the mountains of Nidal. Any exposure to or experimentation with primal magics may introduce primal dragon blood into a lineage.</p>
				<p><b>Variant Bloodline Arcana: </b>Whenever you cast a spell with an energy descriptor that matches your draconic bloodline&#146;s energy type, you can reroll a number of damage dice equal to half the spell&#146;s level.</p>

				<p>At 9th level, you gain the ability to instantly recover from most harmful effects by temporarily aging yourself decades in a matter of moments. As a standard action, you can shift your effective age to the next highest aging step (for example, from adulthood to middle age). Each time you do this, any debilitating condition or effect currently affecting you that initially allowed a Will or Fortitude saving throw immediately ends. When you age yourself in this way, you take the normal penalties associated with growing older (see page 169 of the Core Rulebook) but gain none of the benefits. You cannot use this power to age beyond venerable, recover hit point damage, or remove effects that did not or do not allow a Will or Fortitude saving throw to negate. You return to your actual age 24 hours after the last time you used this ability, and all penalties to ability scores as a result of advanced age are then removed.</p>

This attack causes the target to take 1 additional point of damage each round for each die of the rogue's sneak attack (e.g., 4d6 equals 4 points of bleed). Bleeding creatures take that amount of damage every round at the start of each of their turns. The bleeding can be stopped by a DC 15 Heal check or the application of any effect that heals hit point damage. Bleeding damage from this ability does not stack with itself.

				<p>The first time each round that you deal sneak attack damage to an opponent, you can forgo sneak attack damage to distract the creature. The target must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + the number of sneak attack dice sacrificed + your Charisma modifier) or become distracted until the start of your next turn. Distracted opponents are entirely focused on you, and pay little attention to their surroundings; they are not considered to be observing other characters within 30 feet, allowing them to attempt Stealth checks to hide. A distracted opponent automatically fails Perception checks against creatures more than 30 feet away.</p>

If she does so, the spellcaster does not learn that she succeeded at her saving throw, even if she was the only target, though she must succeed at an opposed Bluff check against a spellcaster&#146;s Sense Motive check to determine whether she is under the enchantment&#146;s effects. While this ruse is in place, the spellcaster is flat-footed against the rogue&#146;s first attack.

				<p>As a full-round action, the rogue can move up to her speed. If she successfully reaches a location that offers her cover or concealment, any creature observing her must attempt a Perception check opposed by the rogue&#146;s Stealth check. On a failed check, the observer loses track of the rogue and fails to note where she moved to. The rogue does not take a penalty on this Stealth check for moving up to her speed. At the end of her movement, the rogue can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize all foes within 60 feet who were aware of her at any point during her movement and are unaware of her current location. She rolls the Intimidate check only once and compares her result to the DC for each opponent. The rogue must be at least 6th level to select this talent.</p>

				<p>Survival in the Mana Wastes between the nations of Nex and Geb can depend heavily on locating sufficient magical equipment, which sometimes involves stealing power from a wand or scroll to power a more necessary one. As a full-round action, a rogue with this talent can use two potions, two wands, or two scrolls. Each item is expended or loses a charge as if used normally. The rogue chooses to gain the magical effect of one, but calculates its effects using the caster level of the other. The rogue must still succeed at a Use Magic Device check to operate scrolls or wands unless some other ability allows him to do so, but makes only one skill check to operate both items.</p>

				<p>A rogue with this talent is familiar enough with enchantment magic to fool it, using spellcasters&#146; complacency to set them up for a surprise attack. Whenever she succeeds at a saving throw against an enchantment effect, the rogue learns the spell&#146;s effect on a failed save, allowing her to play along and pretend to have failed her save. If she does so, the spellcaster does not learn that she succeeded at her saving throw, even if she was the only target, though she must succeed at an opposed Bluff check against a spellcaster&#146;s Sense Motive check to determine whether she is under the enchantment&#146;s effects. While this ruse is in place, the spellcaster is flat-footed against the rogue&#146;s first attack. If the spellcaster sees the rogue perform (or fail to perform) an action that would be impossible if she were under the enchantment&#146;s effect, he automatically discovers her ruse.</p>

The rogue needs to learn only the approximate appearance of a document that doesn&#146;t require a particular person&#146;s signature to accurately forge the document with Linguistics (gaining a +8 bonus on the check to create the forgery, as if she had seen a similar document before). The rogue needs only a small sample of a person&#146;s handwriting to make a convincing forgery of great length in that person&#146;s handwriting. The rogue can always take 10 on Diplomacy checks to offer bribes. In addition, the rogue automatically gains an extra advantage at the start of a pursuit (Ultimate Intrigue 142) in an urban environment.</p>

This functions as the spell color spray, except that creatures with fewer HD than the phantom are treated as if they had 2 HD or less, creatures with HD equal to that of the phantom are treated as if they had 3 or 4 HD, and creatures with more HD than the phantom are treated as if they had 5 or more HD. A creature can negate this effect with a successful Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half the phantom&#146;s Hit Dice + the phantom&#146;s Charisma modifier).</p>
				<p><b>Aura of Laughter (Sp): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 7th level, the phantom can emit a 10-foot aura of childish laughter as a swift action. Enemies within the aura are distracted by the laughter, taking a &#150;2 penalty on attack and damage rolls and a &#150;5 penalty on Perception checks. This ability has no effect on creatures that cannot hear.</p>
				<p><b>Telekinetic Prankster (Sp): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 12th level, the phantom gains the ability to use limited telekinesis to trip up its foes. It can perform combat maneuvers against creatures up to 15 feet away. When doing so, it can use its Charisma modifier in place of its Strength modifier on its combat maneuver checks.</p>
				<p><b>Invoke Laughter (Sp): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 17th level, once per day as a standard action, the phantom can cause nearby creatures to fall into fits of uncontrollable laughter. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius burst centered on the phantom must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half the phantom&#146;s Hit Dice + the phantom&#146;s Charisma modifier) or begin laughing uncontrollably, as the spell hideous laughter. The phantom can use this ability in either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form.</p>
				<h>Other Whimsy-Focused Abilities</h>
				<p>If a spiritualist archetype allows the selection of an additional focus, add whimsy to the list of available foci. In addition, a bloodrager with the id rager archetype can select whimsy as his emotional focus. Add the following to the other character options found in Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures for spiritualists with whimsy phantoms.</p>
				<p><b>Emotional Conduit (Feat): </b>1st&#151;color spray, 2nd&#151;hideous laughter, 3rd&#151;major image, 4th&#151;hallucinatory terrain, 5th&#151;baleful polymorph, 6th&#151;mislead.</p>
				<p><b>Fractured Mind (Archetype): </b>ventriloquism (5th), absurdity (7th), major image (9th), rainbow pattern (16th).</p>

			<name type="string">Suffering</name>
			<text type="formattedtext">
				<p>Phantoms with this focus stand on trembling legs, with hands quivering and tears constantly streaming from their eyes. Their auras are typically a blue or purple, but the phantoms have vividly glowing scars and bruises that pulse and throb with their motion. When addressed, they tend to respond with only slight nods and other subtle gestures, rarely speaking beyond soft-spoken apologies and self-recriminations.</p>
				<p>While clearly in a state of constant pain, they show no concern for their own well-being, focusing entirely on protecting their masters and their masters&#146; allies. Each time one of these phantoms uses its abilities to protect its allies from harm, new injuries manifest visibly upon it, which these phantoms wear like badges of honor.</p>
				<p><b>Skills: </b>The phantom gains a number of ranks in Climb and Heal equal to its number of Hit Dice. When confined in the spiritualist&#146;s consciousness, the phantom grants the spiritualist Skill Focus in each of these skills.</p>
				<p><b>Good Saves: </b>Fortitude and Will.</p>
				<p><b>Endurance: </b>The phantom gains Endurance as a bonus feat. Furthermore, when the phantom is confined in its master&#146;s consciousness, it grants the benefits of Endurance to its master if its master doesn&#146;t have that feat.</p>
				<p><b>Repelling Strike (Ex): </b>When the phantom deals damage with a melee attack, it can attempt to bull rush the target as a swift action without provoking attacks of opportunity, using the result of its attack roll for the combat maneuver check. The phantom can push a creature back only 5 feet with this ability, regardless of the result of its combat maneuver check.</p>
				<p><b>Numbing Aura (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 7th level, as a swift action, the phantom can emit a 20-foot aura of protection. Allies within this aura gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against curse, disease, evil, fear, pain, and poison effects (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 137&#150;138). Deactivating the aura is a free action. The phantom can use this ability in either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form.</p>
				<p><b>Suffer in Stead (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 12th level, as an immediate action when her phantom is fully manifested and within 30 feet of her, she can transfer any of the following conditions to the phantom that would afflict her: blinded, deafened, exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, paralyzed, sickened, staggered, or stunned. The spiritualist must choose to do this before the condition&#146;s duration begins. The spiritualist can&#146;t use this ability if any of the listed conditions are already affecting the phantom. Using this ability does not affect the duration of the transferred condition; it simply makes the condition affect the phantom instead of the spiritualist.</p>
				<p>When the spiritualist reaches 18th level, as an immediate action when fully manifested, the phantom can use this ability to transfer any of the listed conditions to itself when the condition would afflict any ally within 30 feet. Using the ability in this way requires no additional action from the spiritualist.</p>
				<p><b>Willing Martyr (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 17th level, the phantom begins to anticipate when the spiritualist or her allies would fall into grave bodily danger and can take those wounds itself. Whenever the phantom is fully manifested and the spiritualist or an ally is reduced to one-quarter or fewer hit points, as long as the phantom is within 30 feet, it must take any hit point damage or ability score damage in place of the injured spiritualist or ally. This hit point damage or ability score damage bypasses the phantom&#146;s defensive abilities (although it is still subject to the defensive abilities of the originally targeted spiritualist or ally) and afflicts the phantom as it would the spiritualist or ally. After the phantom becomes the target of one attack or effect in place of the injured spiritualist or ally, the spiritualist can command the phantom to suppress this ability as a free action. Reactivating this ability is a swift action.</p>

			<name type="string">Remorse</name>
			<text type="formattedtext">
				<p>Spirits of creatures that died with heavy weights upon their consciences manifest with the remorse emotional focus. These phantoms, whose forms are often darkened by shadows, force foes to experience their regret and self-loathing. A spiritualist with the fated guide archetype (see page 18) must choose remorse as her phantom&#146;s emotional focus, but other spiritualists can also select this emotional focus for their phantoms.</p>
				<p><b>Skills: </b>The phantom gains a number of ranks in Perception and Sense Motive equal to its Hit Dice. While confined in the spiritualist&#146;s consciousness, the phantom grants the spiritualist Skill Focus in each of these skills.</p>
				<p><b>Good Saves: </b>Fortitude and Will.</p>
				<p><b>Antagonistic: </b>The phantom gains Antagonize as a bonus feat.</p>
				<p><b>Long-Suffering Strike (Su): </b>When a phantom with this focus hits a creature with its slam attack, that creature must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the phantom&#146;s Hit Dice + the phantom&#146;s Charisma modifier) or any attacks targeting the creature gain a +1 bonus on their attack rolls and damage rolls until the beginning of the phantom&#146;s next turn. Penalties from multiple hits don&#146;t stack with themselves.</p>
				<p><b>Aura of Regret (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 7th level, her phantom can emit a 10-foot-radius aura of regret as a swift action. Enemies within the aura take a &#150;2 penalty on skill checks, on caster level checks, on combat maneuver checks, and to CMD. Ending the aura is a free action. The phantom can use this ability in either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form.</p>
				<p><b>Keening (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 12th level, her phantom can wail about its misdeeds once per day as a standard action, affecting all creatures within a 30-foot cone with the terrible remorseUM spell. The phantom uses its Hit Dice as its caster level for the effect, and the DC equals 10 + 1/2 the phantom&#146;s Hit Dice + the phantom&#146;s Charisma modifier. The phantom can use this ability in either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form.</p>
				<p><b>Utter Misery (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 17th level, her phantom&#146;s long-suffering strike also causes a creature that fails its save to become stunned until the beginning of the phantom&#146;s next turn.</p>
				<h>Other Remorse-Focused Abilities</h>
				<p>If a spiritualist archetype allows the selection of an additional focus, add remorse to the list of available foci. Add the following to other character options for spiritualists with remorse phantoms.</p>
				<p><b>Emotional Conduit (Feat): </b>1st-inflict light wounds, 2nd-disfiguring touchUM, 3rd-howling agonyUM, 4th-debilitating portentUC, 5th-nightmare, 6th-harm.</p>

			<name type="string">Pride</name>
			<text type="formattedtext">
				<p>No phantom is as arrogant as a pride phantom, which in life was an insufferable braggart and egotist. These phantoms often puff and posture while fighting, shouting brash taunts and paeans to their own supposed skill in all things. Pride phantoms are often a roiling green in color.</p>
				<p><b>Skills: </b>The phantom gains a number of ranks in Intimidate and in Perception equal to its number of Hit Dice. While the phantom is confined within the spiritualist&#146;s consciousness, the phantom grants the spiritualist Skill Focus in each of these skills.</p>
				<p><b>Good Saves: </b>Reflex and Will.</p>
				<p><b>Resolve: </b>A phantom that has this emotional focus is immune to fear effects. However, when the phantom fails an ability check, skill check, or attack roll, it loses this immunity for 1 hour. Multiple failed checks or rolls are not cumulative. Instead, they simply reset the hour of lost immunity.</p>
				<p><b>Flagrant Disregard (Ex): </b>As a swift action, the phantom can gain a +2 bonus on all attack rolls while taking a &#150;1 penalty to AC for 1 round. For every 4 points of base attack bonus the phantom has, this bonus on attack rolls increases by 1 and the penalty to AC increases by 1.</p>
				<p><b>Vainglorious Oration (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 7th level, the phantom can espouse bold lies about its own prowess as a swift action to cause enemies to become shaken. To be affected, an enemy must be within 30 feet of the phantom and able to hear it. This effect persists as long as the enemy is within 30 feet (the phantom can end the oration as a free action). This ability cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the target was already shaken from another effect. This is a mind-affecting fear effect that relies on audible components.</p>
				<p><b>Overwhelming Confidence (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 12th level, as long as the phantom is immune to fear effects from its resolve ability, any morale bonuses affecting the phantom are doubled. If the phantom loses its immunity to fear, all doubled morale bonuses that are affecting the phantom are instead applied as penalties for the remainder of their duration or until the phantom regains its immunity to fear (whichever comes first).</p>
				<p><b>Illusion of Perfection (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 17th level, the greed phantom can shroud itself in an illusion as a swift action, appearing as a model of absolute physical perfection&#151;its idealized image of itself. The phantom gains a bonus on melee damage rolls equal to its Charisma modifier. However, whenever the phantom deals damage to a creature, the creature can attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the phantom&#146;s Hit Dice + the phantom&#146;s Charisma modifier) to disbelieve the effect, reducing the bonus on damage rolls by half if successful. The phantom can use illusion of perfection for a number of minutes per day equal to its Hit Dice. This duration need not be used all at once, but must be expended in 1-minute intervals. This ability is a mind-affecting illusion effect.</p>

			<name type="string">Lust</name>
			<text type="formattedtext">
				<p>A phantom with this focus aches for the intoxicating pleasures it experienced during life. These phantoms often writhe sensuously and whisper promises of unadulterated bliss to those they fight. Lust phantoms are typically deep rose in color, and they sometimes emit musky, exotic scents when they move.</p>
				<p><b>Skills: </b>The phantom gains a number of ranks in Bluff and Diplomacy equal to its number of Hit Dice. While confined in the spiritualist&#146;s consciousness, the phantom grants the spiritualist Skill Focus in each of these skills.</p>
				<p><b>Good Saves: </b>Fortitude and Will.</p>
				<p><b>Constitution Focus: </b>A phantom with this focus gains a +2 bonus to Constitution and a &#150;2 penalty to Dexterity. Instead of gaining a bonus to Dexterity as the spiritualist gains levels, a lust-focused phantom gains a bonus to Constitution instead.</p>
				<p><b>Alluring Presence (Su): </b>A phantom with this focus can coerce enemies to attack it. As an immediate action, the phantom attempts a Diplomacy check against a creature targeting the spiritualist with an attack or harmful spell, provided the phantom is within the target creature&#146;s reach (or range, if the creature is attacking with a ranged weapon or spell). The DC for this check equals 10 + 1/2 the attacking creature&#146;s HD + the attacking creature&#146;s Wisdom modifier. If successful, the phantom becomes the target of all the creature&#146;s attacks for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting compulsion emotionUM effect.</p>
				<p><b>Mine Alone (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 7th level, whenever the spiritualist or the phantom is subject to a charm or compulsion effect, the target of the effect can roll twice for its save&#151;once using the spiritualist&#146;s Will save modifier and once using the phantom&#146;s&#151;and take the better result.</p>
				<p><b>Aura of Ecstasy (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 12th level, the lust phantom emanates an aura of ecstasy. All creatures adjacent to the phantom must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the phantom&#146;s Hit Dice + the phantom&#146;s Charisma modifier) or be shaken and staggered each round that they remain within the aura of ecstasy. Creatures that succeed at this save are immune to this phantom&#146;s aura of ecstasy for 24 hours.</p>
				<p><b>Sinful Command (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 17th level, once per day as a standard action, the phantom can attempt to assume control of another creature&#146;s mind as per the dominate monster spell. The DC of the effect is equal to 10 + 1/2 the phantom&#146;s Hit Dice + the phantom&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>

			<text type="formattedtext">
				<p>A phantom with this emotional focus was a being with a generous heart in life and continues to remain that way well after death. The phantom&#146;s intense generosity compels it to remain a phantom and continue assisting the living, especially relatives or those who had been its good friends during its living years. Kindness phantoms have pleasant and gentle demeanors and speak with a melodic cadence, putting most who see them at ease. Their auras are bright emerald green with occasional fluctuating scarlet or golden hues.</p>
				<p><b>Skills: </b>The phantom gains a number of ranks in Diplomacy and Heal equal to its number of Hit Dice. While confined in the spiritualist&#146;s consciousness, the phantom grants the spiritualist Skill Focus in each of these skills.</p>
				<p><b>Good Saves: </b>Fortitude and Will.</p>
				<p><b>Benevolent: </b>When the phantom uses the aid another action, the bonus granted by a successful check increases by 1. If the phantom aids the spiritualist this way, the bonus instead increases by 2.</p>
				<p><b>Opening Strike (Su): </b>As a standard action, the phantom can make a melee attack against a foe. If this attack hits, the spiritualist designates one ally threatening that enemy. This ally can make a single attack at his full base attack bonus against that enemy as an immediate action.</p>
				<p><b>Etheric Healing (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 7th level, the phantom gains the lay on hands ability with an effective paladin level equal to its Hit Dice. The phantom can use this ability on the spiritualist as a swift action.</p>
				<p><b>Expanded Aid (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 12th level, the phantom can use the aid another action as a move action. Additionally, the phantom selects four mercies available to a 12th-level paladin that it adds to its lay on hands ability.</p>
				<p><b>Exceptional Aid (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 17th level, the phantom can use the aid another action as a swift action. Additionally, when designating an ally for an opening strike, that ally gains a bonus equal to the phantom&#146;s Charisma modifier on damage rolls for the attack granted to him.</p>
				<h>Other Kindess-Focused Abilities</h>
				<p>If a spiritualist archetype allows the selection of an additional focus, add kindness to the list of available foci. In addition, a bloodrager with the id rager archetype (Pathfinder Player Companion: Occult Origins 23) can select kindness as his emotional focus.

			<text type="formattedtext">
				<p>A phantom with this emotional focus is covetous of everything&#151;its master, those who wish to do it harm, and any who do not pay attention to it. It demands to be the center of attention at all times. The forms these phantoms take are as diverse as the forms of jealousy in life. Often they take pleasing forms, wishing to draw others in. Other times they take the form of crawling and lurching things, grasping at all they covet when they come within reach. The auras of these needy phantoms quickly change in color, going from an oily green to orange, to brownish red as they swirl through emotions in their efforts to gain the objects of their dark desires.</p>
				<p><b>Skills: </b>The phantom gains a number of ranks in Appraise and Bluff equal to its number of Hit Dice. While confined in the spiritualist&#146;s consciousness, the phantom grants the spiritualist Skill Focus in each of these skills.</p>
				<p><b>Good Saves: </b>Reflex and Will.</p>
				<p><b>Deceitful: </b>The phantom gains Deceitful as a bonus feat.</p>
				<p><b>Jealous Combatant (Su): </b>Each time the phantom hits a creature with a melee attack, for 1 round that creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on all attack rolls made against anyone other than the phantom. This effect does not stack with itself.</p>
				<p><b>Resentful Aura (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 7th level, as a swift action, the phantom can emit a 20-foot-radius aura that forces enemies within the aura who make an attack or cast a spell that does not include the phantom in its effect to succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the phantom&#146;s Hit Dice + the phantom&#146;s Charisma modifier) or become staggered until the end of the enemy&#146;s next turn. Ending the aura is a free action. The phantom can use this ability in either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form.</p>
				<p><b>Retribution (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 12th level, each time a creature attacks the phantom&#146;s master, whether that attack hits or misses, it enrages the phantom. Until the end of the phantom&#146;s next turn, any attack the phantom makes that hits the creature that has attacked her deals 2d8 extra points of damage. This extra damage is precision damage.</p>
				<p><b>Mine to Take (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 17th level, once per day as an immediate action, just before the phantom&#146;s master is about to attempt a saving throw or be targeted by an attack roll, the phantom and the spiritualist can swap places as long as both are on the same plane and the phantom is aware of the attack or effect. After the swap occurs, the phantom is targeted by the attack or effect that triggered this ability, though the phantom may be immune or resistant to the effect. This is a teleportation effect. The phantom can use this ability in either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form.</p>

			<name type="string">Hatred</name>
			<text type="formattedtext">
				<p>Few things draw a spirit toward the Negative Material Plane like the emotion of hatred. Phantoms with this focus often are blinded by&#151;and blind others with&#151;this powerful emotion. These phantoms are frequently darker and more foreboding than all but those phantoms with the fear emotional focus. Many of them manifest as dark and dreadful knights, their armor bristling with spikes and their hands seeming to grasp barbed and terrible weapons. Other times they appear as tall, gaunt figures staring down arrogantly at those who approach. These phantoms typically spew a string of curses at their foes, often profane, sometimes poetic. Their auras are pulsating and pitch black, and thrum violently when these horrible phantoms attack.</p>
				<p><b>Skills: </b>The phantom gains a number of ranks in Acrobatics and Perception equal to its number of Hit Dice. While confined in the spiritualist&#146;s consciousness, the phantom grants the spiritualist Skill Focus in each of these skills.</p>
				<p><b>Good Saves: </b>Fortitude and Reflex.</p>
				<p><b>Weapon Finesse: </b>The phantom gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat.</p>
				<p><b>Hated Target (Su): </b>The phantom can take a move action to designate one creature within its line of sight as a hated target. The phantom gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls against its hated target, and a bonus on damage rolls equal to 1/2 the phantom&#146;s Hit Dice (minimum 1). The phantom is so focused on this hated target that it takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls against all other creatures. The phantom can maintain these bonuses against only one target at a time, and these bonuses remain in effect until either the hated opponent is dead or it has been out of the phantom&#146;s line of sight for at least 1 minute. When the spiritualist reaches 7th level, the phantom can use this ability as a swift action, and takes no penalty when attacking creatures that are not designated as its hated enemy. The phantom must be manifested in ectoplasmic form to use this ability (unless the spiritualist is 17th level or higher; see Shared Hatred below).</p>
				<p><b>Hateful Aura (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 7th level, as a swift action, the phantom can emit a 10-foot-radius aura that inflicts pain upon the minds of those who dare damage it or its master. Enemies within the aura that deal damage to the spiritualist or the phantom take an amount of damage equal to the phantom&#146;s Charisma bonus. This is a mind-affecting pain effect. The phantom can use this ability in either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form.</p>
				<p><b>Sneak Attack (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 12th level, the phantom gains sneak attack +3d6, but only against its hated enemy. At 18th level, the sneak attack damage increases to +5d6.</p>
				<p><b>Shared Hatred (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 17th level, the phantom can grant its hatred to others. When the phantom designates a hated enemy, its allies also gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls and a +4 bonus on damage rolls against that enemy. Furthermore, the phantom can use its hated target ability even when in incorporeal form; when it does, it can make slam attacks against a corporeal creature, but only if that corporeal creature is its hated target.</p>

			<name type="string">Greed</name>
			<text type="formattedtext">
				<p>A phantom with this focus voraciously coveted gold, gems, and hedonistic possessions in life. Such phantoms are still obsessed with hoarding wealth and project that avarice onto the spiritualists to whom they are bonded. Their coloration tends toward yellow, and the sound of jangling coins sometime manifests when they attack.</p>
				<p><b>Skills: </b>The phantom gains a number of ranks in Appraise and Sleight of Hand equal to its number of Hit Dice. While confined in the spiritualist&#146;s consciousness, the phantom grants the spiritualist Skill Focus in each of these skills.</p>
				<p><b>Good Saves: </b>Fortitude and Reflex.</p>
				<p><b>Eye of Avarice: </b>The phantom adds half its number of Hit Dice (minimum 1) as a bonus on its Appraise checks. While it is confined to the spiritualist&#146;s consciousness, when the spiritualist attempts to identify the properties of a magic item using detect magic, the phantom grants the spiritualist this bonus on Spellcraft check.</p>
				<p><b>Ruthless Combatant (Su): </b>A phantom with this focus threatens a critical hit with its slam attacks on a result of 19&#150;20. At 11th level, its critical multiplier with slam attacks increases to &#215;3.</p>
				<p><b>Assume Effect (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 7th level, when she casts a spell on herself with a range other than personal, the spell can also affect her phantom. The phantom can benefit from this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day when the spiritualist reaches 12th level and a third time when the spiritualist reaches 19th level.</p>
				<p><b>Covetous Aura (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 12th level, as a swift action the phantom can emit a 20-footradius aura that exemplifies its covetous nature. The aura lasts for a number of rounds per day equal to the phantom&#146;s Hit Dice. These rounds need not be used consecutively, and the phantom can dismiss its covetous aura as a free action. Whenever a harmless (so noted by a spell&#146;s saving throw description) spell of 2nd level or lower is cast by a creature within the covetous aura, the phantom can immediately gain the benefit of that spell as if the spell had also targeted it. The intended target still gains the effect of the spell.</p>
				<p><b>Take It with You (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 17th level, whenever the phantom is reduced to 0 hit points, a number of harmless spells affecting the phantom equal to the phantom&#146;s Charisma modifier are immediately transferred to the spiritualist for the remainder of their duration. If desired, the spiritualist can transfer only some (or none) of the spells affecting the phantom.</p>

			<name type="string">Fear</name>
			<text type="formattedtext">
				<p>A phantom with this emotional focus suffered from overwhelming fear in life. As a phantom, it is able to channel that fear into a terrifying weapon. Fear phantoms are often horrifying to behold. Sometimes they appear as ghostly figures in tattered funeral garb or wrapped in chains or other bindings. Their features may be distorted into gaunt and haunting forms, making them seem more like ghosts or spectres. A miasma of livid gray swirling motes often surrounds their forms as they stalk their surroundings, seeking to bestow their terror on others.</p>
				<p><b>Skills: </b>The phantom gains a number of ranks in Intimidate and Stealth equal to its number of Hit Dice. While confined in the spiritualist&#146;s consciousness, such a phantom grants the spiritualist Skill Focus in each of these skills.</p>
				<p><b>Good Saves: </b>Reflex and Will.</p>
				<p><b>Stealthy: </b>The phantom gains Stealthy as a bonus feat.</p>
				<p><b>Horrifying Strike (Ex): </b>If the phantom hits a creature with a slam attack, that creature must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the phantom&#146;s Hit Dice + the phantom&#146;s Charisma modifier) or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. Multiple attacks against the same creature do not cause the creature to become frightened. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
				<p><b>Increase Fear (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 7th level, as a swift action, the phantom can emit a 20-footradius aura that amplifies the fear conditions of enemies within it if they fail their Will saving throws (DC = 10 + 1/2 the phantom&#146;s Hit Dice + the phantom&#146;s Charisma modifier). A shaken enemy in the aura becomes frightened, a frightened creature becomes panicked, and a panicked creature cowers. This effect lasts either as long as the enemy stays within the aura and is under the condition of the initial fear effect, or for a number of rounds after it leaves the aura equal to 1/2 the phantom&#146;s Hit Dice, or until the end of the original fear effect&#146;s duration, whichever comes first. A creature that succeeds at the saving throw is immune to this effect from the same phantom for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The phantom can use this ability in either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form.</p>
				<p><b>Frightful Attack (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 12th level, if the phantom hits with a slam attack, it can frighten those it hits instead of causing them to be shaken (the phantom chooses when it makes the attack). This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
				<p><b>Shelter Allies (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 17th level, the phantom protects its allies from terror. Allies within the phantom&#146;s increase fear aura are immune to fear as long as they are within the aura. This ability also grants the phantom&#146;s spiritualist master immunity to fear as long as the phantom is not banished to the Ethereal Plane.</p>

			<name type="string">Desperation</name>
			<text type="formattedtext">
				<p>A phantom with this emotional focus died desperate and panicking&#151;a victim of drowning, suffocation, or some other inexorable and traumatic death. The phantom relives its horrific demise over and over, futilely clawing at its foes to save itself and dragging them down with it. Desperation phantoms often hold power over water, though a phantom that died in a cave-in might display powers that are reminiscent of pressing rock instead. Desperation phantoms eschew coherent forms, usually appearing as a cloud of grasping hands and screaming faces. A blue-gray aura tends to surround these phantoms when they manifest.</p>
				<p><b>Skills: </b>The phantom gains a number of ranks in Acrobatics and Escape Artist equal to its number of Hit Dice. While confined in the spiritualist&#146;s consciousness, such a phantom grants the spiritualist Skill Focus in each of these skills.</p>
				<p><b>Good Saves: </b>Reflex and Will.</p>
				<p><b>Combat Reflexes: </b>The phantom gains Combat Reflexes as a bonus feat. Furthermore, when the phantom is within its master&#146;s consciousness, it grants the benefits of Combat Reflexes to its master (if its master doesn&#146;t have that feat).</p>
				<p><b>Frantic Grip (Ex): </b>The phantom can add its Dexterity modifier instead of its Strength modifier to its combat maneuver bonus when attempting to grapple. When the phantom is below half its total hit points, it gains a +4 bonus on grapple attempts and to its CMD against grapple combat maneuvers.</p>
				<p><b>Aura of Desperation (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 7th level, the phantom can emit a 10-foot-radius aura that fills its foes with the sensation of drowning, suffocation, or another terrible impending death. It can activate this aura as a swift action. Enemies attempting to cast a spell with a verbal component within the aura must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 10 + half the phantom&#146;s Hit Dice + the level of the spell being cast) or lose the spell. This is a mind-affecting effect. Deactivating the aura is a free action.</p>
				<p><b>Clutch of Terror (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 12th level, the phantom can summon a mass of hands to grapple an enemy within 60 feet as a standard action. The hands immediately attempt a grapple combat maneuver against the target using the phantom&#146;s statistics (including the phantom&#146;s CMB), except the hands are collectively considered to be the same size as the target. On following rounds, the hands attempt to maintain the grapple (the hands cannot pin the target, however). Each round that the hands successfully grapple a target, the hands also deal the phantom&#146;s normal slam damage to the target. The hands immediately disappear and the effect ends if the hands fail to grapple their target, if the target escapes the grapple or dies, or if the phantom ceases to be manifested. The effect also ends if the phantom uses this ability against a different target. The phantom can use this ability three times per day.</p>
				<p><b>Burst of Desperation (Sp): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 17th level, once per day as a standard action, the phantom can affect itself and the spiritualist with the effects of haste. The caster level of this effect is equal to the spiritualist&#146;s caster level. The phantom or the spiritualist can dismiss this effect as a free action. The duration of this ability must be used all at once, and any of the effect&#146;s remaining rounds per day are lost after this ability is dismissed.</p>

			<name type="string">Dedication</name>
			<text type="formattedtext">
				<p>Either through a sense of love or the desire to finish some unfinished task, a phantom with this emotional focus has an undying devotion to something or someone in the world. It&#146;s often the case that a phantom with this emotional focus has a strong familial tie with its spiritualist master. A dedication phantom most often appears as a strong and stern protector with a watchful gaze, and its service to its spiritualist is unwavering. These spirits exude auras of blue, or sometimes rose if their love for their spiritualist masters in life was great. Many times these auras manifest as a halo, giving these phantoms a divine appearance, no matter their actual alignment or opinions on matters of religion.</p>
				<p><b>Skills: </b>The phantom gains a number of ranks in Diplomacy and Sense Motive equal to its number of Hit Dice. While confined in the spiritualist&#146;s consciousness, the phantom grants the spiritualist Skill Focus in each of these skills.</p>
				<p><b>Good Saves: </b>Reflex and Will.</p>
				<p><b>Iron Will: </b>The phantom gains Iron Will as a bonus feat. Furthermore, when the phantom is within its master&#146;s consciousness, it grants the benefits of Iron Will to its master if its master doesn&#146;t have that feat.</p>
				<p><b>Dutiful Strike (Su): </b>When a creature makes an attack against the phantom&#146;s master, the phantom gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls against that target, and deals damage against that target as if the phantom were one size category larger. For the purposes of this ability, an attack includes any harmful spell targeting the spiritualist master of whose area or effect includes the spiritualist master. Dutiful strike lasts for 1 minute, until another creature attacks the phantom&#146;s spiritualist master (at which point this effect transfers to the new attacker), or until the attacking creature is reduced to fewer than 0 hit points, whichever occurs first.</p>
				<p><b>Defending Aura (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 7th level, the phantom can emit a 10-foot-radius aura that grants protection to nearby allies. It can activate this aura at will as a swift action. Allies within the aura gain a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 bonus to CMD and on all saving throws. Deactivating the aura is a free action.</p>
				<p><b>Devoted Servant (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 12th level and is caught unawares by an attack (such as an attack made in a surprise round or while the spiritualist is asleep or an attack by a creature using Stealth), if the phantom is not fully manifested, it automatically fully manifests from the spiritualist&#146;s consciousness to protect its master. The phantom stays manifested as long as the spiritualist is unaware and in danger. This ability requires no action from the spiritualist.</p>
				<p><b>Steadfast Devotion (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 17th level, the phantom becomes immune to detrimental mind-affecting effects and all forms of possession, such as magic jar and possession (see page 181). Furthermore, the phantom is immune to banishment, dismissal, and similar effects.</p>

			<name type="string">Anger</name>
			<text type="formattedtext">
				<p>Phantoms with this emotional focus are filled with seething anger from events in their past lives. Phantoms with this focus often take the form of hulking brutes with furrowed brows or of frenzied creatures that always seem ready to strike down those who come too near. Many times, these phantoms exude a bright red aura, especially when they are engaged in combat, or they seem to breathe a red mist in shallow pants from behind clenched, phantasmal teeth.</p>
				<p><b>Skills: </b>The phantom gains a number of ranks in Intimidate and Survival equal to its number of Hit Dice. While confined in the spiritualist&#146;s consciousness, the phantom grants the spiritualist Skill Focus in each of these skills.</p>
				<p><b>Good Saves: </b>Fortitude and Will.</p>
				<p><b>Strength Focus: </b>The phantom gains a +2 bonus to Strength and a &#150;2 penalty to Dexterity. Instead of the phantom gaining a bonus to Dexterity as the spiritualist gains levels, an anger-focused phantom gains a bonus to Strength instead.</p>
				<p><b>Powerful Strike (Ex): </b>A phantom with this focus deals more damage with its slam attacks. It deals slam damage as a creature one size category larger than its current size. The phantom also gains Power Attack as a bonus feat.</p>
				<p><b>Aura of Fury (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 7th level, as a swift action, the phantom can emit a 20-foot-radius aura of fury. Creatures within the aura gain a +2 bonus on melee attack rolls but take a &#150;2 penalty to AC. Ending the aura is a free action. The phantom can use this ability in either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form.</p>
				<p><b>Ferocious Mien (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 12th level, once per day as a swift action, a phantom in ectoplasmic form can grow more ferocious and frightening. It becomes one size category larger than its current size, as affected by an enlarge person spell, and grows fiercer in combat, as if affected by a rage spell. This effect lasts for 1 round per class level of the spiritualist. When the spiritualist reaches 18th level, a phantom using ferocious mien also gains the frightful presence extraordinary ability (Bestiary 300; range 30 feet, duration 5d6 rounds).</p>
				<p><b>Furious Wail (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 17th level, once per day as a standard action, the phantom can emit a single angry wail that acts as wail of the banshee. The phantom uses its Hit Dice as its caster level for the effect, and the DC of the effect is 10 + 1/2 the phantom&#146;s Hit Dice + the phantom&#146;s Charisma modifier. The phantom can use this ability in either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form.</p>

				<p>At 1st level, when an opponent attempts a melee attack against the swashbuckler, the swashbuckler can as an immediate action spend 1 panache point to move 5 feet; doing so grants the swashbuckler a dodge bonus to AC equal to her Charisma modif ier (minimum 0) against the triggering attack. This movement doesn&#146;t negate the attack, which is still resolved as if the swashbuckler had not moved from the original square. This movement is not a 5-foot step; it provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures other than the one who triggered this deed. The swashbuckler can only perform this deed while wearing light or no armor, and while carrying no heavier than a light load.</p>

				<p>At 1st level, when an opponent makes a melee attack against the swashbuckler, she can spend 1 panache point and expend a use of an attack of opportunity to attempt to parry that attack. The swashbuckler makes an attack roll as if she were making an attack of opportunity; for each size category the attacking creature is larger than the swashbuckler, the swashbuckler takes a &#150;2 penalty on this roll. If her result is greater than the attacking creature&#146;s result, the creature&#146;s attack automatically misses. The swashbuckler must declare the use of this ability after the creature&#146;s attack is announced, but before its attack roll is made. Upon performing a successful parry and if she has at least 1 panache point, the swashbuckler can as an immediate action make an attack against the creature whose attack she parried, provided that creature is within her reach. This deed's cost cannot be reduced by any ability or effect that reduces the number of panache points a deed costs.</p>

				<p>At 3rd level, while she has at least 1 panache point, a swashbuckler gains the ability to strike precisely with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon (though not natural weapon attacks), adding her swashbuckler level to the damage dealt. To use this deed, a swashbuckler cannot attack with a weapon in her other hand or use a shield other than a buckler. She can even use this ability with thrown light or onehanded piercing melee weapons, so long as the target is within 30 feet of her. Any creature that is immune to sneak attacks is immune to the additional damage granted by precise strike, and any item or ability that protects a creature from critical hits also protects a creature from the additional damage of a precise strike. This additional damage is precision damage, and isn&#146;t multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
				<p>As a swift action, a swashbuckler can spend 1 panache point to double her precise strike&#146;s damage bonus on the next attack. This benefit must be used before the end of her turn, or it is lost.

If the attack succeeds, in addition to the attack&#146;s normal damage, the target suffers one of the following effects based on the part of the body targeted.

				<p>When the vigilante attempts an Acrobatics check to move through an opponent&#146;s space during a move action, he can attempt a single melee attack against that opponent as a swift action. If the Acrobatics check succeeds, this attack applies the vigilante&#146;s hidden strike damage as if the foe were unaware of the vigilante. Otherwise, the vigilante applies the hidden strike damage he would deal if the target were denied its Dexterity bonus to AC. Only a stalker vigilante of at least 4th level can select this talent.</p>

If he succeeds, the creature he is grappling becomes the new target of the attack. If the check fails, the creature escapes the grapple and the vigilante is the target of the attack as normal. This ability must be used after the attack is declared against the vigilante, but before the attack is made and the results revealed.</p>

				<p>The vigilante combines strength and speed into incredibly deadly attacks. He gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat, and if he already has the Weapon Finesse feat, he can immediately swap it for another feat for which he qualified at the level he chose Weapon Finesse. When using Weapon Finesse to make a melee attack using his Dexterity bonus on attack rolls and his Strength bonus on damage rolls, he also adds half his vigilante level on damage rolls. This bonus damage is not reduced or increased if the vigilante is wielding a weapon two-handed or in an off-hand.</p>

				<p>The vigilante becomes known for deeds and abilities regardless of his current identity.

While he is in his social identity, a vigilante can spend 1 week gaining renown among the locals of any community of no more than about 200 individuals (a village, if using settlement population ranges on page 203 of the Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide). This could be the entire community or a smaller neighborhood in a larger settlement. He must spend at least 4 hours each day socializing and making contacts. After spending 1 week doing this, whenever he is in his social identity, all NPCs in the community have a starting attitude toward him that is one category better, as long as each person&#146;s initial attitude would have at least been indifferent (see the Diplomacy skill description on pages 93&#150; 94 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook for more information). While he gains renown in an area using his social identity, he also spreads rumors and tales about his vigilante identity. Once he has gained renown in a community, he gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks whenever he is in his vigilante identity. This bonus applies only while he is near the community in which he has gained renown; he must be within a number of miles equal to his vigilante level.</p>
				<p>A vigilante can hold renown in a limited number of communities (normally one, with other social talents allowing two). If he gains renown in a new community, he must decide which one of his previous communities to lose. These effects are subject to GM approval. For example, the GM might rule that an NPC or monster has not heard any tales about the vigilante. Or, a foe may have a starting attitude toward him that&#146;s one category worse, rather than one category better.</p>

This social talent functions exactly as the renown social talent, but instead of improving the starting attitude of all NPCs within the community, it empowers the vigilante so that he no longer needs to succeed at Disguise checks to appear as his social identity while assuming that identity within his area of obscurity. He still has to attempt Disguise checks when NPCs within this settlement are confronted with indisputable proof that the vigilante could be more than he appears to be, such as when he uses a vigilante talent while in his social identity. This social talent counts as renown for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of social talents that list renown as a prerequisite and can be improved by such talents. A vigilante with this talent cannot select renown, nor can he select any social talent that requires him to be famous (such as celebrity discount or celebrity perks).</p>

			<name type="string">Many Guises</name>
			<text type="formattedtext">
				<p>The vigilante can take on any number of mundane guises. Whenever he changes his identity, he has a third option (instead of social or vigilante): he can become mundane. The mundane identity is not a specific individual. Each one is created at the moment it is assumed, and quickly forgotten as soon as it is removed. While in a mundane identity, the vigilante does not gain the benefit of either his social or vigilante identity, but instead appears as a member of his race, usually a common laborer, farmer, or peasant of any gender. His alignment is treated as neutral when he is in his mundane identity. While in this identity, he receives a +20 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to appear like an ordinary member of his race. Spells and abilities that are looking for the vigilante in either of his other identities fail while he is in his mundane identity. He must build the appearance for this identity using whatever clothing and tools he has at his disposal. While he can use magic (such as a hat of disguise), his mundane identity can never be anything other than an ordinary member of a society or large group (subject to GM discretion). A vigilante must be at least 5th level to select this talent.</p>

				<p>The vigilante gains the service of a number of loyal allies who can help him gather information, cover for his two identities, or perform minor tasks. Inside his area of renown, a vigilante with this talent gains a bonus on Diplomacy checks to gather information equal to half his vigilante level.</p>
				<p>In addition, if the vigilante wants, he can task his friends to help cover for him by spreading false tales of his location and activities to others. This has the effect of increasing the DC of Diplomacy checks to gather information about the vigilante and Survival checks to track him by an amount equal to his level. This lasts for 1 day, and can be used only once per week.</p>
				<p>Finally, once per day, the vigilante can ask his allies to perform a minor task for him. This usually involves delivering a message, purchasing a piece of mundane gear worth 100 gp or less (which the vigilante must pay for), or retrieving an object owned by the vigilante (that would be easily accessible by the ally). This task might take other forms as well, subject to GM discretion, but can never involve combat or danger. A vigilante must be at least 3rd level and have the renown social talent to select this talent.</p>

For example, if a vigilante has a lawful-neutral social identity and a neutral vigilante identity, he has a 50% chance of taking only half damage from a chaos hammer spell while in his social identity, since he would always take only half damage from a chaos hammer spell when in his vigilante identity.</p>

				<p><i>Heightened Senses (Ex): </i>At 2nd level, an arachnid wildsoul can anticipate physical danger and react astonishingly quickly. He gains the stalker sense vigilante talent, even if he is not a stalker.</p>
				<p><i>Shoot Webs (Ex): </i>At 6th level, an arachnid wildsoul&#146;s wrists can produce thick, sticky webbing that he can shoot at his enemies. Shooting webbing is a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. The webbing acts as a tanglefoot bag when it hits a creature, except the DC of the Reflex save to avoid being glued to the floor or unable to fly is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arachnid wildsoul&#146;s vigilante level + his Constitution modifier. Like a tanglefoot bag, the webbing does not work underwater. The arachnid wildsoul can shoot webs a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Constitution modifier.</p>
				<p><i>Web Specialist (Ex) </i>: At 12th level, an arachnid wildsoul can coat his hands and feet in super-sticky webbing, even over equipment such as gloves and boots. This gives him a climb speed of 30 feet. Additionally, as a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity, an arachnid wildsoul can use his webbing to create the equivalent of a 50-foot length of silk rope (hp 4, break DC 24) and can shoot it at any flat, unoccupied surface that is at least one 5-foot square in size. If the arachnid wildsoul succeeds at a ranged attack against AC 10, the rope sticks fast to the surface, can only be removed if it is destroyed, and can support the weight of the arachnid wildsoul plus one additional Medium or smaller creature. If more creatures attempt to use the webbing rope, it is destroyed. This costs a daily use of shoot webs.</p>
				<p><i>Web Master (Ex) </i>At 18th level, an arachnid wildsoul can use web specialist without spending a daily use of shoot webs. Additionally, he can create numerous web-ropes as he is moving and swing from rope to rope, essentially allowing him to move at his base speed through the air as long as he always uses at least one hand to hold the webbing and continues to have tether points within 50 feet and above him. The web ropes he creates in this way dissolve as soon as he is done using them to swing.</p>

				<p><i>Take to the Air (Ex) </i>At 12th level, a falconine wildsoul can harness the flight inherent in his blood. While in his vigilante identity, he has feathery wings that grant him a fly speed of 40 feet (with good maneuverability).</p>
				<p><i>Deadly Dive (Ex): </i>At 18th level, a falconine wildsoul has learned how to mimic the swooping and diving of birds of prey. As a full-round action while he is flying at least 30 feet above the ground, a falconine wildsoul can dive onto a creature by moving up to twice his fly speed and make a single melee attack. The movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal, and the attack provokes an attack of opportunity from the attack&#146;s target. If the attack is successful, the falconine wildsoul deals the attack&#146;s damage plus 2d6 points of damage for every 10 feet he dove (to a maximum of 20d6 damage if he dove 100 feet or more). Even if the attack misses, the target still takes the extra damage for the distance of the dive, but it receives a Reflex save to halve the damage (DC = 10 + 1/2 the falconine wildsoul&#146;s vigilante level + his Strength or Dexterity modifier, whichever is higher). A falconine vigilante can dive in this way a number of times per day equal to his Strength or Dexterity modifier, whichever is higher.</p>

While transformed, he becomes a grizzly bear (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 31) as beast shape II. An ursine wildsoul loses his ability to speak while in bear form and is limited to the sounds that a normal bear can make, though he can communicate normally with other bears, as speak with animal.</p>

(For example, transporting yourself 40 feet costs 2 uses of your blessing, and transporting an additional person this distance costs 1 more use.)</p>

				<p>A witch with this grand hex can pluck a dead creature&#146;s soul from the River of Souls and store it in her familiar for safekeeping and eventual resurrection. In order to use this ability, the witch must be adjacent to the target dead creature and her own familiar, and the ally&#146;s soul must be free and willing to return at the witch&#146;s behest. When the witch touches the creature&#146;s remains (some small portion of the creature&#146;s body must still exist, and it may have been dead for any amount of time), its soul enters the body of the witch&#146;s familiar as per familiar meldingUM, as if the witch&#146;s familiar were the target&#146;s familiar. The creature&#146;s soul can remain within the witch&#146;s familiar for up to 1 hour per class level the witch has. During this time, the witch can telepathically communicate with the creature&#146;s soul (though the soul cannot do anything else), and the witch can return the ally to life. Doing so is a standard action that returns the creature&#146;s soul to its body, brings it back to life with a number of hit points equal to 5d8 + 1 hit point per the witch&#146;s caster level. The witch must be within 300 feet of the creature&#146;s body to return it to life. If a creature&#146;s soul is in the witch&#146;s familiar and this effect expires, or if the witch attempts to return the creature to life but is out of range, the creature remains dead. Once a creature has benefited from this hex, it cannot benefit from it again for 24 hours.</p>

At the end of this time, the subject receives a brief image of the future, usually no more than 1 year from the time of the vision, subject to GM discretion. This is only one possible version of the future, making such visions unreliable at best. Most visions are slanted toward the alignment of the witch that granted them. For example, the visions granted by a chaotic evil witch often show scenes of death and destruction, while those of a neutral good witch tend to be of joyous events or occasions. A creature cannot be subject to another vision until the current vision has either come to pass or been prevented. A witch cannot use this ability on herself. Unwilling creatures receive a Will save to negate the vision.</p>

If she chooses an opponent, that opponent takes a &#150;2 penalty to AC against traps and on Reflex saves against traps. Either way, the effects last for 1 minute. The target can attempt a Will save to negate the effects of the hex. At 8th level, the bonus or penalty increases to 4. At 16th level, the bonus or penalty increases to 6. A creature targeted by this hex cannot be targeted again by this hex for 1 day.</p>

Either residual effect lasts 1 minute per witch level. Any creature can safely remove the enchanted threads with a minute of work and a successful DC 25 Heal check.</p>

				<p>At 16th level, once per day when a tatterdemalion is hit by a melee or ranged attack, she can unravel herself as an immediate action, causing her body and gear to appear to collapse into a bundle of tattered rags and strands while she teleports to any open square within 30 feet. She takes no damage from the triggering attack, but she must have line of effect to the target square. She can use this ability twice per day at 20th level.</p>

An Arcanamirium crafter is one of the builders of the arcane world, assembling magic items with facility, skill, and power. He is intimately familiar with the craft and practice of imbuing items with arcane power, and works with precision even early in his career to help create some of the most powerful magic items of Golarion.</p>

				<p>The city of Katheer is home to a great number of arcane colleges in the Qadiran tradition. Magic has a proud history in this land; its many schools compete with one another to find the best route to understanding the secrets of power.</p>
				<p>Among these is the focused school of veil magic. Rather than controlling the elements or transforming the environment, mages of the veil focus on much more subtle magic&#151;blending into their surroundings to watch, observe, and gather secrets, or fading from view completely for the sake of solitude. Most graduates of this college enter the service of the satrap as spies, scouts, or infiltrators.</p>
				<p><b>Requirements: </b>A mage of the veil must select disguise self as one of his spells known at 1st level.</p>
				<p><b>Class Skills: </b>A mage of the veil gains Bluff, Disguise, and Stealth as class skills.</p>
				<p><b>Associated School: </b>Illusion.</p>
				<p><b>Replacement Powers: </b>The following school powers replace the blinding ray and invisibility field powers of the illusion school.</p>

				<p>At 1st level as a standard action, you can cause yourself to appear so normal, mundane, and unexceptional that you blend in to your surroundings. All creatures within 30 feet treat you as if you belonged there, effectively ignoring you. Creatures outside of this area may notice that you appear out of place, but as soon as they approach within 30 feet they are affected by the magic and no longer think something is amiss. If you interact with an affected creature in any way, it gains a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier) to disbelieve the illusion and notice you. The effect lasts for a number of minutes equal to your wizard level, or until the illusion is dispelled. The minutes do not need to be consecutive, but must be used in 1-minute increments. This is a mind-affecting phantasm effect.</p>
				<p>This ability does not turn you invisible and opponents are not considered flat-footed. It does not allow you to disguise yourself as a specific individual, type of person, or member of another race, so you cannot blend into a group of uniformed guards or appear as a member of an individual&#146;s family, and a human cannot blend into a group of gnolls. You can blend in with any group made up of different types of people, such as a crowd of courtiers in a king&#146;s throne room, and you can disguise yourself (either through magic or more mundane means) to appear as a specific type of person or another race (such as a uniformed guard or a gnoll) before using this ability.</p>

A creature entangled by your shadows has concealment from those without darkvision or the ability to see in darkness, and other creatures likewise have concealment relative to it.

You can travel up to 30 feet per wizard level per day in this fashion, either in a single round or broken up across multiple shadow steps. This movement must be used in 5-foot increments and does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Travel through the Shadow Plane is imprecise; when you arrive, you re-enter 1 square off target, as per the rules for thrown splash weapons. If this would place you in an occupied square, you instead arrive in the nearest safe location. When you arrive, you are cloaked in shadow and gain concealment as the blur spell for 1 round. You may bring other willing creatures with you, but you must expend an equal amount of distance for each additional creature brought with you. They likewise re-enter off target (roll location for each creature) and are cloaked in shadow for 1 round.</p>

Any magical source of energy of this type with a caster level equal to or less than your wizard level is altered to the chosen energy type. This includes supernatural effects from creatures with Hit Dice no greater than your caster level. For example, you could transform a white dragon's frigid breath weapon (a supernatural ability), but not a fire elemental's fiery touch (an extraordinary ability). If an effect lies only partially within your aura, only the portions within the aura are transformed. You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level.

				<p>The prestigious Egorian Academy of the Magical Arts in Cheliax&#146;s capital city teaches a full spectrum of magic, both specialized and universalist, but the college is best known for its Infernal Binding program in the school of conjuration. An infernal binder learns the Names of Hell, and can use those powers to summon and bind devils to do her bidding. If she makes a single mistake in the binding, she opens herself to an eternity of torment. Egorian Academy wizards are recognized across Avistan as premier practitioners of the arcane arts. Many hold high positions in magical colleges across Golarion, but most seek to return one day to teach at their alma mater in Egorian.</p>
				<p><b>Suggested Opposition Schools: </b>Divination, illusion, or transmutation.</p>
				<p><b>Alignment: </b>Lawful Evil, Lawful Neutral, Neutral Evil, or Neutral.</p>
				<p><b>Requirements: </b>An infernal binder must choose a familiar as her arcane bond at 1st level.</p>

This does not increase the duration of the original summoning. The original summoning caster can attempt to regain control of the summoned creature as a standard action by making a caster level check against your caster level + 10.

If you succeed at a ranged touch attack, the mud slams into the target&#146;s face, dealing 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage for every 2 wizard levels you have and blinding the target for 1d4 rounds. A creature can remove the blinding mud from itself or another creature with a successful Strength check (DC = 10 + half your wizard level) as a standard action.

				<p>The void is a complex idea considered by some to be a fifth element&#151;one that comprises thought, space, spiritualism, and insight. Wizards who tap into its mysterious powers gain control over energies that bind the earth to the heavens and the planes to their mysterious and eternal alignments, as well as the powers that stitch living beings to their spirits. The void elemental school presented here is an additional arcane school for the wizard class.</p>
				<p>A wizard who specializes in the void element gains a number of school powers and one bonus spell slot of each level that the wizard can cast, from 1st on up. This bonus spell slot must be used to prepare a spell from the void elemental school&#146;s spell list. Unlike a normal arcane school, the void elemental school requires the wizard to select a single element (air, earth, fire, or water) as his opposition school. A wizard must expend two spell slots to prepare a spell from his opposed elemental school as normal. He does not need to select a second opposition school.</p>

				<p>You gain a +2 enhancement bonus on Sleight of Hand checks. This bonus increases by 1 for every 5 wizard levels you have. In addition, you can cast mage hand at will as a spell-like ability that uses your caster level. At 5th level, you can attempt Sleight of Hand checks against a target within 30 feet, though the skill check DC increases by 5, and any creature within line of sight of either you or the target can attempt an opposed Perception check to notice the attempt. At 10th level, you can attempt a Sleight of Hand check as a move action with only a &#150;10 penalty. At 20th level, whenever you attempt a Sleight of Hand check, assume the roll resulted in a natural 20.</p>

			<name type="string">True Name</name>
			<text type="formattedtext">
				<p>Your researches into ancient tomes and your inquisitions of bound spirits have led you to one of the best-hidden secrets of the multiverse: the true name of an outsider&#151;the name that defines the very essence of the creature and that gives the speaker control over the being. This outsider can have no more than 12 Hit Dice. Once per day, you can speak the common name by which the outsider is known, and the outsider travels to you as if you had cast planar binding upon it. It must obey you to the best of its ability, without pay or bargaining for its services, for its fear that you might release its true name to the wider world is enough to bring even the most recalcitrant of outsiders to bear.</p>
				<p>If the creature is within 100 feet, as a move action, you may punish it by deliberately mispronouncing its name, wracking its very essence and giving it the sickened and staggered conditions for 1 round (even if the creature is normally immune to these conditions). You cannot use true name in an area of silence, but the creature does not have to be able to hear you for it to be harmed by the ability.</p>
				<p>It is in your best interest to call this creature only sparingly, and occasionally reward it in some fashion to mollify its wrath. If you repeatedly fail to offer it a reward appropriate to its type and ethos, the creature may begin plotting ways to destroy the bond between you, whether by creating an accident that will destroy your memory of the name, by plaguing you with nuisances or dangers until you vow never to call on it again, or by actively seeking to destroy you through its own devices or those of an underling. If this creature is of a lawful type and you are violating its ethos, its superiors may even destroy it or you rather than allow you to contaminate their servant further. Worse, they may establish situations where it is necessary for you to summon this outsider, opening gateways to infernal or angelic interference, in order to gain a foothold on the Material Plane.</p>
				<p>You may select this discovery multiple times. Each time you select this discovery, it applies to a different, specific outsider. You must be at least an 11th-level wizard to select this discovery. If you select this discovery at 15th level or higher, the creature may have up to 18 Hit Dice and the call acts as greater planar binding instead of planar binding.</p>

			<name type="string">Split Slot</name>
			<text type="formattedtext">
				<p>Once per day when you prepare spells, you may treat any one of your open spell slots as if it were two spell slots that were two spell levels lower. For example, a 9th-level wizard can split a 5th-level slot into two 3rd-level slots, preparing fireball and lightning bolt in those 3rd-level slots. For all purposes, the two lower-level slots are treated as that lower level (so the split 5th-level slot used for a fireball has a DC as if it were in a normal 3rd-level slot). Splitting a 2nd-level slot lets you prepare two additional cantrips (which you can cast over and over, just like normally prepared cantrips). This discovery has no effect on cantrips or 1st&#150;level spells. You may select this discovery multiple times; each time you select it, you may split another spell slot when you prepare spells. You cannot split a slot that you created by splitting a higher-level slot. You must be at least 5th level to select this discovery.</p>

When you cast this spell, it operates as a psychic spell, including using emotional and thought components in place of somatic and verbal components, and only having expensive material components.</p>
