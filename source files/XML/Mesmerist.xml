					<p>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist adds 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Bluff checks. In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesn&#146;t have Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of at least 13. He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater Feint.</p>

				<name type="string">Hypnotic Stare</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>

				<name type="string">Knacks</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>

				<name type="string">Mesmerist Trick</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
					<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
					<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>

					<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>

				<name type="string">Painful Stare</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>-</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Mesmerist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Consummate Liar: </b>A mesmerist adds 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Bluff checks. In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesn&#146;t have Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of at least 13. He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater Feint.</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su): </b>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Painful Stare (Su): </b>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>
			<p><b>Towering Ego (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a mesmerist gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 0) on Will saving throws. If the mesmerist is under any effect that would prevent him from providing the emotional component of psychic spells (see page 144), he loses this bonus on saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Bold Stare (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can&#146;t be changed later. The mesmerist can&#146;t choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist&#146;s bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Touch Treatment (Su): </b>At 3rd level, the mesmerist can help allies shake off harmful conditions&#151;especially those that affect their minds&#151;by channeling psychic energy through his healing hands. He can use touch treatment a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the mesmerist uses it on himself ), and the mesmerist must be able to touch his target. He can remove one condition from one target each time he uses this ability. At 3rd level, he can remove any condition on the minor conditions list. At 6th level, he can remove any condition on the minor or moderate conditions list, and at 10th level, he can remove any condition on the minor, moderate, or greater conditions list.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Minor Conditions: </i>Fascinated, shaken.</li>
				<li><i>Moderate Conditions: </i>Confused, dazed, frightened, sickened.</li>
				<li><i>Greater Conditions: </i>Cowering, nauseated, panicked, stunned.</li>
			</list>
			<p>A 14th level, the mesmerist can instead expend one use of touch treatment to replicate the effects of break enchantment. This targets only one creature the mesmerist is touching and follows all other restrictions of touch treatment.</p>
			<p><b>Manifold Tricks (Su): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can have two tricks implanted at a time. The number of concurrent tricks increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he possesses beyond 5th. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist&#146;s tricks).</p>
			<p><b>Mental Potency (Ex): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment or illusion spell he casts increase by 1. For enchantment and illusion spells he casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be). For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>
			<p><b>Glib Lie (Su): </b>At 11th level, a mesmerist can deceive truthdetecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the mesmerist&#146;s class level to succeed (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn&#146;t detect the mesmerist&#146;s lies or force him to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the mesmerist the glibness spell&#146;s bonus on Bluff checks.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>Rule Minds (Su): </b>At 20th level, a mesmerist can permanently mentally enslave a creature. When the mesmerist successfully affects the target of his hypnotic stare with an enchantment spell that requires a saving throw, he can force that creature to attempt a second Will saving throw with a DC equal to the spell&#146;s DC. The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn&#146;t a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can&#146;t be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.</p>

To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39.

This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.

The target does not need to be able to understand what the vox is saying, but does need to be able to hear the sound of the vox&#146;s voice (for instance, this ability cannot be used if either the vox or his target is in an area of magical silence). Otherwise, the vox&#146;s compelling voice has the effects of the standard mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, and it gains further benefits as normal from abilities like the painful stare and bold stare class features.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Most mesmerists practice their mental manipulation through their entrancing gaze, but others have learned to practice their skill through the lilt and intonation of their voice. From sibilant whispers to overwhelming imprecations that resonate with the force of pure will, a vox unleashes the power of his mind with every silken syllable and shattering shout.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p>A vox adds the following spells to his class list: 1st&#151;ear-piercing screamUM; 2nd&#151; cacophonous callAPG, disrupt silenceUI, distracting cacophonyUM, piercing shriekUM, sonic screamACG; 4th&#151;shout, sonic thrustUM, wall of soundUM; 5th&#151;cacophonous call (mass) APG, echolocationUM, resonating wordUM; 6th&#151; magnifying chimeACG, shout (greater), sonic formACG. Unlike most psychic spells, a vox&#146;s mesmerist spells use both thought and verbal components; like a bard, a vox cannot remove the verbal components of his spells.</p>
			<p><b>Compelling Voice (Su): </b>A vox can focus the sound of his voice on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action, sapping that target&#146;s willpower and rendering her more vulnerable to mind-affecting powers, rather than using a stare like other mesmerists. A vox can use his compelling voice even while deafened, but it has a 20% chance to fail, just like casting a spell with a verbal component. The target does not need to be able to understand what the vox is saying, but does need to be able to hear the sound of the vox&#146;s voice (for instance, this ability cannot be used if either the vox or his target is in an area of magical silence). Otherwise, the vox&#146;s compelling voice has the effects of the standard mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, and it gains further benefits as normal from abilities like the painful stare and bold stare class features.</p>
			<p><b>Consummate Liar: </b>A mesmerist adds 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Bluff checks. In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesn&#146;t have Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of at least 13. He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater Feint.</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su): </b>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Painful Stare (Su): </b>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>
			<p><b>Towering Ego (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a mesmerist gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 0) on Will saving throws. If the mesmerist is under any effect that would prevent him from providing the emotional component of psychic spells (see page 144), he loses this bonus on saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Bold Stare (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can&#146;t be changed later. The mesmerist can&#146;t choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist&#146;s bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Wounding Words (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a vox can focus the power of his voice to magnify the force of his blows in melee. As a standard action, a vox can make a melee touch attack that deals 1d6 points of sonic damage plus 1 point per mesmerist level. Alternatively, he can make a single attack with a melee weapon as a standard action, adding the listed sonic damage to the damage dealt by his weapon on a successful attack. He can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. If the target of the vox&#146;s wounding words is also the target of his compelling voice, that creature must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vox&#146;s mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier) or take a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for 1 round. This penalty doesn&#146;t stack with the effects of the Concussive SpellUM metamagic feat.</p>
			<p><b>Manifold Tricks (Su): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can have two tricks implanted at a time. The number of concurrent tricks increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he possesses beyond 5th. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist&#146;s tricks).</p>
			<p><b>Mental Potency (Ex): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment or illusion spell he casts increase by 1. For enchantment and illusion spells he casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be). For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>
			<p><b>Subsonic Strike (Su): </b>At 10th level, a vox is able to unleash a deadly flurry of his wounding words as a standard action. He can target a number of creatures or objects equal to his Charisma modifier (minimum 1) within 30 feet, requiring a ranged touch attack against each target. If the target of his compelling voice is within 30 feet, he can choose to instead target only that creature with a single ranged touch or melee touch attack, dealing double normal damage on a successful attack. Whatever choice he makes, the vox must expend one use of wounding words.</p>
			<p><b>Glib Lie (Su): </b>At 11th level, a mesmerist can deceive truthdetecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the mesmerist&#146;s class level to succeed (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn&#146;t detect the mesmerist&#146;s lies or force him to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the mesmerist the glibness spell&#146;s bonus on Bluff checks.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>Rule Minds (Su): </b>At 20th level, a mesmerist can permanently mentally enslave a creature. When the mesmerist successfully affects the target of his hypnotic stare with an enchantment spell that requires a saving throw, he can force that creature to attempt a second Will saving throw with a DC equal to the spell&#146;s DC. The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn&#146;t a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can&#146;t be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>

					<p>At 2nd level, the vizier can use his mesmerist powers to make it seem like he is just a hanger-on who isn&#146;t contributing to a combat or social situation. This includes making it seem like one of his allies is casting his spells instead. When the vizier casts a spell, once the vizier&#146;s spell is complete, a glamer subtly alters onlookers&#146; memories and perception of the spell&#146;s casting such that all the usual manifestations of the spell indicate that the caster was one of the vizier&#146;s allies with an implanted trick. Creatures who observed the spellcasting can attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vizier&#146;s mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier) to disbelieve the glamer. Since this effect only comes into play after the spell&#146;s casting is complete, any attempts to ready an action against the spellcasting, counterspell, or take attacks of opportunity still work as normal. This ability does not prevent or otherwise hinder creatures from correctly targeting such attacks and abilities against the vizier (for instance, a creature readying an action to shoot an arrow to interrupt the spellcasting would still shoot the vizier). Additionally, when the vizier triggers an ally&#146;s implanted trick, flashy effects make it appear as if the ally was using an activated ability of her own.</p>
					<p>At 5th level, the vizier doesn&#146;t provoke attacks of opportunity when using power behind the throne, as if under the effects of a constant illusion of calmUC. A creature that disbelieves this second effect becomes immune to that vizier&#146;s illusion of calm for 24 hours.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level, the mesmerist can help allies shake off harmful conditions&#151;especially those that affect their minds&#151;by channeling psychic energy through his healing hands.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>While many mesmerists focus on beguiling their foes or taking overt control of others with their mental powers, viziers carve out a subtler niche for themselves as advisors. An adventuring vizier is delighted that enemies focus on the raging barbarian or spell-slinging wizard first, not realizing the threat posed by the vizier until it&#146;s too late.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Mesmerist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su): </b>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Insidious Influence (Su): </b>A vizier subtly influences his allies and others who trust him, making it more likely they will follow his suggestions. Allies with mesmerist tricks implanted by the vizier take penalties on Will saves made to resist the vizier&#146;s abilities and spells, and on Diplomacy, Intimidate, Sense Motive checks attempted against the vizier. This penalty equals that imposed by the vizier&#146;s hypnotic stare. If the vizier uses his hypnotic stare against such an ally, these penalties stack.</p>
			<p>At 3rd level, the vizier automatically gains the susceptibility bold stare improvement, and it also applies to the DCs of any influence check to manipulate the target (even if it isn&#146;t Diplomacy or Intimidate).</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Painful Stare (Su): </b>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>
			<p><b>Power Behind the Throne (Su): </b>At 2nd level, the vizier can use his mesmerist powers to make it seem like he is just a hanger-on who isn&#146;t contributing to a combat or social situation. This includes making it seem like one of his allies is casting his spells instead. When the vizier casts a spell, once the vizier&#146;s spell is complete, a glamer subtly alters onlookers&#146; memories and perception of the spell&#146;s casting such that all the usual manifestations of the spell indicate that the caster was one of the vizier&#146;s allies with an implanted trick. Creatures who observed the spellcasting can attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vizier&#146;s mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier) to disbelieve the glamer. Since this effect only comes into play after the spell&#146;s casting is complete, any attempts to ready an action against the spellcasting, counterspell, or take attacks of opportunity still work as normal. This ability does not prevent or otherwise hinder creatures from correctly targeting such attacks and abilities against the vizier (for instance, a creature readying an action to shoot an arrow to interrupt the spellcasting would still shoot the vizier). Additionally, when the vizier triggers an ally&#146;s implanted trick, flashy effects make it appear as if the ally was using an activated ability of her own.</p>
			<p>At 5th level, the vizier doesn&#146;t provoke attacks of opportunity when using power behind the throne, as if under the effects of a constant illusion of calmUC. A creature that disbelieves this second effect becomes immune to that vizier&#146;s illusion of calm for 24 hours.</p>
			<p><b>Bold Stare (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can&#146;t be changed later. The mesmerist can&#146;t choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist&#146;s bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Touch Treatment (Su): </b>At 3rd level, the mesmerist can help allies shake off harmful conditions&#151;especially those that affect their minds&#151;by channeling psychic energy through his healing hands. He can use touch treatment a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the mesmerist uses it on himself ), and the mesmerist must be able to touch his target. He can remove one condition from one target each time he uses this ability. At 3rd level, he can remove any condition on the minor conditions list. At 6th level, he can remove any condition on the minor or moderate conditions list, and at 10th level, he can remove any condition on the minor, moderate, or greater conditions list.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Minor Conditions: </i>Fascinated, shaken.</li>
				<li><i>Moderate Conditions: </i>Confused, dazed, frightened, sickened.</li>
				<li><i>Greater Conditions: </i>Cowering, nauseated, panicked, stunned.</li>
			</list>
			<p>A 14th level, the mesmerist can instead expend one use of touch treatment to replicate the effects of break enchantment. This targets only one creature the mesmerist is touching and follows all other restrictions of touch treatment.</p>
			<p><b>Manifold Tricks (Su): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can have two tricks implanted at a time. The number of concurrent tricks increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he possesses beyond 5th. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist&#146;s tricks).</p>
			<p><b>Glib Lie (Su): </b>At 11th level, a mesmerist can deceive truthdetecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the mesmerist&#146;s class level to succeed (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn&#146;t detect the mesmerist&#146;s lies or force him to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the mesmerist the glibness spell&#146;s bonus on Bluff checks.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>Rule Minds (Su): </b>At 20th level, a mesmerist can permanently mentally enslave a creature. When the mesmerist successfully affects the target of his hypnotic stare with an enchantment spell that requires a saving throw, he can force that creature to attempt a second Will saving throw with a DC equal to the spell&#146;s DC. The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn&#146;t a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can&#146;t be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>

				<name type="string">Hypnotic Stare</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
					<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
					<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>While many mesmerists are called to embrace the art of deception, using their mind-binding powers to make their foes believe that even the most outrageous realities are actually true, others indulge in the various hijinks their power enables. These mesmerists are known as vexing tricksters.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Mesmerist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Consummate Trickster (Ex): </b>A vexing trickster gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Disguise, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth checks. This bonus increases by 1 at 4th level and every 3 mesmerist levels thereafter (maximum +6).</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su): </b>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Painful Stare (Su): </b>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>
			<p><b>Trickster&#146;s Ego (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a vexing trickster gains Combat Expertise as a bonus feat. If his Intelligence score is less than 13, his Intelligence counts as 13 for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites for combat feats.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a vexing trickster gains a trick feat as a bonus feat. He must meet the feat&#146;s prerequisites. At 10th level, he gains a second trick feat as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Bold Stare (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can&#146;t be changed later. The mesmerist can&#146;t choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist&#146;s bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Manifold Tricks (Su): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can have two tricks implanted at a time. The number of concurrent tricks increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he possesses beyond 5th. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist&#146;s tricks).</p>
			<p><b>Mental Potency (Ex): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment or illusion spell he casts increase by 1. For enchantment and illusion spells he casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be). For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>
			<p><b>Manifold Hijinks (Su): </b>At 6th level, the vexing trickster learns to implant multiple mesmerist tricks that have been modified by trick feats (henceforth called modified tricks) in his targets&#146; minds simultaneously. At 6th level, the vexing trickster can implant up to two modified mesmerist tricks in a single target simultaneously. At 14th level, he can implant up to three modified mesmerist tricks in a single target simultaneously. This ability doesn&#146;t allow a mesmerist to apply more than one trick feat to a single mesmerist trick at a time.</p>
			<p><b>Glib Lie (Su): </b>At 11th level, a mesmerist can deceive truthdetecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the mesmerist&#146;s class level to succeed (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn&#146;t detect the mesmerist&#146;s lies or force him to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the mesmerist the glibness spell&#146;s bonus on Bluff checks.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>Rule Minds (Su): </b>At 20th level, a mesmerist can permanently mentally enslave a creature. When the mesmerist successfully affects the target of his hypnotic stare with an enchantment spell that requires a saving throw, he can force that creature to attempt a second Will saving throw with a DC equal to the spell&#146;s DC. The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn&#146;t a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can&#146;t be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.</p>

The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
					<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level, each time a vexing daredevil successfully feints against a creature under the effect of her hypnotic stare, she also chooses one of her dazzling feint benefits to activate. Unless otherwise stated, a dazzling feint&#146;s benefit applies only on the vexing daredevil&#146;s next attack this round. She selects one dazzling feint at 3rd level and another every 4 levels thereafter. The DC for any saving throw against a dazzling feint&#146;s effect is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vexing daredevil&#146;s class level + her Charisma modifier. The vexing daredevil can&#146;t choose the same dazzling feint more than once.</p>
					<p>Blinding Strike: The vexing daredevil&#146;s weapon emits a bright flash of light into the opponent&#146;s eyes. If the vexing daredevil&#146;s next attack hits, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be blinded for 1 round.</p>
					<p>Combat Maneuver: The vexing daredevil&#146;s attack patterns become more difficult to discern. The vexing daredevil chooses one combat maneuver when making this dazzling feint. For the rest of the round, she doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity when performing that combat maneuver against the target of her dazzling feint. This dazzling feint benefit applies on combat maneuvers instead of on the vexing daredevil&#146;s next attack.</p>

If her next attack is a critical threat against the target of this dazzling feint, the vexing daredevil gains a circumstance bonus on the roll to confirm that critical hit equal to +1 for every 3 mesmerist levels she possesses.</p>
					<p>Outmanuever: The vexing daredevil&#146;s darting movements foil the target&#146;s attempts to box her in. If her next attack hits, the vexing daredevil gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Acrobatics checks to move through the target&#146;s space or threatened area for 1 round. She can also move up to half her speed after the attack hits as a free action. If she wants to use Acrobatics to move through the target&#146;s threatened area or an enemy&#146;s space during this movement, she must reduce her speed or the DC of the Acrobatics check increases by 10, as normal.</p>
					<p>Piercing Strike: By psychically amplifying the target&#146;s pain, the vexing daredevil causes more damage. If she hits with her next attack and deals damage with her painful stare, she increases the damage dice from d6s to d8s.</p>
					<p>Sloppy Defense: The vexing daredevil&#146;s attacks effortlessly penetrate the target&#146;s defenses; she gains a +1 circumstance bonus on her next attack roll for every 5 mesmerist levels she possesses.</p>
					<p>Surprise Strike: The vexing daredevil creates an opening so she can squeeze in another strike. If her next attack hits, she can make another attack at her highest attack bonus &#150; 5 as a free action. The vexing daredevil must be at least 7th level to select this dazzling feint. This ability replaces bold stare.</p>

					<p>At 5th level, the mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment or illusion spell he casts increase by 1.

For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>

The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn&#146;t a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies.

If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Vexing daredevils train their psychic powers for combat, specializing in momentarily blinding and confusing their foes with sudden feints and tricks.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Mesmerist's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Consummate Liar: </b>A mesmerist adds 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Bluff checks. In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesn&#146;t have Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of at least 13. He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater Feint.</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su): </b>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Martial Weapon Proficiency (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a vexing daredevil picks one martial weapon and becomes proficient in its use. This ability replaces the 1st-level mesmerist trick.</p>
			<p><b>Painful Stare (Su): </b>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Towering Ego (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a mesmerist gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 0) on Will saving throws. If the mesmerist is under any effect that would prevent him from providing the emotional component of psychic spells (see page 144), he loses this bonus on saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Dazzling Feint (Su): </b>At 3rd level, each time a vexing daredevil successfully feints against a creature under the effect of her hypnotic stare, she also chooses one of her dazzling feint benefits to activate. Unless otherwise stated, a dazzling feint&#146;s benefit applies only on the vexing daredevil&#146;s next attack this round. She selects one dazzling feint at 3rd level and another every 4 levels thereafter. The DC for any saving throw against a dazzling feint&#146;s effect is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vexing daredevil&#146;s class level + her Charisma modifier. The vexing daredevil can&#146;t choose the same dazzling feint more than once.</p>
			<p><i>Blinding Strike </i>: The vexing daredevil&#146;s weapon emits a bright flash of light into the opponent&#146;s eyes. If the vexing daredevil&#146;s next attack hits, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be blinded for 1 round.</p>
			<p><i>Combat Maneuver </i>: The vexing daredevil&#146;s attack patterns become more difficult to discern. The vexing daredevil chooses one combat maneuver when making this dazzling feint. For the rest of the round, she doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity when performing that combat maneuver against the target of her dazzling feint. This dazzling feint benefit applies on combat maneuvers instead of on the vexing daredevil&#146;s next attack.</p>
			<p><i>Critical Strike </i>: Ever alert, the vexing daredevil hones in on the target&#146;s weak points. If her next attack is a critical threat against the target of this dazzling feint, the vexing daredevil gains a circumstance bonus on the roll to confirm that critical hit equal to +1 for every 3 mesmerist levels she possesses.</p>
			<p><i>Outmanuever: </i>The vexing daredevil&#146;s darting movements foil the target&#146;s attempts to box her in. If her next attack hits, the vexing daredevil gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Acrobatics checks to move through the target&#146;s space or threatened area for 1 round. She can also move up to half her speed after the attack hits as a free action. If she wants to use Acrobatics to move through the target&#146;s threatened area or an enemy&#146;s space during this movement, she must reduce her speed or the DC of the Acrobatics check increases by 10, as normal.</p>
			<p><i>Piercing Strike: </i>By psychically amplifying the target&#146;s pain, the vexing daredevil causes more damage. If she hits with her next attack and deals damage with her painful stare, she increases the damage dice from d6s to d8s.</p>
			<p><i>Sloppy Defense: </i>The vexing daredevil&#146;s attacks effortlessly penetrate the target&#146;s defenses; she gains a +1 circumstance bonus on her next attack roll for every 5 mesmerist levels she possesses.</p>
			<p><i>Surprise Strike: </i>The vexing daredevil creates an opening so she can squeeze in another strike. If her next attack hits, she can make another attack at her highest attack bonus &#150; 5 as a free action. The vexing daredevil must be at least 7th level to select this dazzling feint. This ability replaces bold stare.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feats: </b>A vexing daredevil gains Improved Feint as a bonus feat at 3rd level, Greater Feint as a bonus feat at 6th level, and Greater Mesmerizing Feint* as a bonus feat at 10th level. She doesn&#146;t need to meet the prerequisites for these feats. At 14th level, she gains a bonus stare feat; she must meet the prerequisites of that feat. These bonus feats replace touch treatment.</p>
			<p><b>Manifold Tricks (Su): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can have two tricks implanted at a time. The number of concurrent tricks increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he possesses beyond 5th. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist&#146;s tricks).</p>
			<p><b>Mental Potency (Ex): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment or illusion spell he casts increase by 1. For enchantment and illusion spells he casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be). For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>
			<p><b>Shimmering Body (Sp): </b>At 11th level, when a vexing daredevil moves in a round, until the beginning of her next turn, any target of her hypnotic stare sees her as a constantly shimmering form of light and treats her as if she were under a blur spell. This ability replaces glib tongue.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>Rule Minds (Su): </b>At 20th level, a mesmerist can permanently mentally enslave a creature. When the mesmerist successfully affects the target of his hypnotic stare with an enchantment spell that requires a saving throw, he can force that creature to attempt a second Will saving throw with a DC equal to the spell&#146;s DC. The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn&#146;t a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can&#146;t be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>

				<name type="string">Hypnotic Stare</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>

				<name type="string">Shadow Summoning</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>An umbral mesmerist gains the ability to summon quasi-real creatures as per summon monster I a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. The umbral mesmerist can use this ability as a standard action, and the creatures remain for 1 minute per level (instead of 1 round per level). The creatures summoned are only partly real, but have normal effects unless a creature affected by the illusion succeeds at a Will save to disbelieve (as per shadow conjuration.) The DC for this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the umbral mesmerist&#146;s mesmerist level + the umbral mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier. This is an illusion with the shadowUM descriptor.</p>
					<p>A shadow creature has half the hit points of a normal creature of its kind (regardless of whether it is recognized as a shadow creature). It deals the normal amount of damage and has all of the base creature&#146;s normal abilities and weaknesses. Against a creature that recognizes it as a shadow creature, however, the shadow creature&#146;s damage is halved, and all special abilities that do not deal lethal damage are only 50% likely to work. (Roll for each use and each affected character separately.) Furthermore, the shadow creature&#146;s AC bonuses are halved. A creature that succeeds at its save to disbelieve sees the summoned creature as transparent images superimposed on vague, shadowy forms. Objects automatically succeed at their Will saves against this spell. The umbral mesmerist cannot use this ability to summon creatures from more than one summon monster spell in this way at one time.</p>
					<p>At 4th level and every 4 mesmerist levels thereafter, the power of this ability increases by 1 spell level, allowing the umbral mesmerist to summon more powerful creatures (to a maximum of summon monster VI at 20th level). This ability replaces the mesmerist tricks gained at 1st, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th levels.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
					<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
					<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Trained in secret, umbral mesmerists are clandestine weapons who spend years learning how to shape terrifying creatures from the inky darkness in which they revel.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Mesmerist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Consummate Liar: </b>A mesmerist adds 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Bluff checks. In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesn&#146;t have Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of at least 13. He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater Feint.</p>
			<p><b>Diminished Spellcasting: </b>An umbral mesmerist can cast one fewer spell of each level than normal. If this reduces the number of spells for a level to 0, he can cast spells of that level only if his Charisma score allows bonus spells of that level. This ability alters the mesmerist&#146;s spellcasting.</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su): </b>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Shadow Summoning (Sp): </b>An umbral mesmerist gains the ability to summon quasi-real creatures as per summon monster I a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. The umbral mesmerist can use this ability as a standard action, and the creatures remain for 1 minute per level (instead of 1 round per level). The creatures summoned are only partly real, but have normal effects unless a creature affected by the illusion succeeds at a Will save to disbelieve (as per shadow conjuration.) The DC for this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the umbral mesmerist&#146;s mesmerist level + the umbral mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier. This is an illusion with the shadowUM descriptor.</p>
			<p>A shadow creature has half the hit points of a normal creature of its kind (regardless of whether it is recognized as a shadow creature). It deals the normal amount of damage and has all of the base creature&#146;s normal abilities and weaknesses. Against a creature that recognizes it as a shadow creature, however, the shadow creature&#146;s damage is halved, and all special abilities that do not deal lethal damage are only 50% likely to work. (Roll for each use and each affected character separately.) Furthermore, the shadow creature&#146;s AC bonuses are halved. A creature that succeeds at its save to disbelieve sees the summoned creature as transparent images superimposed on vague, shadowy forms. Objects automatically succeed at their Will saves against this spell. The umbral mesmerist cannot use this ability to summon creatures from more than one summon monster spell in this way at one time.</p>
			<p>At 4th level and every 4 mesmerist levels thereafter, the power of this ability increases by 1 spell level, allowing the umbral mesmerist to summon more powerful creatures (to a maximum of summon monster VI at 20th level). This ability replaces the mesmerist tricks gained at 1st, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Painful Stare (Su): </b>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>
			<p><b>Umbral Solipsism (Su): </b>At 2nd level, when a creature attempts a Will save to disbelieve a quasireal creature created by shadow summoning, it takes a penalty on the save equal to the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier (minimum 0). This ability replaces towering ego.</p>
			<p><b>Bold Stare (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can&#146;t be changed later. The mesmerist can&#146;t choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist&#146;s bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Touch Treatment (Su): </b>At 3rd level, the mesmerist can help allies shake off harmful conditions&#151;especially those that affect their minds&#151;by channeling psychic energy through his healing hands. He can use touch treatment a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the mesmerist uses it on himself ), and the mesmerist must be able to touch his target. He can remove one condition from one target each time he uses this ability. At 3rd level, he can remove any condition on the minor conditions list. At 6th level, he can remove any condition on the minor or moderate conditions list, and at 10th level, he can remove any condition on the minor, moderate, or greater conditions list.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Minor Conditions: </i>Fascinated, shaken.</li>
				<li><i>Moderate Conditions: </i>Confused, dazed, frightened, sickened.</li>
				<li><i>Greater Conditions: </i>Cowering, nauseated, panicked, stunned.</li>
			</list>
			<p>A 14th level, the mesmerist can instead expend one use of touch treatment to replicate the effects of break enchantment. This targets only one creature the mesmerist is touching and follows all other restrictions of touch treatment.</p>
			<p><b>Manifold Tricks (Su): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can have two tricks implanted at a time. The number of concurrent tricks increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he possesses beyond 5th. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist&#146;s tricks).</p>
			<p><b>Ephemeral Stare (Su): </b>At 5th level, the umbral mesmerist is treated as if he were invisible by the target of his hypnotic stare (as per the invisibility spell), provided neither he nor any creatures conjured by shadow summoning take hostile actions against the target. Once the umbral mesmerist or any creature conjured by his shadow summoning ability takes a hostile action against the target, the mesmerist becomes visible to the target and the target cannot be affected again by that umbral mesmerist&#146;s ephemeral stare ability for 24 hours (although it can be affected by other effects of his hypnotic stare). This ability replaces mental potency.</p>
			<p><b>Glib Lie (Su): </b>At 11th level, a mesmerist can deceive truthdetecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the mesmerist&#146;s class level to succeed (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn&#146;t detect the mesmerist&#146;s lies or force him to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the mesmerist the glibness spell&#146;s bonus on Bluff checks.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>Rule Minds (Su): </b>At 20th level, a mesmerist can permanently mentally enslave a creature. When the mesmerist successfully affects the target of his hypnotic stare with an enchantment spell that requires a saving throw, he can force that creature to attempt a second Will saving throw with a DC equal to the spell&#146;s DC. The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn&#146;t a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can&#146;t be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>

				<name type="string">Injections</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, the toxitician uses his skill with alchemy and his own psychic powers to create injections. The toxitician can create a number of injections per day equal to his mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier. It takes 1 hour to create the injections. An injection is inert until the toxitician attempts to use it, taking a swift action to infuse it with his psychic power to activate it.</p>
					<p>Using an injection requires taking a standard action to attempt a melee touch attack. If the attack hits, the target of an injection takes a &#150;2 penalty on its Will saving throws for a number of minutes equal to 1/2 the toxitican&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The penalty becomes &#150;3 at 8th level. The toxitician can simultaneously attempt a DC 20 Sleight of Hand check to inject the target surreptitiously. If the toxitician uses Sleight of Hand, the target can attempt a Perception check to detect the attempt, opposed by the Sleight of Hand check result, but detecting the attempt doesn&#146;t prevent the creature from being injected. Whenever the toxitician uses Sleight of Hand to administer one of his injections, he can implant it rather than injecting it and then trigger the effect of the injection at a later time. At any point before he regains his injections, the toxitician can trigger an implanted injection as a free action. The toxitician must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per mesmerist level) of the target of the implanted injection.</p>
					<p>If either the melee touch attack or the Sleight of Hand check (if attempted) fails, the injection isn&#146;t delivered but can still be used again&#151;once activated, it remains potent for 1 day. An injection that hasn&#146;t been administered becomes inert if it leaves the toxitician&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping.</p>
					<p>The penalties from multiple injections don&#146;t stack, nor do the penalties from injections stack with penalties from mesmerist stares or witches&#146; evil eye hexes. Injections are mind-affecting effects.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
					<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
					<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate.

He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
					<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Toxiticians forgo the mesmerist&#146;s stare, instead combining their psychic power with their alchemical knowledge to craft injections that torment their foes and bolster themselves and their allies.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>

			<p>The Mesmerist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Deft Fingers (Ex): </b>A toxitician adds 1/2 his class level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Sleight of Hands checks. This ability replaces consummate liar.</p>
			<p><b>Injections (Su): </b>At 1st level, the toxitician uses his skill with alchemy and his own psychic powers to create injections. The toxitician can create a number of injections per day equal to his mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier. It takes 1 hour to create the injections. An injection is inert until the toxitician attempts to use it, taking a swift action to infuse it with his psychic power to activate it.</p>
			<p>Using an injection requires taking a standard action to attempt a melee touch attack. If the attack hits, the target of an injection takes a &#150;2 penalty on its Will saving throws for a number of minutes equal to 1/2 the toxitican&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The penalty becomes &#150;3 at 8th level. The toxitician can simultaneously attempt a DC 20 Sleight of Hand check to inject the target surreptitiously. If the toxitician uses Sleight of Hand, the target can attempt a Perception check to detect the attempt, opposed by the Sleight of Hand check result, but detecting the attempt doesn&#146;t prevent the creature from being injected. Whenever the toxitician uses Sleight of Hand to administer one of his injections, he can implant it rather than injecting it and then trigger the effect of the injection at a later time. At any point before he regains his injections, the toxitician can trigger an implanted injection as a free action. The toxitician must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per mesmerist level) of the target of the implanted injection.</p>
			<p>If either the melee touch attack or the Sleight of Hand check (if attempted) fails, the injection isn&#146;t delivered but can still be used again&#151;once activated, it remains potent for 1 day. An injection that hasn&#146;t been administered becomes inert if it leaves the toxitician&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping.</p>
			<p>The penalties from multiple injections don&#146;t stack, nor do the penalties from injections stack with penalties from mesmerist stares or witches&#146; evil eye hexes. Injections are mind-affecting effects.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Painful Injection (Su): </b>The toxitician&#146;s injection causes intense pain. This increases the damage the subject takes in the same way as the mesmerist&#146;s painful stare class feature. This extra damage is dealt automatically, without being triggered by the toxitician, but doesn&#146;t increase when the toxitician damages the target and can still be dealt only once per round. This ability replaces painful stare.</p>
			<p><b>Towering Ego (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a mesmerist gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 0) on Will saving throws. If the mesmerist is under any effect that would prevent him from providing the emotional component of psychic spells (see page 144), he loses this bonus on saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Injection Improvement (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a toxitician can select one improvement to add to his injections. The toxitician can&#146;t choose the same improvement more than once. The toxitician doesn&#146;t have to select the improvements when he prepares his injections at the start of the day; the choice is made as part of the swift action to activate the injection. The target can attempt a Fortitude saving throw to resist an injection with an improvement added to it. The DC is 10 + 1/2 the toxitician&#146;s class level + the toxitician&#146;s Charisma modifier. On a successful save, the target still takes the penalty on its Will saving throws, but not the effects of the improvement. A toxitician can, as a free action, sacrifice one use of his injections to increase the DC of another injection by 2.</p>
			<p>Ability Decrease: The target takes a &#150;2 penalty to one ability score of the toxitician&#146;s choosing. At 11th level, the penalty becomes &#150;4.</p>
			<p>Excruciating: The extra damage from painful injection increases by an amount equal to 2 points + 1 point per 3 mesmerist levels the toxitician possesses.</p>
			<p>Fortitude Decrease: The target&#146;s immune system weakens, imposing a &#150;2 penalty on Fortitude saving throws. At 11th level, the penalty becomes &#150;4.</p>
			<p>Natural Armor Decrease: The target&#146;s skin becomes looser, decreasing its natural armor (if any) by 2. At 11th level, its natural armor bonus instead decreases by 4.</p>
			<p>Reflex Decrease: The target&#146;s body becomes stiffer, imposing a &#150;2 penalty on the target&#146;s Reflex saving throws. At 11th level, the penalty becomes &#150;4.</p>
			<p>Slow: The target&#146;s actions become sluggish, reducing its base movement by 10 feet and imposing a &#150;1 penalty on attack rolls. At 11th level, the penalty on attack rolls becomes &#150;2.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces bold stare.</p>
			<p><b>Touch Treatment (Su): </b>At 3rd level, the mesmerist can help allies shake off harmful conditions&#151;especially those that affect their minds&#151;by channeling psychic energy through his healing hands. He can use touch treatment a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the mesmerist uses it on himself ), and the mesmerist must be able to touch his target. He can remove one condition from one target each time he uses this ability. At 3rd level, he can remove any condition on the minor conditions list. At 6th level, he can remove any condition on the minor or moderate conditions list, and at 10th level, he can remove any condition on the minor, moderate, or greater conditions list.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Minor Conditions: </i>Fascinated, shaken.</li>
				<li><i>Moderate Conditions: </i>Confused, dazed, frightened, sickened.</li>
				<li><i>Greater Conditions: </i>Cowering, nauseated, panicked, stunned.</li>
			</list>
			<p>A 14th level, the mesmerist can instead expend one use of touch treatment to replicate the effects of break enchantment. This targets only one creature the mesmerist is touching and follows all other restrictions of touch treatment.</p>
			<p><b>Treatment Vials (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a toxitician can create treatment vials when he creates his injections for the day; creating each treatment vial expends one use of touch treatment. A treatment vial has the same benefit as his touch treatment, but anyone can administer it as a standard action. A vial can remove any condition the toxitician is able to remove at his mesmerist level, but can&#146;t be used for a break enchantment effect. A treatment vial becomes inert after 24 hours. This ability alters touch treatment.</p>
			<p><b>Manifold Tricks (Su): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can have two tricks implanted at a time. The number of concurrent tricks increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he possesses beyond 5th. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist&#146;s tricks).</p>
			<p><b>Mental Potency (Ex): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment or illusion spell he casts increase by 1. For enchantment and illusion spells he casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be). For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Injections (Su): </b>At 11th level, the toxitician can add two different improvements to an injection. The injection still requires only one save. This ability replaces glib lie.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>Rule Minds (Su): </b>At 20th level, a mesmerist can permanently mentally enslave a creature. When the mesmerist successfully affects the target of his hypnotic stare with an enchantment spell that requires a saving throw, he can force that creature to attempt a second Will saving throw with a DC equal to the spell&#146;s DC. The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn&#146;t a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can&#146;t be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.</p>

				<name type="string">Hypnotic Stare</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>

					<p>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
					<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
					<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>

					<p>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Mesmerists that learn to pierce deep into the minds of their victims are known as thought eaters, dangerous individuals capable of devouring thoughts and assuming the knowledge those notions represent for themselves.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Mesmerist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Assume Identity (Su): </b>When a thought eater targets a creature with his hypnotic stare ability, the thought eater gains a bonus on Disguise checks to appear as that creature. This bonus is equal to the thought eater&#146;s mesmerist level, and lasts for 24 hours, or until he uses his hypnotic stare ability on a different creature.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces consummate liar.</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su): </b>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Painful Stare (Su): </b>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>
			<p><b>Assume Morality (Su): </b>At 2nd level, the thought eater&#146;s alignment matches that of the target of his assume identity ability for the purposes of spells and effects that discern alignment. This includes any increase to alignment aura strength from class features, such as a cleric&#146;s aura ability.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces towering ego.</p>
			<p><b>Bold Stare (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can&#146;t be changed later. The mesmerist can&#146;t choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist&#146;s bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Assume Knowledge (Su): </b>At 3rd level, the thought eater can choose one Knowledge skill possessed by the target of his hypnotic stare. He uses the target&#146;s number of ranks in that skill, instead of his own, to calculate his bonus (but not for other purposes, such as meeting the prerequisites of feats) to a maximum number of ranks equal to his mesmerist level. This ability lasts for 24 hours or until he uses his hypnotic stare ability on a different creature.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces touch treatment.</p>
			<p><b>Manifold Tricks (Su): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can have two tricks implanted at a time. The number of concurrent tricks increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he possesses beyond 5th. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist&#146;s tricks).</p>
			<p><b>Mental Potency (Ex): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment or illusion spell he casts increase by 1. For enchantment and illusion spells he casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be). For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>
			<p><b>Glib Lie (Su): </b>At 11th level, a mesmerist can deceive truthdetecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the mesmerist&#146;s class level to succeed (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn&#146;t detect the mesmerist&#146;s lies or force him to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the mesmerist the glibness spell&#146;s bonus on Bluff checks.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>Consume Identity (Su): </b>At 20th level, when the thought eater kills a target of his hypnotic stare, he can choose to entirely consume the creature&#146;s identity, mind, body, and soul as a free action. The target&#146;s corpse dissolves and as long as the thought eater lives, the target of consume identity cannot be brought back from the dead until the thought eater releases the identity (a standard action) or uses consume identity on another target. The creature&#146;s soul can also be released by a wish or miracle (which ends the effect of consume identity). When the thought eater has consumed an identity, all divination spells identify him as (and consider him to be) the creature whose identity he consumed rather than himself. This ability fools any spell short of discern location. Discern location pinpoints the thought eater&#146;s location, whenever either the thought eater or the consumed creature is the target of that spell.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces rule minds.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
					<p>A spirit walker adds additional spells to his spell list at the spell levels indicated: hide from undead (1st), command undead (2nd), halt undead (3rd), and speak with hauntACG (4th). He can choose these as spells known, but doesn&#146;t gain them automatically. This ability alters the mesmerist&#146;s spell list.</p>

				<name type="string">Undead Inception</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a spirit walker can affect undead creatures with his hypnotic stare as the psychic inception bold stare ability. This allows him to affect only undead; he must actually choose the psychic inception bold stare improvement if he wants to also affect other mindless creatures. At 3rd level when the spirit walker uses this ability, undead targets don&#146;t receive a saving throw bonus (if they did to begin with), have only a 25% chance of ignoring the spirit walker&#146;s mind-affecting spells and abilities, and no longer need to be under the spirit walker&#146;s gaze to be affected. At 5th level, when the spirit walker uses his mind-affecting spells and abilities, they affect all undead normally, with no chance of failure. This ability replaces consummate liar and mental potency.</p>

				<name type="string">Hypnotic Stare</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>

					<p>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
					<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
					<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>

				<name type="string">Mesmerist Trick</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
					<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
					<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>

				<name type="string">Painful Stare</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level, when a spirit walker is using hypnotic stare on a humanoid target and the target dies, as an immediate action the spirit walker can force the target&#146;s soul to remain in the body. The spirit walker can then control the target as if using dominate person for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 the spirit walker&#146;s class level. The creature gains a number of temporary hit points equal to 2 &#215; the spirit walker&#146;s class level and continues acting as though it were alive and conscious until it loses those temporary hit points or the duration expires. During this time, the creature counts as undead, but it can&#146;t be healed by negative energy. The spirit walker can use this ability once per day for every 3 mesmerist levels he possesses. The target receives a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the spirit walker&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier) to avoid this effect and die normally. This ability ends immediately if at any point the target&#146;s body is completely destroyed (such as by disintegrate) or restored to life. At 14th level, the spirit walker can apply this ability to any type of target as if using dominate monster. This ability replaces the 3rd- and 14th-level touch treatments.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some mesmerists specialize in dominating and controlling undead rather than the living.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Mesmerist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p>A spirit walker adds additional spells to his spell list at the spell levels indicated: hide from undead (1st), command undead (2nd), halt undead (3rd), and speak with haunt (4th). He can choose these as spells known, but doesn&#146;t gain them automatically. This ability alters the mesmerist&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su): </b>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Painful Stare (Su): </b>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>
			<p><b>Undead Inception (Su): </b>At 1st level, a spirit walker can affect undead creatures with his hypnotic stare as the psychic inception bold stare ability. This allows him to affect only undead; he must actually choose the psychic inception bold stare improvement if he wants to also affect other mindless creatures. At 3rd level when the spirit walker uses this ability, undead targets don&#146;t receive a saving throw bonus (if they did to begin with), have only a 25% chance of ignoring the spirit walker&#146;s mind-affecting spells and abilities, and no longer need to be under the spirit walker&#146;s gaze to be affected. At 5th level, when the spirit walker uses his mind-affecting spells and abilities, they affect all undead normally, with no chance of failure. This ability replaces consummate liar and mental potency.</p>
			<p><b>Towering Ego (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a mesmerist gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 0) on Will saving throws. If the mesmerist is under any effect that would prevent him from providing the emotional component of psychic spells (see page 144), he loses this bonus on saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Bold Stare (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can&#146;t be changed later. The mesmerist can&#146;t choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist&#146;s bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Continued Animation (Su): </b>At 3rd level, when a spirit walker is using hypnotic stare on a humanoid target and the target dies, as an immediate action the spirit walker can force the target&#146;s soul to remain in the body. The spirit walker can then control the target as if using dominate person for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 the spirit walker&#146;s class level. The creature gains a number of temporary hit points equal to 2 &#215; the spirit walker&#146;s class level and continues acting as though it were alive and conscious until it loses those temporary hit points or the duration expires. During this time, the creature counts as undead, but it can&#146;t be healed by negative energy. The spirit walker can use this ability once per day for every 3 mesmerist levels he possesses. The target receives a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the spirit walker&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier) to avoid this effect and die normally. This ability ends immediately if at any point the target&#146;s body is completely destroyed (such as by disintegrate) or restored to life. At 14th level, the spirit walker can apply this ability to any type of target as if using dominate monster. This ability replaces the 3rd- and 14th-level touch treatments.</p>
			<p><b>Manifold Tricks (Su): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can have two tricks implanted at a time. The number of concurrent tricks increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he possesses beyond 5th. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist&#146;s tricks).</p>
			<p><b>Command Undead (Su): </b>At 6th level, a spirit walker gains Command Undead as a bonus feat. A spirit walker can use Command Undead a number of times per day equal to 1 + his Charisma modifier (minimum 1), using his mesmerist level as his cleric level. At 10th level, the DC to resist this effect increases by 2. This ability replaces the 6th- and 10th-level touch treatments.</p>
			<p><b>Glib Lie (Su): </b>At 11th level, a mesmerist can deceive truthdetecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the mesmerist&#146;s class level to succeed (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn&#146;t detect the mesmerist&#146;s lies or force him to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the mesmerist the glibness spell&#146;s bonus on Bluff checks.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>Master of the Dead (Su): </b>At 20th level, a spirit walker gains mastery of the undead. Once per day, a spirit walker can use control undead as a spell-like ability on one target. If that creature fails its saving throw and has 20 or fewer Hit Dice, it falls permanently under the spirit walker&#146;s control until the spirit walker dies. A creature that fails its save but has more than 20 HD suffers the effect of command undead. A creature that succeeds at its save can&#146;t be affected by master of the dead for 24 hours. A spirit walker can control only one undead creature in this fashion at a time. If he permanently controls a new undead creature, the previous one is set free. This ability replaces rule minds.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
					<p>A projectionist&#146;s psychic powers manifest in an almost predictable manner, making them less versatile than other spellcasters. At each of the indicated levels, a projectionist must choose the indicated spell to learn&#151;he cannot choose other spells. The spells that a projectionist must learn (and the level at which he must choose them) are enter imageAPG(4th), lesser object possessionOA (7th), riding possessionOA (10th), object possessionOA (13th), and greater object possessionOA (16th). The projectionist adds greater object possession to his spell list as a 6th-level spell.</p>

				<name type="string">Hypnotic Stare</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, a projectionist can spend one use of his mesmerist trick ability to create a psychic link between himself and one object that bears his likeness, such as a painting or a statue. This functions in all ways like implanting a mesmerist trick in a creature, except the target is an object. The projectionist can trigger the trick as a standard action at any time&#151;upon doing so, his consciousness leaves his body and fills the target object, functioning as described by the &#147;filling an image with your consciousness&#148; use of the enter image spell (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&#146;s Guide 219). Use the projectionist&#146;s mesmerist level as the spell&#146;s caster level. While filling an image with his consciousness, the projectionist can use and maintain his hypnotic stare on opponents, and can also trigger his painful stare. At 8th level, he can also use any purely mental action (including casting psychic spells) while filling an object with his consciousness.</p>
					<p>Once he implants this trick in an object, the projectionist can fill the target with his consciousness whenever he pleases, regardless of distance or whether he is on the same plane as his target. Once he stops concentrating on maintaining the enter image effect, his consciousness returns to his body and he cannot fill the target with his consciousness again until he implants another mesmerist trick in that object.</p>
					<p>This ability replaces the mesmerist tricks gained at 4th and 8th levels.</p>

					<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
					<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>

				<name type="string">Painful Stare</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Not content to simply command others from afar, a projectionist is able to use his mesmerizing powers to utterly dominate other creatures and objects by projecting his spirit from his body.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Mesmerist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p>A projectionist&#146;s psychic powers manifest in an almost predictable manner, making them less versatile than other spellcasters. At each of the indicated levels, a projectionist must choose the indicated spell to learn&#151;he cannot choose other spells. The spells that a projectionist must learn (and the level at which he must choose them) are enter imageAPG(4th), lesser object possessionOA (7th), riding possessionOA (10th), object possessionOA (13th), and greater object possessionOA (16th). The projectionist adds greater object possession to his spell list as a 6th-level spell.</p>
			<p><b>Consummate Liar: </b>A mesmerist adds 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Bluff checks. In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesn&#146;t have Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of at least 13. He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater Feint.</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su): </b>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Painful Stare (Su): </b>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>
			<p><b>Towering Ego (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a mesmerist gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 0) on Will saving throws. If the mesmerist is under any effect that would prevent him from providing the emotional component of psychic spells (see page 144), he loses this bonus on saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Bold Stare (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can&#146;t be changed later. The mesmerist can&#146;t choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist&#146;s bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Touch Treatment (Su): </b>At 3rd level, the mesmerist can help allies shake off harmful conditions&#151;especially those that affect their minds&#151;by channeling psychic energy through his healing hands. He can use touch treatment a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the mesmerist uses it on himself ), and the mesmerist must be able to touch his target. He can remove one condition from one target each time he uses this ability. At 3rd level, he can remove any condition on the minor conditions list. At 6th level, he can remove any condition on the minor or moderate conditions list, and at 10th level, he can remove any condition on the minor, moderate, or greater conditions list.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Minor Conditions: </i>Fascinated, shaken.</li>
				<li><i>Moderate Conditions: </i>Confused, dazed, frightened, sickened.</li>
				<li><i>Greater Conditions: </i>Cowering, nauseated, panicked, stunned.</li>
			</list>
			<p>A 14th level, the mesmerist can instead expend one use of touch treatment to replicate the effects of break enchantment. This targets only one creature the mesmerist is touching and follows all other restrictions of touch treatment.</p>
			<p><b>Implant Consciousness (Su): </b>At 4th level, a projectionist can spend one use of his mesmerist trick ability to create a psychic link between himself and one object that bears his likeness, such as a painting or a statue. This functions in all ways like implanting a mesmerist trick in a creature, except the target is an object. The projectionist can trigger the trick as a standard action at any time&#151;upon doing so, his consciousness leaves his body and fills the target object, functioning as described by the &#147;filling an image with your consciousness&#148; use of the enter image spell (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&#146;s Guide 219). Use the projectionist&#146;s mesmerist level as the spell&#146;s caster level. While filling an image with his consciousness, the projectionist can use and maintain his hypnotic stare on opponents, and can also trigger his painful stare. At 8th level, he can also use any purely mental action (including casting psychic spells) while filling an object with his consciousness.</p>
			<p>Once he implants this trick in an object, the projectionist can fill the target with his consciousness whenever he pleases, regardless of distance or whether he is on the same plane as his target. Once he stops concentrating on maintaining the enter image effect, his consciousness returns to his body and he cannot fill the target with his consciousness again until he implants another mesmerist trick in that object.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the mesmerist tricks gained at 4th and 8th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Hidden Presence: </b>At 5th level, a projectionist gains Hidden PresenceOA as a bonus feat. He doesn&#146;t need to meet the feat&#146;s prerequisites. He benefits from Hidden Presence and feats that list Hidden Presence as a prerequisite while possessing objects (as with object possessionOA) or while filling an object with his consciousness (as described in the enter imageAPG spell), as well as when he possesses creatures, provided the feat is applicable. For instance, Intrusive PresenceOA cannot be used to read the mind of an inanimate object possessed via enter image or object possession, as objects possess no minds to be read.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the mesmerist&#146;s mental potency.</p>
			<p><b>Manifold Tricks (Su): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can have two tricks implanted at a time. The number of concurrent tricks increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he possesses beyond 5th. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist&#146;s tricks).</p>
			<p><b>Glib Lie (Su): </b>At 11th level, a mesmerist can deceive truthdetecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the mesmerist&#146;s class level to succeed (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn&#146;t detect the mesmerist&#146;s lies or force him to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the mesmerist the glibness spell&#146;s bonus on Bluff checks.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>Rule Minds (Su): </b>At 20th level, a mesmerist can permanently mentally enslave a creature. When the mesmerist successfully affects the target of his hypnotic stare with an enchantment spell that requires a saving throw, he can force that creature to attempt a second Will saving throw with a DC equal to the spell&#146;s DC. The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn&#146;t a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can&#146;t be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.</p>

				<name type="string">Phantasmagorical Breath</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a mindwyrm mesmer has learned to mimic a true dragon&#146;s destructive breath using his psychic ability. A number of times per day equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 1 per day), a mindwyrm mesmer can unleash his phantasmagoric breath in either a 30-foot cone or a 60-foot line as a standard action. The breath induces a psychosomatic response in creatures caught in the area, dealing 1d6 points of energy damage at 1st level, plus an additional 1d6 points of energy damage at 3rd level and for every 2 mesmerist levels thereafter. The mindwyrm mesmer selects the type of energy damage this deals (acid, cold, electricity, or fire) when this ability is first gained; once made, this choice can&#146;t be changed. Creatures affected can attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the mindwyrm mesmer&#146;s mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier) to realize the true nature of the attack, which negates all damage. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>

					<p>The following new masterful trick can be selected by a mindwyrm mesmer of 12th level or higher.</p>
					<p>Frightful Countenance: The subject&#146;s appearance changes into that which frightens an attacker to the core. The mindwyrm mesmer can trigger this trick when the subject is targeted by an attack or by a spell that requires an attack roll. The attacker must succeed at a Will save or the attack misses and the attacker immediately becomes shaken for 1d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>

					<p>At 5th level, the mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment or illusion spell he casts increase by 1. For enchantment and illusion spells he casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be). For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>

The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn&#146;t a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>While most mesmerists are subtle and manipulative schemers, mindwyrm mesmers emulate the confidence, swagger, and fear inspired by dragons to bully and browbeat others into obedience. These dragon-inspired psychic magic-users typically employ draconic imagery in their dress and the manifestations of their powers.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Mesmerist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Consummate Liar: </b>A mesmerist adds 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Bluff checks. In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesn&#146;t have Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of at least 13. He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater Feint.</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su): </b>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Draconic Trick (Su): </b>The following new trick can be selected by a mindwyrm mesmer.</p>
			<p><i>Threatening Mien: </i>The subject&#146;s actions appear to be lethal in the extreme. A mindwyrm mesmer can trigger this trick when the subject moves adjacent to an enemy. Enemies adjacent to the subject take a -4 penalty on attacks against targets other than the subject. This trick lasts for 1 round per mindwyrm mesmer&#146;s mesmerist level.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Painful Stare (Su): </b>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>
			<p><b>Towering Ego (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a mesmerist gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 0) on Will saving throws. If the mesmerist is under any effect that would prevent him from providing the emotional component of psychic spells (see page 144), he loses this bonus on saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Bold Stare (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can&#146;t be changed later. The mesmerist can&#146;t choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist&#146;s bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Touch Treatment (Su): </b>At 3rd level, the mesmerist can help allies shake off harmful conditions&#151;especially those that affect their minds&#151;by channeling psychic energy through his healing hands. He can use touch treatment a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the mesmerist uses it on himself ), and the mesmerist must be able to touch his target. He can remove one condition from one target each time he uses this ability. At 3rd level, he can remove any condition on the minor conditions list. At 6th level, he can remove any condition on the minor or moderate conditions list, and at 10th level, he can remove any condition on the minor, moderate, or greater conditions list.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Minor Conditions: </i>Fascinated, shaken.</li>
				<li><i>Moderate Conditions: </i>Confused, dazed, frightened, sickened.</li>
				<li><i>Greater Conditions: </i>Cowering, nauseated, panicked, stunned.</li>
			</list>
			<p>A 14th level, the mesmerist can instead expend one use of touch treatment to replicate the effects of break enchantment. This targets only one creature the mesmerist is touching and follows all other restrictions of touch treatment.</p>
			<p><b>Manifold Tricks (Su): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can have two tricks implanted at a time. The number of concurrent tricks increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he possesses beyond 5th. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist&#146;s tricks).</p>
			<p><b>Mental Potency (Ex): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment or illusion spell he casts increase by 1. For enchantment and illusion spells he casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be). For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>
			<p><b>Glib Lie (Su): </b>At 11th level, a mesmerist can deceive truthdetecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the mesmerist&#146;s class level to succeed (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn&#146;t detect the mesmerist&#146;s lies or force him to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the mesmerist the glibness spell&#146;s bonus on Bluff checks.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Draconic Trick (Su): </b>The following new masterful trick can be selected by a mindwyrm mesmer of 12th level or higher.</p>
			<p><i>Frightful Countenance: </i>The subject&#146;s appearance changes into that which frightens an attacker to the core. The mindwyrm mesmer can trigger this trick when the subject is targeted by an attack or by a spell that requires an attack roll. The attacker must succeed at a Will save or the attack misses and the attacker immediately becomes shaken for 1d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>Rule Minds (Su): </b>At 20th level, a mesmerist can permanently mentally enslave a creature. When the mesmerist successfully affects the target of his hypnotic stare with an enchantment spell that requires a saving throw, he can force that creature to attempt a second Will saving throw with a DC equal to the spell&#146;s DC. The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn&#146;t a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can&#146;t be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>

All illusion (glamer), illusion (shadow), and transmutation spells of 6th level and lower are considered to be part of the material manipulator&#146;s spell list. These are psychic spells.</p>
					<p>This ability alters the mesmerist&#146;s spellcasting and replaces consummate liar, the mesmerist trick gained at 2nd level, and manifold tricks.</p>

				<name type="string">Hypnotic Stare</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>

Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
					<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
					<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>

					<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>

				<name type="string">Painful Stare</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>

					<p>At 2nd level, a mesmerist gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 0) on Will saving throws. If the mesmerist is under any effect that would prevent him from providing the emotional component of psychic spells (see page 144), he loses this bonus on saving throws.</p>

				<name type="string">Revision</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 3rd level, a material manipulator can revise a creature&#146;s body to change its appearance. He can use revision a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Using revision is a standard action (or a swift action if the material manipulator uses it on himself ), and the material manipulator must be able to touch his target. An unwilling target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the material manipulator&#146;s mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier) to negate the effect.</p>
					<p>At 3rd level, the material manipulator can adjust the target&#146;s height and weight, increasing it or decreasing it to any height or weight within the standard range for creatures of the target&#146;s type and size category (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 169). At 6th level, he can adjust the target&#146;s gender, physical traits (such as nose size, fingernail length, and foot shape), and pigmentation (including eye, hair, and skin color) to any natural variation for creatures of the target&#146;s type (and heritage, if applicable). At 10th level, he can adjust the target&#146;s age, rewinding the target&#146;s age to as young as a young adult (approximately 8 years old for a human) or progressing it to as old as venerable. This causes the target to gain aging bonuses and penalties and adjust its size as appropriate for its new age, but doesn&#146;t confer any other benefits gained from aging (such as additional racial Hit Dice, supernatural abilities, and so on). At 14th level, he can adjust the target&#146;s type or subtype, as per polymorph. At 20th level, he can instead adjust the target&#146;s type as per greater polymorph. This ability is a polymorph effect, and the subject of a revision cannot end the effect early by any means unless the material manipulator permits it. The material manipulator can stack multiple adjustments from this ability into the same polymorph effect&#151;for instance, a 14th-level material manipulator can adjust himself into an orc, reduce his age to that of a young adult, give himself large feet and a bulbous nose, and change his gender.</p>
					<p>This effect lasts for 10 minutes per mesmerist level. At 10th level, the effect lasts for 1 hour per mesmerist level, or 1 minute per level if he uses it as polymorph. At 20th level, the effect lasts indefinitely, or 10 minutes per mesmerist level if the material manipulator uses it as greater polymorph and causes the target to assume a form with a different type than its true form. The mesmerist can dismiss this effect as a free action.</p>
					<p>Clothing and equipment worn by the target is not affected by this effect&#151;gear does not resize to suit the wearer&#146;s new form, nor does it merge into her body. Gear unable to be worn or wielded as a result of this effect falls to the ground in the wearer&#146;s space.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Rather than waste time limiting himself to ruling minds, a material manipulator forces his whims upon reality and uses his magic to ensure that those around him comply with his demands.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Mesmerist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su): </b>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Manipulator Spells: </b>A material manipulator casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list and augmented by a select list of sorcerer/wizard spells. All illusion (glamer), illusion (shadow), and transmutation spells of 6th level and lower are considered to be part of the material manipulator&#146;s spell list. These are psychic spells.</p>
			<p>This ability alters the mesmerist&#146;s spellcasting and replaces consummate liar, the mesmerist trick gained at 2nd level, and manifold tricks.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Painful Stare (Su): </b>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>
			<p><b>Towering Ego (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a mesmerist gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 0) on Will saving throws. If the mesmerist is under any effect that would prevent him from providing the emotional component of psychic spells (see page 144), he loses this bonus on saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Bold Stare (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can&#146;t be changed later. The mesmerist can&#146;t choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist&#146;s bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Revision (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a material manipulator can revise a creature&#146;s body to change its appearance. He can use revision a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Using revision is a standard action (or a swift action if the material manipulator uses it on himself ), and the material manipulator must be able to touch his target. An unwilling target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the material manipulator&#146;s mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier) to negate the effect.</p>
			<p>At 3rd level, the material manipulator can adjust the target&#146;s height and weight, increasing it or decreasing it to any height or weight within the standard range for creatures of the target&#146;s type and size category (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 169). At 6th level, he can adjust the target&#146;s gender, physical traits (such as nose size, fingernail length, and foot shape), and pigmentation (including eye, hair, and skin color) to any natural variation for creatures of the target&#146;s type (and heritage, if applicable). At 10th level, he can adjust the target&#146;s age, rewinding the target&#146;s age to as young as a young adult (approximately 8 years old for a human) or progressing it to as old as venerable. This causes the target to gain aging bonuses and penalties and adjust its size as appropriate for its new age, but doesn&#146;t confer any other benefits gained from aging (such as additional racial Hit Dice, supernatural abilities, and so on). At 14th level, he can adjust the target&#146;s type or subtype, as per polymorph. At 20th level, he can instead adjust the target&#146;s type as per greater polymorph. This ability is a polymorph effect, and the subject of a revision cannot end the effect early by any means unless the material manipulator permits it. The material manipulator can stack multiple adjustments from this ability into the same polymorph effect&#151;for instance, a 14th-level material manipulator can adjust himself into an orc, reduce his age to that of a young adult, give himself large feet and a bulbous nose, and change his gender.</p>
			<p>This effect lasts for 10 minutes per mesmerist level. At 10th level, the effect lasts for 1 hour per mesmerist level, or 1 minute per level if he uses it as polymorph. At 20th level, the effect lasts indefinitely, or 10 minutes per mesmerist level if the material manipulator uses it as greater polymorph and causes the target to assume a form with a different type than its true form. The mesmerist can dismiss this effect as a free action.</p>
			<p>Clothing and equipment worn by the target is not affected by this effect&#151;gear does not resize to suit the wearer&#146;s new form, nor does it merge into her body. Gear unable to be worn or wielded as a result of this effect falls to the ground in the wearer&#146;s space.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces touch treatment and rule minds.</p>
			<p><b>Mental Potency (Ex): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment or illusion spell he casts increase by 1. For enchantment and illusion spells he casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be). For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>
			<p><b>Glib Lie (Su): </b>At 11th level, a mesmerist can deceive truthdetecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the mesmerist&#146;s class level to succeed (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn&#146;t detect the mesmerist&#146;s lies or force him to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the mesmerist the glibness spell&#146;s bonus on Bluff checks.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>

					<p>A hate-monger masters a broad repertoire of emotional corruption. At 1st level, he adds one spell from the 1st-level spells below to his spells known. When he would gain a new mesmerist trick, he can learn additional spells instead, adding two of the following spells of a level he can currently cast to his spells known: 1st&#151;cause fear, compel hostilityUC, delusional prideUM, demand offeringOA, forbid actionUM, lesser confusion, murderous commandUM, scare, sow thoughtARG; 2nd&#151;aversionOA, paranoiaOA, rage, unadulterated loathingUM; 3rd&#151; confusion, crushing despair, curse of disgustUM, fear, instant enemyAPG, malicious spiteUM, smug narcissismUM, spiteAPG; 4th&#151;envious urgeUM, feast on fearARG, greater forbid actionUM, modify memory, utter contemptUM; 5th&#151;foe to friendAPG, foster hatredOA, song of discord, repress memoryOA, unwilling shieldAPG, vengeful outrageUM; 6th&#151; eyebite, insanity, overwhelming presenceUM, symbol of persuasion. When he casts a spell he learns in this way, he increases the duration as if his caster level were 1 higher. Starting at 5th level, the save DC is increased by 1 for creatures of his favored enemy type.</p>

				<name type="string">Hypnotic Stare</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it.

				<name type="string">Painful Stare</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Hate-mongers are xenophobic and judgmental rabblerousers who whip up mobs against enemies real or imagined.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Consummate Liar: </b>A mesmerist adds 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Bluff checks. In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesn&#146;t have Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of at least 13. He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater Feint.</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su): </b>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Mental Manipulator (Ex): </b>A hate-monger masters a broad repertoire of emotional corruption. At 1st level, he adds one spell from the 1st-level spells below to his spells known. When he would gain a new mesmerist trick, he can learn additional spells instead, adding two of the following spells of a level he can currently cast to his spells known: 1st&#151;cause fear, compel hostilityUC, delusional prideUM, demand offeringOA, forbid actionUM, lesser confusion, murderous commandUM, scare, sow thoughtARG; 2nd&#151;aversionOA, paranoiaOA, rage, unadulterated loathingUM; 3rd&#151; confusion, crushing despair, curse of disgustUM, fear, instant enemyAPG, malicious spiteUM, smug narcissismUM, spiteAPG; 4th&#151;envious urgeUM, feast on fearARG, greater forbid actionUM, modify memory, utter contemptUM; 5th&#151;foe to friendAPG, foster hatredOA, song of discord, repress memoryOA, unwilling shieldAPG, vengeful outrageUM; 6th&#151; eyebite, insanity, overwhelming presenceUM, symbol of persuasion. When he casts a spell he learns in this way, he increases the duration as if his caster level were 1 higher. Starting at 5th level, the save DC is increased by 1 for creatures of his favored enemy type.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces consummate liar and alters mesmerist tricks.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Painful Stare (Su): </b>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>
			<p><b>Towering Ego (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a mesmerist gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 0) on Will saving throws. If the mesmerist is under any effect that would prevent him from providing the emotional component of psychic spells (see page 144), he loses this bonus on saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Bold Stare (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can&#146;t be changed later. The mesmerist can&#146;t choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist&#146;s bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Insidious Hatred (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a hate-monger can sow hatred and strife under the pretense of assisting others. He can use his touch treatment only on others, but as part of the action of using touch treatment, he can cast any targeted spell from the mental manipulator list that does not have a range of &#147;personal&#148; and has a casting time of 1 standard action or less, targeting only the creature that receives his touch treatment. That creature doesn&#146;t realize the hatemonger has cast a spell, and considers any manifestations to be part of the touch treatment. Other creatures notice as normal. The target creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on its saving throw and to its spell resistance against the spell.</p>
			<p>This ability alters touch treatment.</p>
			<p><b>Touch Treatment (Su): </b>At 3rd level, the mesmerist can help allies shake off harmful conditions&#151;especially those that affect their minds&#151;by channeling psychic energy through his healing hands. He can use touch treatment a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the mesmerist uses it on himself ), and the mesmerist must be able to touch his target. He can remove one condition from one target each time he uses this ability. At 3rd level, he can remove any condition on the minor conditions list. At 6th level, he can remove any condition on the minor or moderate conditions list, and at 10th level, he can remove any condition on the minor, moderate, or greater conditions list.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Minor Conditions: </i>Fascinated, shaken.</li>
				<li><i>Moderate Conditions: </i>Confused, dazed, frightened, sickened.</li>
				<li><i>Greater Conditions: </i>Cowering, nauseated, panicked, stunned.</li>
			</list>
			<p>A 14th level, the mesmerist can instead expend one use of touch treatment to replicate the effects of break enchantment. This targets only one creature the mesmerist is touching and follows all other restrictions of touch treatment.</p>
			<p><b>Xenophobe (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a hate-monger can choose one favored enemy, as per the ranger class feature. His favored enemy bonus begins at +2 and increases by 2 for every 4 mesmerist levels after 5th, but he does not gain additional favored enemies. His favored enemy bonus also applies on Intimidate checks against his favored enemy.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces mental potency and manifold tricks.</p>
			<p><b>Out for Blood (Ex): </b>At 7th level, when a creature takes extra damage from the hate-monger&#146;s painful stare, it also takes 1 point of bleed damage (or 1 point of bleed damage per 1d6 points of damage dealt by the painful stare if the hatemonger damages the target himself ). This bleed damage does not stack with itself or other sources of bleed damage.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the 7th-level bold stare.</p>
			<p><b>Insidious Emotions (Su): </b>At 11th level, the power of a hatemonger&#146;s psychic hold becomes more difficult to detect or to break. The DC of Sense Motive checks to notice if a creature is under the effects of his enchantments with the emotionUM descriptor increases by 5 (if he also has the Subtle EnchantmentUI feat, the effects stack), as does the DC to identify his emotion spells. Magical divinations can detect his emotion effects only if the caster succeeds at a caster level check (DC = 11 + the hate-monger&#146;s mesmerist level) as if the affected creatures were the subject of nondetection.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces glib lie.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>Rule Minds (Su): </b>At 20th level, a mesmerist can permanently mentally enslave a creature. When the mesmerist successfully affects the target of his hypnotic stare with an enchantment spell that requires a saving throw, he can force that creature to attempt a second Will saving throw with a DC equal to the spell&#146;s DC. The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn&#146;t a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can&#146;t be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.</p>

					<p>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1).

This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 3rd level, as a standard action, a gaslighter can implant a maddening phantasm in the mind of the target of his hypnotic stare, causing the target to perceive its own reflection as corrupted in some disturbing way. This is a mind-affecting fear effect, and there is no saving throw. The target is simultaneously captivated and horrified by the sight of its own reflection, and in any round in which the target can see itself in a mirror within 30 feet, the gaslighter can trigger his painful stare against the target without dealing damage. This is a gaze attack, and the creature can avert its eyes to attempt to avoid it. Any creature holding a visible mirror that attempts to demoralize the target can choose to add the gaslighter&#146;s Charisma modifier to its Intimidate check instead of its own. Horrid mask lasts until that particular hypnotic stare ends (often when the target moves away from a mirror). The gaslighter can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>This ability replaces touch treatment (minor) and alters painful stare.</p>

					<p>At 6th level, a gaslighter can force the target of his horrid mask ability to recoil from its reflection. Whenever the gaslighter uses horrid mask, if an affected target begins its turn adjacent to a mirror, it must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the gaslighter&#146;s mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier) or be compelled to either flee from the mirror (or the creature holding it) to beyond 30 feet or attempt to destroy the mirror (or the creature holding it). This is a gaze attack, and the target can attempt to avert its eyes.</p>

The target is treated as flanked for any melee attacks against it until the hypnotic stare ends. The gaslighter can use either this ability or horrid mask during a particular hypnotic stare, but not both at once. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A gaslighter takes joy in others&#146; suffering, delighting in driving them to madness.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>A gaslighter must be of an evil alignment. A gaslighter who becomes nonevil cannot gain new levels as a mesmerist but retains all his class abilities.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Mesmerist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Consummate Cruelty: </b>A gaslighter gains a bonus equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) on Intimidate checks. A gaslighter can take Improved Dirty TrickAPG and Greater Dirty TrickAPG without having Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of 13. He can also ignore those two prerequisites for other feats that have Improved Dirty Trick or Greater Dirty Trick as a prerequisite.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces consummate liar.</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su): </b>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Painful Stare (Su): </b>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>
			<p><b>Towering Ego (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a mesmerist gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 0) on Will saving throws. If the mesmerist is under any effect that would prevent him from providing the emotional component of psychic spells (see page 144), he loses this bonus on saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Bold Stare (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can&#146;t be changed later. The mesmerist can&#146;t choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist&#146;s bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Horrid Mask (Su): </b>At 3rd level, as a standard action, a gaslighter can implant a maddening phantasm in the mind of the target of his hypnotic stare, causing the target to perceive its own reflection as corrupted in some disturbing way. This is a mind-affecting fear effect, and there is no saving throw. The target is simultaneously captivated and horrified by the sight of its own reflection, and in any round in which the target can see itself in a mirror within 30 feet, the gaslighter can trigger his painful stare against the target without dealing damage. This is a gaze attack, and the creature can avert its eyes to attempt to avoid it. Any creature holding a visible mirror that attempts to demoralize the target can choose to add the gaslighter&#146;s Charisma modifier to its Intimidate check instead of its own. Horrid mask lasts until that particular hypnotic stare ends (often when the target moves away from a mirror). The gaslighter can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces touch treatment (minor) and alters painful stare.</p>
			<p><b>Manifold Tricks (Su): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can have two tricks implanted at a time. The number of concurrent tricks increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he possesses beyond 5th. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist&#146;s tricks).</p>
			<p><b>Mental Potency (Ex): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment or illusion spell he casts increase by 1. For enchantment and illusion spells he casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be). For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>
			<p><b>Phantasmal Force (Su): </b>At 6th level, a gaslighter can force the target of his horrid mask ability to recoil from its reflection. Whenever the gaslighter uses horrid mask, if an affected target begins its turn adjacent to a mirror, it must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the gaslighter&#146;s mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier) or be compelled to either flee from the mirror (or the creature holding it) to beyond 30 feet or attempt to destroy the mirror (or the creature holding it). This is a gaze attack, and the target can attempt to avert its eyes.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces touch treatment (moderate).</p>
			<p><b>Phantasmal Foes (Su): </b>At 10th level, a gaslighter can spend one use of his horrid mask ability as a standard action to convince the target of his hypnotic stare that it is surrounded by foes only it can see. The target is treated as flanked for any melee attacks against it until the hypnotic stare ends. The gaslighter can use either this ability or horrid mask during a particular hypnotic stare, but not both at once. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces touch treatment (greater).</p>
			<p><b>Glib Lie (Su): </b>At 11th level, a mesmerist can deceive truthdetecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the mesmerist&#146;s class level to succeed (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn&#146;t detect the mesmerist&#146;s lies or force him to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the mesmerist the glibness spell&#146;s bonus on Bluff checks.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>Corosion of Sanity (Su): </b>At 14th level, whenever a creature fails its initial saving throw against a gaslighter&#146;s singletarget mind-affecting effect, the target also takes 1 point of Wisdom damage. This has no effect on abilities that don&#146;t allow a saving throw or affect multiple targets or an area. If using the sanity system (see page 12), the target takes 2 points of sanity damage instead.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces touch treatment (break enchantment).</p>
			<p><b>Rule Minds (Su): </b>At 20th level, a mesmerist can permanently mentally enslave a creature. When the mesmerist successfully affects the target of his hypnotic stare with an enchantment spell that requires a saving throw, he can force that creature to attempt a second Will saving throw with a DC equal to the spell&#146;s DC. The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn&#146;t a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can&#146;t be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist adds 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Bluff checks. In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesn&#146;t have Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of at least 13. He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater Feint.</p>

				<name type="string">Hypnotic Stare</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>

Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
					<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
					<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
					<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
					<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>

				<name type="string">Painful Stare</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>

				<name type="string">Fey Veil</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 3rd level, a fey trickster&#146;s physical form begins to shift, as she gains some of the impossible allure of the fey. At the same time, she begins able to use fey veils to assist herself and her allies in befuddling and bewitching their opponents. She can use her fey veils a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the fey trickster calls up a veil over herself ). If she targets another ally, the fey trickster must be able to contact the ally bodily, usually with a kiss. When she uses her fey veil, the fey trickster subtly alters the appearance and aura of her target, granting one of the powers allowed by her mesmerist level. t 3rd level, she can grant the ally a +2 circumstance bonus on her choice of Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Handle Animal checks for 1 minute. At 6th level, she can change the ally&#146;s form so thoroughly that the ally gains a +10 bonus on Disguise checks until the next sunrise (similar to the bonus from disguise self, but it also disguises touch and sound, and it doesn&#146;t allow a saving throw to disbelieve).</p>
					<p>At 10th level, the fey trickster can make the ally and her aura so attractive or repulsive for 10 minutes that the veil automatically adjusts the moods of those who see the ally and fail their saving throw, as telempathic projectionOA. At 14th level, a fey trickster can create a veil so powerful that it fools even reality, granting the full effects of both the 6th-level fey veil and alter self to the target for 1 hour. Each of these abilities, even the 14th-level ability, is an illusion and glamer effect, though the last ability counts as a size-changing polymorph effect for the limit of only one polymorph or size-changing effect on a creature.</p>
					<p>This ability replaces touch treatment.</p>

					<p>Rather than casting psychic spells from the mesmerist spell list, a fey trickster casts divine spells drawn from the druid and ranger spell lists, in just the same way as a hunter does. This means that she gains orisons instead of knacks. This doesn&#146;t change her number of spells per day or spells known. The fey trickster&#146;s mesmerist spells and spell-like abilities count as if they were fey spell-like abilities for the purpose of effects like resist nature&#146;s lure that apply against fey spell-like abilities.</p>

					<p>At 5th level, the mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment or illusion spell he casts increase by 1. For enchantment and illusion spells he casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be). For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Most mesmerists draw psychic power from the Astral Plane, but a few gain their powers in an unusual way: from a brush with the fey. Prisoner-guests of the fey, these souls find themselves changed when they return to the mortal world, infused with the eldritch energy of their former hosts.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Mesmerist's class skills are Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Consummate Liar: </b>A mesmerist adds 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Bluff checks. In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesn&#146;t have Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of at least 13. He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater Feint.</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su): </b>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Nature&#146;s Lure: </b>Rather than casting psychic spells from the mesmerist spell list, a fey trickster casts divine spells drawn from the druid and ranger spell lists, in just the same way as a hunter does. This means that she gains orisons instead of knacks. This doesn&#146;t change her number of spells per day or spells known. The fey trickster&#146;s mesmerist spells and spell-like abilities count as if they were fey spell-like abilities for the purpose of effects like resist nature&#146;s lure that apply against fey spell-like abilities.</p>
			<p>This alters the mesmerist&#146;s spellcasting.</p>
			<p><b>Painful Stare (Su): </b>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>
			<p><b>Feytouched (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a fey trickster&#146;s time with the fey has granted her strange powers, as well as resistance to further fey mischief. The fey trickster gains the druid&#146;s resist nature&#146;s lure and woodland stride abilities, and she counts as both fey and her original creature type for the purpose of spells and effects.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces towering ego.</p>
			<p><b>Bold Stare (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can&#146;t be changed later. The mesmerist can&#146;t choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist&#146;s bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Fey Veil (Sp, Su): </b>At 3rd level, a fey trickster&#146;s physical form begins to shift, as she gains some of the impossible allure of the fey. At the same time, she begins able to use fey veils to assist herself and her allies in befuddling and bewitching their opponents. She can use her fey veils a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the fey trickster calls up a veil over herself ). If she targets another ally, the fey trickster must be able to contact the ally bodily, usually with a kiss. When she uses her fey veil, the fey trickster subtly alters the appearance and aura of her target, granting one of the powers allowed by her mesmerist level. t 3rd level, she can grant the ally a +2 circumstance bonus on her choice of Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Handle Animal checks for 1 minute. At 6th level, she can change the ally&#146;s form so thoroughly that the ally gains a +10 bonus on Disguise checks until the next sunrise (similar to the bonus from disguise self, but it also disguises touch and sound, and it doesn&#146;t allow a saving throw to disbelieve).</p>
			<p>At 10th level, the fey trickster can make the ally and her aura so attractive or repulsive for 10 minutes that the veil automatically adjusts the moods of those who see the ally and fail their saving throw, as telempathic projectionOA. At 14th level, a fey trickster can create a veil so powerful that it fools even reality, granting the full effects of both the 6th-level fey veil and alter self to the target for 1 hour. Each of these abilities, even the 14th-level ability, is an illusion and glamer effect, though the last ability counts as a size-changing polymorph effect for the limit of only one polymorph or size-changing effect on a creature.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces touch treatment.</p>
			<p><b>Manifold Tricks (Su): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can have two tricks implanted at a time. The number of concurrent tricks increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he possesses beyond 5th. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist&#146;s tricks).</p>
			<p><b>Mental Potency (Ex): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment or illusion spell he casts increase by 1. For enchantment and illusion spells he casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be). For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>
			<p><b>Glib Lie (Su): </b>At 11th level, a mesmerist can deceive truthdetecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the mesmerist&#146;s class level to succeed (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn&#146;t detect the mesmerist&#146;s lies or force him to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the mesmerist the glibness spell&#146;s bonus on Bluff checks.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>One with the Fey: </b>At 20th level, a fey trickster fully transforms into a fey, though she can still choose to count as her original creature type as well whenever it would be advantageous to her (such as if she is a humanoid and wishes to be affected by reduce person). She gains low-light vision as well as an additional ability depending on which type of fey she chooses to most closely associate with. Some examples follow.</p>
			<p>Erlking: The fey trickster is constantly under the effects of haste.</p>
			<p>Nymph: The fey trickster gains the nymph&#146;s unearthly grace ability (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 217)</p>
			<p>Quickling: The fey trickster gains the quickling&#146;s supernatural speed ability (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 227).</p>
			<p>Rusalka: The fey trickster gains the rusalka&#146;s tresses ability and four tress primary natural attacks similar to those of a rusalka (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 232).</p>
			<p>This ability replaces rule minds.</p>

					<p>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Mesmerists focus their abilities through the eyes, drawing forth their power as the windows to the mind and soul. Eyebiters take this a step further. An eyebiter&#146;s eyes become so infused with psychic might that they can leave the eyebiter&#146;s body and move about on their own.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Mesmerist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Eyeball Familiar (Ex): </b>An eyebiter imbues one of his eyes with limited sentience, so that he can pluck it out and allow it to move on its own. The eyeball familiar functions similarly to the tumor familiar alchemist discovery (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 17) except as follows. The eyeball familiar does not have fast healing. The eyeball familiar doesn&#146;t resemble an animal, and its size is Fine for a Medium or smaller eyebiter (or one size category larger for every size category the eyebiter is larger than Medium). It has a fly speed of 20 feet (perfect maneuverability) and no physical attacks (though it can still deliver touch spells once the eyebiter has reached 3rd level). The eyeball has a Strength score of 1, a Dexterity score of 12, and a Constitution score of 10. It has no set Hit Die, base saves, or skill ranks of its own, though it uses its master&#146;s when a familiar normally would. It doesn&#146;t grant its master any familiar bonus, nor can it ever be an improved familiar.</p>
			<p>Whenever the eyebiter&#146;s eyeball familiar leaves his body, he is dazzled until it returns (if it is destroyed, the eyebiter loses that eye until he gains the effects of a regeneration). An eyebiter must have at least one eye to use this ability, and an eyebiter with only one eye is blinded instead of dazzled until his familiar returns.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces consummate liar and the mesmerist trick gained at 1st level.</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su): </b>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Painful Stare (Su): </b>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 2nd level, and learns another trick at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Towering Ego (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a mesmerist gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 0) on Will saving throws. If the mesmerist is under any effect that would prevent him from providing the emotional component of psychic spells (see page 144), he loses this bonus on saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Bold Stare (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can&#146;t be changed later. The mesmerist can&#146;t choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist&#146;s bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Ocular Occlusion (Su): </b>At 3rd level, an eyebiter gains the ability to cloud the sight of others with a melee touch attack. He can use this ability as a standard action a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. A successful Will save negates the effect (DC = 10 + 1/2 the eyebiter&#146;s mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier); this is a mind-affecting ability. If the eyebiter chooses to use an ocular occlusion of a lower level than the highest-level effect he has gained, he can instead use a standard action to target a creature within 30 feet with that effect as a ranged touch attack.</p>
			<p><i>Clouded Vision: </i>At 3rd level, the eyebiter can cause the target to become dazzled for 1 minute and suffer a 20% miss chance on all attacks the target makes against opponents within 60 feet. Opponents more than 60 feet away have total concealment from the target.</p>
			<p><i>Cause or Cure Blindness: </i>At 6th level, the eyebiter can blind the target for 1 minute or affect it as per the spells remove blindness.</p>
			<p><i>Eyeless Horror: </i>At 10th level, the eyebiter creates a powerful illusion that causes the target&#146;s eyes to appear as if they have been ripped out, with blood pouring from the sockets. The target is blinded and shaken for 1 round per the eyebiter&#146;s mesmerist level, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage each round. The target can attempt a second Will save when attacked to negate the shaken effect and the nonlethal damage.</p>
			<p><i>Spellblight: </i>At 14th level, the eyebiter can afflict the target with the ebon eyes, the eldritch cataracts, or the hemoculysis spellblight (Ultimate Magic 95).</p>
			<p>This ability replaces all instances of touch treatment.</p>
			<p><b>Manifold Tricks (Su): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can have two tricks implanted at a time. The number of concurrent tricks increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he possesses beyond 5th. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist&#146;s tricks).</p>
			<p><b>Staring Eye (Su): </b>At 5th level, an eyebiter can expend one use of his daily mesmerist tricks to either see through his eyeball familiar as if it were an arcane eye, or to use his hypnotic stare (including related abilities like painful stare and bold stare), as well as any gaze attack he possesses (like burning gaze and eyebite) through his eyeball familiar, as if he were at its location.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces mental potency.</p>
			<p><b>Omnivisual (Ex): </b>At 11th level, an eyebiter&#146;s roving eyeball familiar is constantly watching in all directions. As long as his eyeball familiar is outside his body and near enough to see the same things (such as being in the same room), the eyebiter gains all-around vision (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 294) and cannot be flanked.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces glib lie.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>Rule Minds (Su): </b>At 20th level, a mesmerist can permanently mentally enslave a creature. When the mesmerist successfully affects the target of his hypnotic stare with an enchantment spell that requires a saving throw, he can force that creature to attempt a second Will saving throw with a DC equal to the spell&#146;s DC. The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn&#146;t a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can&#146;t be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level, the mesmerist can help allies shake off harmful conditions&#151;especially those that affect their minds&#151;by channeling psychic energy through his healing hands. He can use touch treatment a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the mesmerist uses it on himself ), and the mesmerist must be able to touch his target. He can remove one condition from one target each time he uses this ability. At 3rd level, he can remove any condition on the minor conditions list. At 6th level, he can remove any condition on the minor or moderate conditions list, and at 10th level, he can remove any condition on the minor, moderate, or greater conditions list.</p>
					<p><i>Minor Conditions: </i>Fascinated, shaken.</p>
					<p><i>Moderate Conditions: </i>Confused, dazed, frightened, sickened.</p>
					<p><i>Greater Conditions: </i>Cowering, nauseated, panicked, stunned.</p>
					<p>A 14th level, the mesmerist can instead expend one use of touch treatment to replicate the effects of break enchantment. This targets only one creature the mesmerist is touching and follows all other restrictions of touch treatment.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level, the mesmerist can help allies shake off harmful conditions&#151;especially those that affect their minds&#151;by channeling psychic energy through his healing hands.

Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the mesmerist uses it on himself ), and the mesmerist must be able to touch his target.

					<p>At 1st level, whenever the enigma uses hypnotic stare on a creature, instead of applying a penalty on the creature&#146;s saving throws, the enigma begins to fade from the creature&#146;s view.

Starting on the enigma&#146;s next turn, he gains the effect of invisibility against that creature. These effects last as long as the enigma continues to use his hypnotic stare, but if he takes an action that would end invisibility, it ends his hypnotic stare immediately. The enigma can reinstate this effect whenever he wishes, but each time it begins with 1 round of concealment. At 8th level, attacks that would end invisibility do not end the enigma&#146;s hypnotic stare, and after 1 round of concealment, he gains the benef its of greater invisibility against the target of his stare. For the purpose of bold stare improvements, the enigma&#146;s hypnotic stare always has a penalty of &#150;1.</p>

					<p>At 5th level, the mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment or illusion spell he casts increase by 1.

For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>An enigma spends his life dedicated to developing psychic abilities that allow him to operate unnoticed. While the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare might not realize that the mesmerist is the source of the strange thoughts invading his mind, an enigma takes that mental obfuscation to a more extreme level. Enigmas often end up serving as master spies and infiltration experts.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Mesmerist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Enigmatic Stare (Su): </b>The target of an enigma&#146;s hypnotic stare takes a &#150;4 penalty on Perception checks to notice the enigma. At 8th level, this penalty increases to &#150; 6.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces painful stare.</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su): </b>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Solipsism (Su) </b>: At 1st level, whenever the enigma uses hypnotic stare on a creature, instead of applying a penalty on the creature&#146;s saving throws, the enigma begins to fade from the creature&#146;s view. Until the enigma&#146;s next turn, the enigma gains the effects of concealment against that creature (unless it can see invisible creatures). Starting on the enigma&#146;s next turn, he gains the effect of invisibility against that creature. These effects last as long as the enigma continues to use his hypnotic stare, but if he takes an action that would end invisibility, it ends his hypnotic stare immediately. The enigma can reinstate this effect whenever he wishes, but each time it begins with 1 round of concealment. At 8th level, attacks that would end invisibility do not end the enigma&#146;s hypnotic stare, and after 1 round of concealment, he gains the benef its of greater invisibility against the target of his stare. For the purpose of bold stare improvements, the enigma&#146;s hypnotic stare always has a penalty of &#150;1.</p>
			<p>This ability alters hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Veiled Steps: </b>An enigma gains a bonus to his Stealth checks equal to 1/4 his mesmerist level (minimum +1).</p>
			<p>This ability replaces consummate liar.</p>
			<p><b>Towering Ego (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a mesmerist gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 0) on Will saving throws. If the mesmerist is under any effect that would prevent him from providing the emotional component of psychic spells (see page 144), he loses this bonus on saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Bold Stare (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can&#146;t be changed later. The mesmerist can&#146;t choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist&#146;s bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Touch Treatment (Su): </b>At 3rd level, the mesmerist can help allies shake off harmful conditions&#151;especially those that affect their minds&#151;by channeling psychic energy through his healing hands. He can use touch treatment a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the mesmerist uses it on himself ), and the mesmerist must be able to touch his target. He can remove one condition from one target each time he uses this ability. At 3rd level, he can remove any condition on the minor conditions list. At 6th level, he can remove any condition on the minor or moderate conditions list, and at 10th level, he can remove any condition on the minor, moderate, or greater conditions list.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Minor Conditions: </i>Fascinated, shaken.</li>
				<li><i>Moderate Conditions: </i>Confused, dazed, frightened, sickened.</li>
				<li><i>Greater Conditions: </i>Cowering, nauseated, panicked, stunned.</li>
			</list>
			<p>A 14th level, the mesmerist can instead expend one use of touch treatment to replicate the effects of break enchantment. This targets only one creature the mesmerist is touching and follows all other restrictions of touch treatment.</p>
			<p><b>Transfer Affliction (Su): </b>At 3rd level, the enigma can afflict others with the harmful conditions that he endures. This ability functions as the touch treatment ability, but can only be used to remove harmful conditions from the enigma, not other creatures. In order to remove these harmful effects, the enigma must succeed at a touch attack against another creature. The creature touched gains the chosen harmful effect for whatever duration it would have afflicted the enigma and the effect is removed from the enigma, unless the creature succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the enigma&#146;s mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier). Using this ability is always a standard action. At 14th level, the enigma can instead expend one use of touch treatment to replicate the effects of bestow curse, delivered as a touch attack as part of using this ability. Transfer affliction is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p>This ability alters touch treatment.</p>
			<p><b>Mental Potency (Ex): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment or illusion spell he casts increase by 1. For enchantment and illusion spells he casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be). For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack (Ex): </b>At 5th level, an enigma gains the sneak attack ability of a rogue. This sneak attack damage is +1d6 at 5th level, and increases by +1d6 every 4 mesmerist levels thereafter.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces manifold tricks.</p>
			<p><b>Detection Void (Su): </b>At 11th level, an enigma can elude detection spells (spells with &#147;detect&#148; in their name). A creature using this sort of magic against the enigma must succeed at a caster level check against a DC equal to 15 + the enigma&#146;s class level to succeed (as if the enigma was under the effect of a nondetection spell); failure means the magic fails to detect the enigma, as if he did not exist.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces glib lie.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>Absentia (Su): </b>At 20th level, all creatures adjacent to the enigma subconsciously ignore him. Adjacent creatures are always treated as flat-footed to the enigma and are not considered to be directly observing the enigma for the purpose of the Stealth skill. This effect ends immediately if the enigma makes a successful attack against any creature, but automatically resumes at the beginning of his next turn.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces rule minds.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>

In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesn&#146;t have Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of at least 13. He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater Feint.</p>

				<name type="string">Hypnotic Stare</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
					<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
					<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 2nd level, and learns another trick at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>

He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
					<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
					<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 2nd level, and learns another trick at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Many mesmerists concentrate their studies on conscious, rational thought, but dreamstalkers instead delve into the unleashed unconscious mind that wanders free in dreams.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Mesmerist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Consummate Liar: </b>A mesmerist adds 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Bluff checks. In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesn&#146;t have Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of at least 13. He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater Feint.</p>
			<p><b>Dreams of Pain: </b>A dreamstalker&#146;s painful stare deals nonlethal damage. This ability alters painful stare.</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su): </b>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Painful Stare (Su): </b>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>
			<p><b>Somnomancer: </b>At 1st level, a dreamstalker gains the slumberAPG hex. The dreamstalker&#146;s effective witch level is equal to her mesmerist level, and she can activate them only by expending two daily uses of mesmerist tricks. The save DCs for her hexes are Charisma-based. She can take certain additional hexes in place of mesmerist tricks, selecting nightmaresAPG or visionAPG at 10th level and higher, or eternal slumberAPG at 18th level and higher.</p>
			<p>When she would normally gain a new mesmerist trick, she can learn additional spells instead. Each time she does so, she adds two of the following spells of a level she can currently cast to her list of spells known: 1st&#151;oneiric horrorOA, sleep; 2nd&#151;detect mindscapeOA, greater oneiric horrorOA, instigate psychic duelOA; 3rd&#151;deep slumber, minor dreamOA; 4th&#151;create mindscapeOA, dream, forgetful slumberARG, mindscape doorOA, sleepwalkARG, sleepwalking suggestion (see page 127); 5th&#151;cloak of dreams, dream councilOA, dream scanOA, symbol of sleep, waves of fatigue; 6th&#151;dream travelOA, greater create mindscapeOA, waves of exhaustion.</p>
			<p>This alters mesmerist tricks and replaces the 1st-level mesmerist trick.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 2nd level, and learns another trick at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Sleepless (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a dreamstalker gains immunity to sleep effects and a bonus equal to her Charisma bonus on saving throws against fatigue and exhaustion. She loses both benefits when under an effect that would prevent her from providing an emotion component (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 144).</p>
			<p>This replaces towering ego.</p>
			<p><b>Bold Stare (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can&#146;t be changed later. The mesmerist can&#146;t choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist&#146;s bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Touch of Night (Su): </b>A dreamstalker can&#146;t remove shaken, frightened, sickened, cowering, nauseated, or panicked conditions using her touch treatment. However, she can remove fatigue or magical sleep (other than hard-to-remove magical sleep such as the eternal slumberAPG hex) as a minor condition, staggered as a moderate condition, and exhausted as a greater condition. As normal, removing fatigue or exhaustion only removes the condition, not the underlying cause, such as lack of sleep.</p>
			<p>This ability alters touch treatment.</p>
			<p><b>Touch Treatment (Su): </b>At 3rd level, the mesmerist can help allies shake off harmful conditions&#151;especially those that affect their minds&#151;by channeling psychic energy through his healing hands. He can use touch treatment a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the mesmerist uses it on himself ), and the mesmerist must be able to touch his target. He can remove one condition from one target each time he uses this ability. At 3rd level, he can remove any condition on the minor conditions list. At 6th level, he can remove any condition on the minor or moderate conditions list, and at 10th level, he can remove any condition on the minor, moderate, or greater conditions list.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Minor Conditions: </i>Fascinated, shaken.</li>
				<li><i>Moderate Conditions: </i>Confused, dazed, frightened, sickened.</li>
				<li><i>Greater Conditions: </i>Cowering, nauseated, panicked, stunned.</li>
			</list>
			<p>A 14th level, the mesmerist can instead expend one use of touch treatment to replicate the effects of break enchantment. This targets only one creature the mesmerist is touching and follows all other restrictions of touch treatment.</p>
			<p><b>Dreamwalker (Su): </b>At 5th level, a dreamstalker treats dreamscapes as a favored terrain, as per the ranger ability, gaining a +2 bonus that increases by 2 every 4 mesmerist levels after 5th. While in a dreamscape, she also treats any creature from the Dimension of Dreams (including dreamed figments) as her favored enemy, with a bonus equal to 1/2 her favored terrain bonus.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces manifold tricks.</p>
			<p><b>Mental Potency (Ex): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment or illusion spell he casts increase by 1. For enchantment and illusion spells he casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be). For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>
			<p><b>Tramautic Spell: </b>At 11th level, a dreamstalker gains Traumatic SpellOA as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces glib lie.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>Rule Minds (Su): </b>At 20th level, a mesmerist can permanently mentally enslave a creature. When the mesmerist successfully affects the target of his hypnotic stare with an enchantment spell that requires a saving throw, he can force that creature to attempt a second Will saving throw with a DC equal to the spell&#146;s DC. The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn&#146;t a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can&#146;t be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.</p>

					<p>At 1st level, a cult master can turn his gaze on a creature to fill it with fervent belief in the cult master. The target of the gaze gains a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls.

Instead of taking the hypnotic stare&#146;s penalty on Will saves, the target gains a bonus of an equal amount on Will saves. The bonuses don&#146;t apply to attacks against the cult master or on saves against the cult master&#146;s spells or abilities.

					<p>Double: An illusion makes either the cult master&#146;s cohort or one of his followers appear to be him. The cult master can trigger this trick when he is targeted by an attack, provided he is adjacent to the subject, to give the attack a 50% miss chance. If the attack misses the cult master, it targets the subject instead. This is an illusion (glamer) effect.</p>
					<p>Extol: A mental compulsion causes a cohort or follower to extol the virtues of the cult master. The cult master can trigger this trick whenever he attempts a Diplomacy check, as long as he is within 60 feet of the subject. The subject takes the aid another action on the cult master&#146;s Diplomacy check. If the subject is successful, the cult master gains a +4 bonus on his check.

For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The leaders of some cults are simply charlatans, bathing in the adulation of their followers. Others believe themselves to be truly in touch with an unknown power, bringing their unique messages to those willing to follow and obey them.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Mesmerist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Cult Tricks (Su): </b>The following new tricks can be selected by a cult master. These tricks can be implanted only in a cohort or follower of the cult master.</p>
			<p><i>Double: </i>An illusion makes either the cult master&#146;s cohort or one of his followers appear to be him. The cult master can trigger this trick when he is targeted by an attack, provided he is adjacent to the subject, to give the attack a 50% miss chance. If the attack misses the cult master, it targets the subject instead. This is an illusion (glamer) effect.</p>
			<p><i>Extol: </i>A mental compulsion causes a cohort or follower to extol the virtues of the cult master. The cult master can trigger this trick whenever he attempts a Diplomacy check, as long as he is within 60 feet of the subject. The subject takes the aid another action on the cult master&#146;s Diplomacy check. If the subject is successful, the cult master gains a +4 bonus on his check. This is an enchantment (compulsion) effect.</p>
			<p>This ability alters mesmerist tricks.</p>
			<p><b>Fanatical Stare (Su): </b>At 1st level, a cult master can turn his gaze on a creature to fill it with fervent belief in the cult master. The target of the gaze gains a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls. This bonus increases by 1 for every 6 mesmerist levels the cult master possesses, to a maximum of +4 at 18th level. Instead of taking the hypnotic stare&#146;s penalty on Will saves, the target gains a bonus of an equal amount on Will saves. The bonuses don&#146;t apply to attacks against the cult master or on saves against the cult master&#146;s spells or abilities. The cult master can also suppress any penalties inflicted by his stare for the target. This ability replaces painful stare.</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su): </b>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Insidious Personality (Ex): </b>A cult master adds 1/2 his class level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Diplomacy checks. This ability replaces consummate liar.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Towering Ego (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a mesmerist gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 0) on Will saving throws. If the mesmerist is under any effect that would prevent him from providing the emotional component of psychic spells (see page 144), he loses this bonus on saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Bold Stare (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can&#146;t be changed later. The mesmerist can&#146;t choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist&#146;s bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>False Healing (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a cult master can provide temporary healing by using his psychic powers to trick the mind a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the cult master uses it on himself ), and the cult master must be able to touch his target. The cult master grants a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + his Charisma modifier to the target. At 6th level, the cult master can either grant a number of temporary hit points equal to 2d8 + his Charisma modifier to the target or temporarily remove 1d4 points of ability damage. A creature can receive the effect of the false healing only once per day. The temporary hit points or reduction in ability damage lasts a number of hours equal to the cult master&#146;s class level. This ability replaces the 3rd- and 6th-level touch treatments.</p>
			<p><b>Manifold Tricks (Su): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can have two tricks implanted at a time. The number of concurrent tricks increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he possesses beyond 5th. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist&#146;s tricks).</p>
			<p><b>Mental Potency (Ex): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment or illusion spell he casts increase by 1. For enchantment and illusion spells he casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be). For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>
			<p><b>Faithful Followers (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a cult master begins to attract followers to his espoused beliefs, thanks to his magnetic personality. The cult master gains Leadership as a bonus feat. This ability replaces the 7th-level bold stare.</p>
			<p><b>Fanatical Devotion (Ex): </b>At 10th level, a cult master has manipulated his cohort and followers into becoming utterly devoted to him. The cult master no longer takes a penalty to his Leadership score for being aloof or cruel. Additionally, the DCs of all enchantment spells the cult master casts on his cohort and followers increase by 4. At 14th level, the cult master no longer takes a penalty to his Leadership score for any cohorts or followers he has killed or caused to be killed. This ability replaces the 10th- and 14th-level touch treatments.</p>
			<p><b>Glib Lie (Su): </b>At 11th level, a mesmerist can deceive truthdetecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the mesmerist&#146;s class level to succeed (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn&#146;t detect the mesmerist&#146;s lies or force him to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the mesmerist the glibness spell&#146;s bonus on Bluff checks.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Cult Tricks (Su): </b>The following new master tricks can be selected by any cult master of 12th level or higher. These tricks can be implanted only in a cohort or follower of the cult master.</p>
			<p><i>Avenge Me: </i>The cult master creates a compulsion for one of his followers to avenge him. Whenever the cult master takes hit point damage from an attack, he can trigger this trick as long as he is within 60 feet of the subject. The subject is immediately affected as if by the rage spell for 1 round per mesmerist level.</p>
			<p><i>Die for Me: </i>The cult master instills within either his cohort or one of his followers the desire to give her life for him. The cult master can trigger this trick whenever he would take hit point damage from an attack, spell, or effect and the subject is with 60 feet of him. Half the damage is psychically transferred to the subject. This is an enchantment (compulsion) effect.</p>
			<p>This ability alters masterful tricks.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>Reborn (Su): </b>At 20th level, a cult master can ensure his own survival upon his death. The cult master can perform a 1-hour ceremony costing 5,000 gp in rare materials in which he uses his psychic powers to implant a small portion of his essence into his cohort, who must be a minimum of 17th level. When the cult master dies, in 7 days the cohort physically and mentally transforms into the cult master as if clone had been cast, except that the cohort&#146;s body takes the place of the inert body. The cult master can&#146;t use this ability again until he gains a new cohort of at least 17th level and performs the necessary ceremony. The cohort can&#146;t be brought back to life except through miracle or wish. This ability replaces rule minds.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist adds 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Bluff checks. In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesn&#146;t have Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of at least 13. He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater Feint.</p>

				<name type="string">Hypnotic Stare</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>

					<p>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
					<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
					<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>

				<name type="string">Painful Stare</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>

					<p>At 2nd level, a mesmerist gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 0) on Will saving throws. If the mesmerist is under any effect that would prevent him from providing the emotional component of psychic spells (see page 144), he loses this bonus on saving throws.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level, as an immediate action, a chart caster can grant an ally a +1 competence bonus on a failed attack roll, saving throw, or skill check by reminding his ally of their destined success. The chart caster must use his ability within 1 round of the failed check, and his ally must be within 30 feet of him when he does. If the bonus is enough to turn the failure into a success, the ally succeeds at the check. At 6th level, the bonus increases to +2. At 10th level, it increases to +5. A chart caster can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his Charisma modifier.</p>

					<p>A chart caster cannot implant tricks as a standard action. Instead, he can spend 5 minutes to implant multiple tricks in a single willing target. The number of tricks he can implant per day is unchanged from the regular mesmerist class, but he can apply as many of those tricks as he chooses on a single use of this ability.</p>
					<p>If implanting tricks in himself, the caster merely spends 5 minutes in contemplation; otherwise, he consults star charts while ritually asking the creature questions, and still must touch them to do so. At 1st level, he can select multiple instances of the same trick to implant in a single subject. At 5th level, a chart caster can implant two different subjects with multiple instances of one trick each and can choose a different trick for each subject. The number of additional subjects increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he has beyond 5th.</p>
					<p>Using this ability again on an existing subject or to implant any trick on a new subject ends all previously implanted tricks. The caster can trigger only one instance of the same trick on a given subject per round.</p>
					<p>This alters mesmerist tricks and manifold tricks.</p>

For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>

The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn&#146;t a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can&#146;t be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Lirgeni astrologists would divine their futures by consulting star charts, but some had no talent for astrology and simply faked their results. When prophecy died with Aroden, a few Lirgeni survivors continued with this &#147;reliable&#148; method.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Mesmerist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Consummate Liar: </b>A mesmerist adds 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Bluff checks. In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesn&#146;t have Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of at least 13. He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater Feint.</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su): </b>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Painful Stare (Su): </b>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>
			<p><b>Subject of the Stars (Su): </b>A chart caster cannot implant tricks as a standard action. Instead, he can spend 5 minutes to implant multiple tricks in a single willing target. The number of tricks he can implant per day is unchanged from the regular mesmerist class, but he can apply as many of those tricks as he chooses on a single use of this ability.</p>
			<p>If implanting tricks in himself, the caster merely spends 5 minutes in contemplation; otherwise, he consults star charts while ritually asking the creature questions, and still must touch them to do so. At 1st level, he can select multiple instances of the same trick to implant in a single subject. At 5th level, a chart caster can implant two different subjects with multiple instances of one trick each and can choose a different trick for each subject. The number of additional subjects increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he has beyond 5th.</p>
			<p>Using this ability again on an existing subject or to implant any trick on a new subject ends all previously implanted tricks. The caster can trigger only one instance of the same trick on a given subject per round.</p>
			<p>This alters mesmerist tricks and manifold tricks.</p>
			<p><b>Towering Ego (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a mesmerist gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 0) on Will saving throws. If the mesmerist is under any effect that would prevent him from providing the emotional component of psychic spells (see page 144), he loses this bonus on saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Bold Stare (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can&#146;t be changed later. The mesmerist can&#146;t choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist&#146;s bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Feign Destiny (Su): </b>At 3rd level, as an immediate action, a chart caster can grant an ally a +1 competence bonus on a failed attack roll, saving throw, or skill check by reminding his ally of their destined success. The chart caster must use his ability within 1 round of the failed check, and his ally must be within 30 feet of him when he does. If the bonus is enough to turn the failure into a success, the ally succeeds at the check. At 6th level, the bonus increases to +2. At 10th level, it increases to +5. A chart caster can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>This replaces touch treatment.</p>
			<p><b>Manifold Tricks (Su): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can have two tricks implanted at a time. The number of concurrent tricks increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he possesses beyond 5th. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist&#146;s tricks).</p>
			<p><b>Mental Potency (Ex): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment or illusion spell he casts increase by 1. For enchantment and illusion spells he casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be). For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>
			<p><b>Glib Lie (Su): </b>At 11th level, a mesmerist can deceive truthdetecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the mesmerist&#146;s class level to succeed (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn&#146;t detect the mesmerist&#146;s lies or force him to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the mesmerist the glibness spell&#146;s bonus on Bluff checks.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>Rule Minds (Su): </b>At 20th level, a mesmerist can permanently mentally enslave a creature. When the mesmerist successfully affects the target of his hypnotic stare with an enchantment spell that requires a saving throw, he can force that creature to attempt a second Will saving throw with a DC equal to the spell&#146;s DC. The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn&#146;t a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can&#146;t be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>

				<name type="string">Hypnotic Stare</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>

					<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>

					<p>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1).

This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, an autohypnotist has mastered techniques that make his hypnotic stare ability more potent, but at a terrible cost&#151;the autohypnotist succumbs to his own power when he uses it. Whenever the autohypnotist focuses his stare on an opponent, the penalties that opponent takes from the hypnotic stare (as well as any bold stare improvements or stare feats that the autohypnotist has) increase by 1. However, the autohypnotist takes the same penalties as his target while focusing his stare, including those of any bold stare improvements he has.</p>
					<p>An autohypnotist can reduce or negate the penalty he imposes upon himself with his hypnotic stare, but doing so allows his opponent an opportunity to escape from the stare as well. The autohypnotist can reduce the penalty he takes from his hypnotic stare ability by half for 1 round as a swift action. If he does so, there is a 25% chance that his hypnotic stare ends altogether. Alternatively, he can choose to negate the penalty he takes from his hypnotic stare for 1 round, but his hypnotic stare then has a 50% chance of ending.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>An autohypnotist has incredibly powerful psychic abilities that he can&#146;t entirely control. As a result, maintaining his powers against an opponent hinders him as much as his target.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Autohypnosis (Su): </b>At 1st level, an autohypnotist has mastered techniques that make his hypnotic stare ability more potent, but at a terrible cost&#151;the autohypnotist succumbs to his own power when he uses it. Whenever the autohypnotist focuses his stare on an opponent, the penalties that opponent takes from the hypnotic stare (as well as any bold stare improvements or stare feats that the autohypnotist has) increase by 1. However, the autohypnotist takes the same penalties as his target while focusing his stare, including those of any bold stare improvements he has.</p>
			<p>An autohypnotist can reduce or negate the penalty he imposes upon himself with his hypnotic stare, but doing so allows his opponent an opportunity to escape from the stare as well. The autohypnotist can reduce the penalty he takes from his hypnotic stare ability by half for 1 round as a swift action. If he does so, there is a 25% chance that his hypnotic stare ends altogether. Alternatively, he can choose to negate the penalty he takes from his hypnotic stare for 1 round, but his hypnotic stare then has a 50% chance of ending.</p>
			<p>This ability alters hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Consummate Liar: </b>A mesmerist adds 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Bluff checks. In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesn&#146;t have Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of at least 13. He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater Feint.</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su): </b>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Painful Stare (Su): </b>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>
			<p><b>Towering Ego (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a mesmerist gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 0) on Will saving throws. If the mesmerist is under any effect that would prevent him from providing the emotional component of psychic spells (see page 144), he loses this bonus on saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Bold Stare (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can&#146;t be changed later. The mesmerist can&#146;t choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist&#146;s bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Touch Treatment (Su): </b>At 3rd level, the mesmerist can help allies shake off harmful conditions&#151;especially those that affect their minds&#151;by channeling psychic energy through his healing hands. He can use touch treatment a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the mesmerist uses it on himself ), and the mesmerist must be able to touch his target. He can remove one condition from one target each time he uses this ability. At 3rd level, he can remove any condition on the minor conditions list. At 6th level, he can remove any condition on the minor or moderate conditions list, and at 10th level, he can remove any condition on the minor, moderate, or greater conditions list.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Minor Conditions: </i>Fascinated, shaken.</li>
				<li><i>Moderate Conditions: </i>Confused, dazed, frightened, sickened.</li>
				<li><i>Greater Conditions: </i>Cowering, nauseated, panicked, stunned.</li>
			</list>
			<p>A 14th level, the mesmerist can instead expend one use of touch treatment to replicate the effects of break enchantment. This targets only one creature the mesmerist is touching and follows all other restrictions of touch treatment.</p>
			<p><b>Manifold Tricks (Su): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can have two tricks implanted at a time. The number of concurrent tricks increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he possesses beyond 5th. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist&#146;s tricks).</p>
			<p><b>Wide Stare (Su): </b>At 5th level, whenever an autohypnotist is focusing his stare on a foe, he can broaden his hypnotic stare as a standard action. When he does so, all creatures within 10 feet of his opponent take penalties from the mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare and bold stare class features as if he were maintaining his hypnotic stare against each of those creatures, except such creatures treat his hypnotic stare penalty as if it were 2 lower. When the autohypnotist uses this ability, he cannot exclude allies or any other creatures from this effect. If the autohypnotist&#146;s hypnotic stare ends for the focused opponent, this effect ends.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces mental potency.</p>
			<p><b>Glib Lie (Su): </b>At 11th level, a mesmerist can deceive truthdetecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the mesmerist&#146;s class level to succeed (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn&#146;t detect the mesmerist&#146;s lies or force him to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the mesmerist the glibness spell&#146;s bonus on Bluff checks.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>Rule Minds (Su): </b>At 20th level, a mesmerist can permanently mentally enslave a creature. When the mesmerist successfully affects the target of his hypnotic stare with an enchantment spell that requires a saving throw, he can force that creature to attempt a second Will saving throw with a DC equal to the spell&#146;s DC. The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn&#146;t a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can&#146;t be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
					<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks.

					<p>At 3rd level, the aromaphile can touch a creature affected by his hypnotic aroma to alter its mental state. This functions as the touch treatment class feature, except the aromaphile cannot remove the confused, cowering, or stunned conditions, and he cannot break enchantments using this ability. Instead, he adds fatigued to his list of minor conditions and exhausted to his list of greater conditions.</p>
					<p>An aromaphile can also use this ability to inflict hampering conditions on a target by touching it. At 3rd level, he can cause his target to become fascinated by his aroma. At 6th level, he can deaden the target&#146;s emotions (as per calm emotions). At 10th level, he can cause the target to become stunned. At 14th level, he can cause the target to fall asleep (as per deep slumber, except the Hit Die limit is equal to the aromaphile&#146;s level + 2). The target can attempt a Will save to negate these effects (DC = 10 + half the aromaphile&#146;s level + the aromaphile&#146;s Charisma modifier). On a failed save, the target gains the chosen condition for a number of rounds equal to the aromaphile&#146;s level. Each round that the target is affected, it can attempt a new Will save at the same DC to end the effect early. If the target succeeds at such a save, its turn immediately ends.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level, the mesmerist can help allies shake off harmful conditions&#151;especially those that affect their minds&#151;by channeling psychic energy through his healing hands.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Rather than employ the baleful glares of the typical mesmerist, aromaphiles hypnotize others using an array of sickeningly sweet scents developed from their unique ghoran physiology.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Race: </b>Ghoran Only</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Mesmerist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Consummate Liar: </b>A mesmerist adds 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Bluff checks. In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesn&#146;t have Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of at least 13. He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater Feint.</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Aroma (Su): </b>As a swift action, an aromaphile can use unique aspects of ghoran biology to release intoxicating aromas in a 10-foot-radius burst centered on him. All creatures within this area, as well as creatures with scent within 30 feet, take a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty becomes &#150;3 at 8th level. The aroma hovers around the aromaphile, moving with him, and lasts for 1 minute. The hypnotic aroma must be inhaled to be effective, and creatures that choose to hold their breath, do not breathe, or are immune to inhaled poisons are immune to its effect.</p>
			<p>This replaces hypnotic stare, painful stare, and towering ego.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Aromatic Manipulation (Su): </b>At 3rd level, the aromaphile can touch a creature affected by his hypnotic aroma to alter its mental state. This functions as the touch treatment class feature, except the aromaphile cannot remove the confused, cowering, or stunned conditions, and he cannot break enchantments using this ability. Instead, he adds fatigued to his list of minor conditions and exhausted to his list of greater conditions.</p>
			<p>An aromaphile can also use this ability to inflict hampering conditions on a target by touching it. At 3rd level, he can cause his target to become fascinated by his aroma. At 6th level, he can deaden the target&#146;s emotions (as per calm emotions). At 10th level, he can cause the target to become stunned. At 14th level, he can cause the target to fall asleep (as per deep slumber, except the Hit Die limit is equal to the aromaphile&#146;s level + 2). The target can attempt a Will save to negate these effects (DC = 10 + half the aromaphile&#146;s level + the aromaphile&#146;s Charisma modifier). On a failed save, the target gains the chosen condition for a number of rounds equal to the aromaphile&#146;s level. Each round that the target is affected, it can attempt a new Will save at the same DC to end the effect early. If the target succeeds at such a save, its turn immediately ends.</p>
			<p>This alters touch treatment and replaces mental potency.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Aroma (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, an aromaphile can imbue his hypnotic aroma with other effects. These effects are the same as those listed within the bold stare mesmerist class feature, but they affect creatures affected by his hypnotic aroma for as long as they are affected by that ability. The aromaphile chooses one option each time he gains a new debilitating aroma improvement, and the choice can&#146;t be changed later. The aromaphile can&#146;t choose the same debilitating aroma more than once unless otherwise noted.</p>
			<p>This replaces bold stare.</p>
			<p><b>Touch Treatment (Su): </b>At 3rd level, the mesmerist can help allies shake off harmful conditions&#151;especially those that affect their minds&#151;by channeling psychic energy through his healing hands. He can use touch treatment a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the mesmerist uses it on himself ), and the mesmerist must be able to touch his target. He can remove one condition from one target each time he uses this ability. At 3rd level, he can remove any condition on the minor conditions list. At 6th level, he can remove any condition on the minor or moderate conditions list, and at 10th level, he can remove any condition on the minor, moderate, or greater conditions list.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Minor Conditions: </i>Fascinated, shaken.</li>
				<li><i>Moderate Conditions: </i>Confused, dazed, frightened, sickened.</li>
				<li><i>Greater Conditions: </i>Cowering, nauseated, panicked, stunned.</li>
			</list>
			<p>A 14th level, the mesmerist can instead expend one use of touch treatment to replicate the effects of break enchantment. This targets only one creature the mesmerist is touching and follows all other restrictions of touch treatment.</p>
			<p><b>Manifold Tricks (Su): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can have two tricks implanted at a time. The number of concurrent tricks increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he possesses beyond 5th. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist&#146;s tricks).</p>
			<p><b>Glib Lie (Su): </b>At 11th level, a mesmerist can deceive truthdetecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the mesmerist&#146;s class level to succeed (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn&#146;t detect the mesmerist&#146;s lies or force him to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the mesmerist the glibness spell&#146;s bonus on Bluff checks.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>Rule Minds (Su): </b>At 20th level, a mesmerist can permanently mentally enslave a creature. When the mesmerist successfully affects the target of his hypnotic stare with an enchantment spell that requires a saving throw, he can force that creature to attempt a second Will saving throw with a DC equal to the spell&#146;s DC. The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn&#146;t a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can&#146;t be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist adds 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Bluff checks. In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesn&#146;t have Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of at least 13. He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater Feint.</p>

				<name type="string">Hypnotic Stare</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>

				<name type="string">Mesmerist Trick</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
					<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
					<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>

					<p>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>

					<p>At 2nd level, a mesmerist gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 0) on Will saving throws. If the mesmerist is under any effect that would prevent him from providing the emotional component of psychic spells (see page 144), he loses this bonus on saving throws.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>-</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Mesmerist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Consummate Liar: </b>A mesmerist adds 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Bluff checks. In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesn&#146;t have Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of at least 13. He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater Feint.</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su): </b>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Painful Stare (Su): </b>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>
			<p><b>Towering Ego (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a mesmerist gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 0) on Will saving throws. If the mesmerist is under any effect that would prevent him from providing the emotional component of psychic spells (see page 144), he loses this bonus on saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Bold Stare (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can&#146;t be changed later. The mesmerist can&#146;t choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist&#146;s bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Touch Treatment (Su): </b>At 3rd level, the mesmerist can help allies shake off harmful conditions&#151;especially those that affect their minds&#151;by channeling psychic energy through his healing hands. He can use touch treatment a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the mesmerist uses it on himself ), and the mesmerist must be able to touch his target. He can remove one condition from one target each time he uses this ability. At 3rd level, he can remove any condition on the minor conditions list. At 6th level, he can remove any condition on the minor or moderate conditions list, and at 10th level, he can remove any condition on the minor, moderate, or greater conditions list.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Minor Conditions: </i>Fascinated, shaken.</li>
				<li><i>Moderate Conditions: </i>Confused, dazed, frightened, sickened.</li>
				<li><i>Greater Conditions: </i>Cowering, nauseated, panicked, stunned.</li>
			</list>
			<p>A 14th level, the mesmerist can instead expend one use of touch treatment to replicate the effects of break enchantment. This targets only one creature the mesmerist is touching and follows all other restrictions of touch treatment.</p>
			<p><b>Manifold Tricks (Su): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can have two tricks implanted at a time. The number of concurrent tricks increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he possesses beyond 5th. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist&#146;s tricks).</p>
			<p><b>Mental Potency (Ex): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment or illusion spell he casts increase by 1. For enchantment and illusion spells he casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be). For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>
			<p><b>Glib Lie (Su): </b>At 11th level, a mesmerist can deceive truthdetecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the mesmerist&#146;s class level to succeed (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn&#146;t detect the mesmerist&#146;s lies or force him to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the mesmerist the glibness spell&#146;s bonus on Bluff checks.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>Rule Minds (Su): </b>At 20th level, a mesmerist can permanently mentally enslave a creature. When the mesmerist successfully affects the target of his hypnotic stare with an enchantment spell that requires a saving throw, he can force that creature to attempt a second Will saving throw with a DC equal to the spell&#146;s DC. The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn&#146;t a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can&#146;t be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.</p>

Unlike most psychic spells, a vox&#146;s mesmerist spells use both thought and verbal components; like a bard, a vox cannot remove the verbal components of his spells.</p>
					<p>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>

					<p>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>

The target does not need to be able to understand what the vox is saying, but does need to be able to hear the sound of the vox&#146;s voice (for instance, this ability cannot be used if either the vox or his target is in an area of magical silence). Otherwise, the vox&#146;s compelling voice has the effects of the standard mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, and it gains further benefits as normal from abilities like the painful stare and bold stare class features.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Most mesmerists practice their mental manipulation through their entrancing gaze, but others have learned to practice their skill through the lilt and intonation of their voice. From sibilant whispers to overwhelming imprecations that resonate with the force of pure will, a vox unleashes the power of his mind with every silken syllable and shattering shout.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p>A vox adds the following spells to his class list: 1st&#151;ear-piercing screamUM; 2nd&#151; cacophonous callAPG, disrupt silenceUI, distracting cacophonyUM, piercing shriekUM, sonic screamACG; 4th&#151;shout, sonic thrustUM, wall of soundUM; 5th&#151;cacophonous call (mass) APG, echolocationUM, resonating wordUM; 6th&#151; magnifying chimeACG, shout (greater), sonic formACG. Unlike most psychic spells, a vox&#146;s mesmerist spells use both thought and verbal components; like a bard, a vox cannot remove the verbal components of his spells.</p>
			<p><b>Compelling Voice (Su): </b>A vox can focus the sound of his voice on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action, sapping that target&#146;s willpower and rendering her more vulnerable to mind-affecting powers, rather than using a stare like other mesmerists. A vox can use his compelling voice even while deafened, but it has a 20% chance to fail, just like casting a spell with a verbal component. The target does not need to be able to understand what the vox is saying, but does need to be able to hear the sound of the vox&#146;s voice (for instance, this ability cannot be used if either the vox or his target is in an area of magical silence). Otherwise, the vox&#146;s compelling voice has the effects of the standard mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, and it gains further benefits as normal from abilities like the painful stare and bold stare class features.</p>
			<p><b>Consummate Liar: </b>A mesmerist adds 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Bluff checks. In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesn&#146;t have Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of at least 13. He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater Feint.</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su): </b>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Painful Stare (Su): </b>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>
			<p><b>Towering Ego (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a mesmerist gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 0) on Will saving throws. If the mesmerist is under any effect that would prevent him from providing the emotional component of psychic spells (see page 144), he loses this bonus on saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Bold Stare (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can&#146;t be changed later. The mesmerist can&#146;t choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist&#146;s bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Wounding Words (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a vox can focus the power of his voice to magnify the force of his blows in melee. As a standard action, a vox can make a melee touch attack that deals 1d6 points of sonic damage plus 1 point per mesmerist level. Alternatively, he can make a single attack with a melee weapon as a standard action, adding the listed sonic damage to the damage dealt by his weapon on a successful attack. He can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. If the target of the vox&#146;s wounding words is also the target of his compelling voice, that creature must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vox&#146;s mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier) or take a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for 1 round. This penalty doesn&#146;t stack with the effects of the Concussive SpellUM metamagic feat.</p>
			<p><b>Manifold Tricks (Su): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can have two tricks implanted at a time. The number of concurrent tricks increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he possesses beyond 5th. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist&#146;s tricks).</p>
			<p><b>Mental Potency (Ex): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment or illusion spell he casts increase by 1. For enchantment and illusion spells he casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be). For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>
			<p><b>Subsonic Strike (Su): </b>At 10th level, a vox is able to unleash a deadly flurry of his wounding words as a standard action. He can target a number of creatures or objects equal to his Charisma modifier (minimum 1) within 30 feet, requiring a ranged touch attack against each target. If the target of his compelling voice is within 30 feet, he can choose to instead target only that creature with a single ranged touch or melee touch attack, dealing double normal damage on a successful attack. Whatever choice he makes, the vox must expend one use of wounding words.</p>
			<p><b>Glib Lie (Su): </b>At 11th level, a mesmerist can deceive truthdetecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the mesmerist&#146;s class level to succeed (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn&#146;t detect the mesmerist&#146;s lies or force him to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the mesmerist the glibness spell&#146;s bonus on Bluff checks.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>Rule Minds (Su): </b>At 20th level, a mesmerist can permanently mentally enslave a creature. When the mesmerist successfully affects the target of his hypnotic stare with an enchantment spell that requires a saving throw, he can force that creature to attempt a second Will saving throw with a DC equal to the spell&#146;s DC. The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn&#146;t a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can&#146;t be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>

					<p>At 2nd level, the vizier can use his mesmerist powers to make it seem like he is just a hanger-on who isn&#146;t contributing to a combat or social situation. This includes making it seem like one of his allies is casting his spells instead. When the vizier casts a spell, once the vizier&#146;s spell is complete, a glamer subtly alters onlookers&#146; memories and perception of the spell&#146;s casting such that all the usual manifestations of the spell indicate that the caster was one of the vizier&#146;s allies with an implanted trick. Creatures who observed the spellcasting can attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vizier&#146;s mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier) to disbelieve the glamer. Since this effect only comes into play after the spell&#146;s casting is complete, any attempts to ready an action against the spellcasting, counterspell, or take attacks of opportunity still work as normal. This ability does not prevent or otherwise hinder creatures from correctly targeting such attacks and abilities against the vizier (for instance, a creature readying an action to shoot an arrow to interrupt the spellcasting would still shoot the vizier). Additionally, when the vizier triggers an ally&#146;s implanted trick, flashy effects make it appear as if the ally was using an activated ability of her own.</p>
					<p>At 5th level, the vizier doesn&#146;t provoke attacks of opportunity when using power behind the throne, as if under the effects of a constant illusion of calmUC. A creature that disbelieves this second effect becomes immune to that vizier&#146;s illusion of calm for 24 hours.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level, the mesmerist can help allies shake off harmful conditions&#151;especially those that affect their minds&#151;by channeling psychic energy through his healing hands. He can use touch treatment a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>While many mesmerists focus on beguiling their foes or taking overt control of others with their mental powers, viziers carve out a subtler niche for themselves as advisors. An adventuring vizier is delighted that enemies focus on the raging barbarian or spell-slinging wizard first, not realizing the threat posed by the vizier until it&#146;s too late.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Mesmerist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su): </b>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Insidious Influence (Su): </b>A vizier subtly influences his allies and others who trust him, making it more likely they will follow his suggestions. Allies with mesmerist tricks implanted by the vizier take penalties on Will saves made to resist the vizier&#146;s abilities and spells, and on Diplomacy, Intimidate, Sense Motive checks attempted against the vizier. This penalty equals that imposed by the vizier&#146;s hypnotic stare. If the vizier uses his hypnotic stare against such an ally, these penalties stack.</p>
			<p>At 3rd level, the vizier automatically gains the susceptibility bold stare improvement, and it also applies to the DCs of any influence check to manipulate the target (even if it isn&#146;t Diplomacy or Intimidate).</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Painful Stare (Su): </b>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>
			<p><b>Power Behind the Throne (Su): </b>At 2nd level, the vizier can use his mesmerist powers to make it seem like he is just a hanger-on who isn&#146;t contributing to a combat or social situation. This includes making it seem like one of his allies is casting his spells instead. When the vizier casts a spell, once the vizier&#146;s spell is complete, a glamer subtly alters onlookers&#146; memories and perception of the spell&#146;s casting such that all the usual manifestations of the spell indicate that the caster was one of the vizier&#146;s allies with an implanted trick. Creatures who observed the spellcasting can attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vizier&#146;s mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier) to disbelieve the glamer. Since this effect only comes into play after the spell&#146;s casting is complete, any attempts to ready an action against the spellcasting, counterspell, or take attacks of opportunity still work as normal. This ability does not prevent or otherwise hinder creatures from correctly targeting such attacks and abilities against the vizier (for instance, a creature readying an action to shoot an arrow to interrupt the spellcasting would still shoot the vizier). Additionally, when the vizier triggers an ally&#146;s implanted trick, flashy effects make it appear as if the ally was using an activated ability of her own.</p>
			<p>At 5th level, the vizier doesn&#146;t provoke attacks of opportunity when using power behind the throne, as if under the effects of a constant illusion of calmUC. A creature that disbelieves this second effect becomes immune to that vizier&#146;s illusion of calm for 24 hours.</p>
			<p><b>Bold Stare (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can&#146;t be changed later. The mesmerist can&#146;t choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist&#146;s bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Touch Treatment (Su): </b>At 3rd level, the mesmerist can help allies shake off harmful conditions&#151;especially those that affect their minds&#151;by channeling psychic energy through his healing hands. He can use touch treatment a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the mesmerist uses it on himself ), and the mesmerist must be able to touch his target. He can remove one condition from one target each time he uses this ability. At 3rd level, he can remove any condition on the minor conditions list. At 6th level, he can remove any condition on the minor or moderate conditions list, and at 10th level, he can remove any condition on the minor, moderate, or greater conditions list.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Minor Conditions: </i>Fascinated, shaken.</li>
				<li><i>Moderate Conditions: </i>Confused, dazed, frightened, sickened.</li>
				<li><i>Greater Conditions: </i>Cowering, nauseated, panicked, stunned.</li>
			</list>
			<p>A 14th level, the mesmerist can instead expend one use of touch treatment to replicate the effects of break enchantment. This targets only one creature the mesmerist is touching and follows all other restrictions of touch treatment.</p>
			<p><b>Manifold Tricks (Su): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can have two tricks implanted at a time. The number of concurrent tricks increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he possesses beyond 5th. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist&#146;s tricks).</p>
			<p><b>Glib Lie (Su): </b>At 11th level, a mesmerist can deceive truthdetecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the mesmerist&#146;s class level to succeed (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn&#146;t detect the mesmerist&#146;s lies or force him to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the mesmerist the glibness spell&#146;s bonus on Bluff checks.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>Rule Minds (Su): </b>At 20th level, a mesmerist can permanently mentally enslave a creature. When the mesmerist successfully affects the target of his hypnotic stare with an enchantment spell that requires a saving throw, he can force that creature to attempt a second Will saving throw with a DC equal to the spell&#146;s DC. The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn&#146;t a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can&#146;t be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>

				<name type="string">Hypnotic Stare</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
					<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
					<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
					<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>While many mesmerists are called to embrace the art of deception, using their mind-binding powers to make their foes believe that even the most outrageous realities are actually true, others indulge in the various hijinks their power enables. These mesmerists are known as vexing tricksters.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Mesmerist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Consummate Trickster (Ex): </b>A vexing trickster gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Disguise, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth checks. This bonus increases by 1 at 4th level and every 3 mesmerist levels thereafter (maximum +6).</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su): </b>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Painful Stare (Su): </b>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>
			<p><b>Trickster&#146;s Ego (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a vexing trickster gains Combat Expertise as a bonus feat. If his Intelligence score is less than 13, his Intelligence counts as 13 for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites for combat feats.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feat (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a vexing trickster gains a trick feat as a bonus feat. He must meet the feat&#146;s prerequisites. At 10th level, he gains a second trick feat as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Bold Stare (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can&#146;t be changed later. The mesmerist can&#146;t choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist&#146;s bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Manifold Tricks (Su): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can have two tricks implanted at a time. The number of concurrent tricks increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he possesses beyond 5th. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist&#146;s tricks).</p>
			<p><b>Mental Potency (Ex): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment or illusion spell he casts increase by 1. For enchantment and illusion spells he casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be). For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>
			<p><b>Manifold Hijinks (Su): </b>At 6th level, the vexing trickster learns to implant multiple mesmerist tricks that have been modified by trick feats (henceforth called modified tricks) in his targets&#146; minds simultaneously. At 6th level, the vexing trickster can implant up to two modified mesmerist tricks in a single target simultaneously. At 14th level, he can implant up to three modified mesmerist tricks in a single target simultaneously. This ability doesn&#146;t allow a mesmerist to apply more than one trick feat to a single mesmerist trick at a time.</p>
			<p><b>Glib Lie (Su): </b>At 11th level, a mesmerist can deceive truthdetecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the mesmerist&#146;s class level to succeed (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn&#146;t detect the mesmerist&#146;s lies or force him to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the mesmerist the glibness spell&#146;s bonus on Bluff checks.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>Rule Minds (Su): </b>At 20th level, a mesmerist can permanently mentally enslave a creature. When the mesmerist successfully affects the target of his hypnotic stare with an enchantment spell that requires a saving throw, he can force that creature to attempt a second Will saving throw with a DC equal to the spell&#146;s DC. The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn&#146;t a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can&#146;t be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level, each time a vexing daredevil successfully feints against a creature under the effect of her hypnotic stare, she also chooses one of her dazzling feint benefits to activate. Unless otherwise stated, a dazzling feint&#146;s benefit applies only on the vexing daredevil&#146;s next attack this round. She selects one dazzling feint at 3rd level and another every 4 levels thereafter. The DC for any saving throw against a dazzling feint&#146;s effect is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vexing daredevil&#146;s class level + her Charisma modifier. The vexing daredevil can&#146;t choose the same dazzling feint more than once.</p>
					<p>Blinding Strike: The vexing daredevil&#146;s weapon emits a bright flash of light into the opponent&#146;s eyes. If the vexing daredevil&#146;s next attack hits, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be blinded for 1 round.</p>
					<p>Combat Maneuver: The vexing daredevil&#146;s attack patterns become more difficult to discern. The vexing daredevil chooses one combat maneuver when making this dazzling feint. For the rest of the round, she doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity when performing that combat maneuver against the target of her dazzling feint. This dazzling feint benefit applies on combat maneuvers instead of on the vexing daredevil&#146;s next attack.</p>
					<p>Critical Strike: Ever alert, the vexing daredevil hones in on the target&#146;s weak points. If her next attack is a critical threat against the target of this dazzling feint, the vexing daredevil gains a circumstance bonus on the roll to confirm that critical hit equal to +1 for every 3 mesmerist levels she possesses.</p>
					<p>Outmanuever: The vexing daredevil&#146;s darting movements foil the target&#146;s attempts to box her in. If her next attack hits, the vexing daredevil gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Acrobatics checks to move through the target&#146;s space or threatened area for 1 round. She can also move up to half her speed after the attack hits as a free action. If she wants to use Acrobatics to move through the target&#146;s threatened area or an enemy&#146;s space during this movement, she must reduce her speed or the DC of the Acrobatics check increases by 10, as normal.</p>
					<p>Piercing Strike: By psychically amplifying the target&#146;s pain, the vexing daredevil causes more damage. If she hits with her next attack and deals damage with her painful stare, she increases the damage dice from d6s to d8s.</p>
					<p>Sloppy Defense: The vexing daredevil&#146;s attacks effortlessly penetrate the target&#146;s defenses; she gains a +1 circumstance bonus on her next attack roll for every 5 mesmerist levels she possesses.</p>
					<p>Surprise Strike: The vexing daredevil creates an opening so she can squeeze in another strike. If her next attack hits, she can make another attack at her highest attack bonus &#150; 5 as a free action. The vexing daredevil must be at least 7th level to select this dazzling feint. This ability replaces bold stare.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Vexing daredevils train their psychic powers for combat, specializing in momentarily blinding and confusing their foes with sudden feints and tricks.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Mesmerist's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Consummate Liar: </b>A mesmerist adds 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Bluff checks. In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesn&#146;t have Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of at least 13. He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater Feint.</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su): </b>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Martial Weapon Proficiency (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a vexing daredevil picks one martial weapon and becomes proficient in its use. This ability replaces the 1st-level mesmerist trick.</p>
			<p><b>Painful Stare (Su): </b>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Towering Ego (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a mesmerist gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 0) on Will saving throws. If the mesmerist is under any effect that would prevent him from providing the emotional component of psychic spells (see page 144), he loses this bonus on saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Dazzling Feint (Su): </b>At 3rd level, each time a vexing daredevil successfully feints against a creature under the effect of her hypnotic stare, she also chooses one of her dazzling feint benefits to activate. Unless otherwise stated, a dazzling feint&#146;s benefit applies only on the vexing daredevil&#146;s next attack this round. She selects one dazzling feint at 3rd level and another every 4 levels thereafter. The DC for any saving throw against a dazzling feint&#146;s effect is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vexing daredevil&#146;s class level + her Charisma modifier. The vexing daredevil can&#146;t choose the same dazzling feint more than once.</p>
			<p><i>Blinding Strike </i>: The vexing daredevil&#146;s weapon emits a bright flash of light into the opponent&#146;s eyes. If the vexing daredevil&#146;s next attack hits, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be blinded for 1 round.</p>
			<p><i>Combat Maneuver </i>: The vexing daredevil&#146;s attack patterns become more difficult to discern. The vexing daredevil chooses one combat maneuver when making this dazzling feint. For the rest of the round, she doesn&#146;t provoke an attack of opportunity when performing that combat maneuver against the target of her dazzling feint. This dazzling feint benefit applies on combat maneuvers instead of on the vexing daredevil&#146;s next attack.</p>
			<p><i>Critical Strike </i>: Ever alert, the vexing daredevil hones in on the target&#146;s weak points. If her next attack is a critical threat against the target of this dazzling feint, the vexing daredevil gains a circumstance bonus on the roll to confirm that critical hit equal to +1 for every 3 mesmerist levels she possesses.</p>
			<p><i>Outmanuever: </i>The vexing daredevil&#146;s darting movements foil the target&#146;s attempts to box her in. If her next attack hits, the vexing daredevil gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Acrobatics checks to move through the target&#146;s space or threatened area for 1 round. She can also move up to half her speed after the attack hits as a free action. If she wants to use Acrobatics to move through the target&#146;s threatened area or an enemy&#146;s space during this movement, she must reduce her speed or the DC of the Acrobatics check increases by 10, as normal.</p>
			<p><i>Piercing Strike: </i>By psychically amplifying the target&#146;s pain, the vexing daredevil causes more damage. If she hits with her next attack and deals damage with her painful stare, she increases the damage dice from d6s to d8s.</p>
			<p><i>Sloppy Defense: </i>The vexing daredevil&#146;s attacks effortlessly penetrate the target&#146;s defenses; she gains a +1 circumstance bonus on her next attack roll for every 5 mesmerist levels she possesses.</p>
			<p><i>Surprise Strike: </i>The vexing daredevil creates an opening so she can squeeze in another strike. If her next attack hits, she can make another attack at her highest attack bonus &#150; 5 as a free action. The vexing daredevil must be at least 7th level to select this dazzling feint. This ability replaces bold stare.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feats: </b>A vexing daredevil gains Improved Feint as a bonus feat at 3rd level, Greater Feint as a bonus feat at 6th level, and Greater Mesmerizing Feint* as a bonus feat at 10th level. She doesn&#146;t need to meet the prerequisites for these feats. At 14th level, she gains a bonus stare feat; she must meet the prerequisites of that feat. These bonus feats replace touch treatment.</p>
			<p><b>Manifold Tricks (Su): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can have two tricks implanted at a time. The number of concurrent tricks increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he possesses beyond 5th. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist&#146;s tricks).</p>
			<p><b>Mental Potency (Ex): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment or illusion spell he casts increase by 1. For enchantment and illusion spells he casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be). For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>
			<p><b>Shimmering Body (Sp): </b>At 11th level, when a vexing daredevil moves in a round, until the beginning of her next turn, any target of her hypnotic stare sees her as a constantly shimmering form of light and treats her as if she were under a blur spell. This ability replaces glib tongue.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>Rule Minds (Su): </b>At 20th level, a mesmerist can permanently mentally enslave a creature. When the mesmerist successfully affects the target of his hypnotic stare with an enchantment spell that requires a saving throw, he can force that creature to attempt a second Will saving throw with a DC equal to the spell&#146;s DC. The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn&#146;t a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can&#146;t be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>

In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesn&#146;t have Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of at least 13. He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater Feint.</p>

				<name type="string">Hypnotic Stare</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>

				<name type="string">Shadow Summoning</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>An umbral mesmerist gains the ability to summon quasi-real creatures as per summon monster I a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. The umbral mesmerist can use this ability as a standard action, and the creatures remain for 1 minute per level (instead of 1 round per level). The creatures summoned are only partly real, but have normal effects unless a creature affected by the illusion succeeds at a Will save to disbelieve (as per shadow conjuration.) The DC for this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the umbral mesmerist&#146;s mesmerist level + the umbral mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier. This is an illusion with the shadowUM descriptor.</p>
					<p>A shadow creature has half the hit points of a normal creature of its kind (regardless of whether it is recognized as a shadow creature). It deals the normal amount of damage and has all of the base creature&#146;s normal abilities and weaknesses. Against a creature that recognizes it as a shadow creature, however, the shadow creature&#146;s damage is halved, and all special abilities that do not deal lethal damage are only 50% likely to work. (Roll for each use and each affected character separately.) Furthermore, the shadow creature&#146;s AC bonuses are halved. A creature that succeeds at its save to disbelieve sees the summoned creature as transparent images superimposed on vague, shadowy forms. Objects automatically succeed at their Will saves against this spell. The umbral mesmerist cannot use this ability to summon creatures from more than one summon monster spell in this way at one time.</p>
					<p>At 4th level and every 4 mesmerist levels thereafter, the power of this ability increases by 1 spell level, allowing the umbral mesmerist to summon more powerful creatures (to a maximum of summon monster VI at 20th level). This ability replaces the mesmerist tricks gained at 1st, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th levels.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
					<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
					<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level, the mesmerist can help allies shake off harmful conditions&#151;especially those that affect their minds&#151;by channeling psychic energy through his healing hands. He can use touch treatment a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the mesmerist uses it on himself ), and the mesmerist must be able to touch his target. He can remove one condition from one target each time he uses this ability. At 3rd level, he can remove any condition on the minor conditions list.

If it succeeds, it can&#146;t be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Trained in secret, umbral mesmerists are clandestine weapons who spend years learning how to shape terrifying creatures from the inky darkness in which they revel.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Mesmerist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Consummate Liar: </b>A mesmerist adds 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Bluff checks. In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesn&#146;t have Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of at least 13. He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater Feint.</p>
			<p><b>Diminished Spellcasting: </b>An umbral mesmerist can cast one fewer spell of each level than normal. If this reduces the number of spells for a level to 0, he can cast spells of that level only if his Charisma score allows bonus spells of that level. This ability alters the mesmerist&#146;s spellcasting.</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su): </b>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Shadow Summoning (Sp): </b>An umbral mesmerist gains the ability to summon quasi-real creatures as per summon monster I a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. The umbral mesmerist can use this ability as a standard action, and the creatures remain for 1 minute per level (instead of 1 round per level). The creatures summoned are only partly real, but have normal effects unless a creature affected by the illusion succeeds at a Will save to disbelieve (as per shadow conjuration.) The DC for this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the umbral mesmerist&#146;s mesmerist level + the umbral mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier. This is an illusion with the shadowUM descriptor.</p>
			<p>A shadow creature has half the hit points of a normal creature of its kind (regardless of whether it is recognized as a shadow creature). It deals the normal amount of damage and has all of the base creature&#146;s normal abilities and weaknesses. Against a creature that recognizes it as a shadow creature, however, the shadow creature&#146;s damage is halved, and all special abilities that do not deal lethal damage are only 50% likely to work. (Roll for each use and each affected character separately.) Furthermore, the shadow creature&#146;s AC bonuses are halved. A creature that succeeds at its save to disbelieve sees the summoned creature as transparent images superimposed on vague, shadowy forms. Objects automatically succeed at their Will saves against this spell. The umbral mesmerist cannot use this ability to summon creatures from more than one summon monster spell in this way at one time.</p>
			<p>At 4th level and every 4 mesmerist levels thereafter, the power of this ability increases by 1 spell level, allowing the umbral mesmerist to summon more powerful creatures (to a maximum of summon monster VI at 20th level). This ability replaces the mesmerist tricks gained at 1st, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Painful Stare (Su): </b>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>
			<p><b>Umbral Solipsism (Su): </b>At 2nd level, when a creature attempts a Will save to disbelieve a quasireal creature created by shadow summoning, it takes a penalty on the save equal to the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier (minimum 0). This ability replaces towering ego.</p>
			<p><b>Bold Stare (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can&#146;t be changed later. The mesmerist can&#146;t choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist&#146;s bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Touch Treatment (Su): </b>At 3rd level, the mesmerist can help allies shake off harmful conditions&#151;especially those that affect their minds&#151;by channeling psychic energy through his healing hands. He can use touch treatment a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the mesmerist uses it on himself ), and the mesmerist must be able to touch his target. He can remove one condition from one target each time he uses this ability. At 3rd level, he can remove any condition on the minor conditions list. At 6th level, he can remove any condition on the minor or moderate conditions list, and at 10th level, he can remove any condition on the minor, moderate, or greater conditions list.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Minor Conditions: </i>Fascinated, shaken.</li>
				<li><i>Moderate Conditions: </i>Confused, dazed, frightened, sickened.</li>
				<li><i>Greater Conditions: </i>Cowering, nauseated, panicked, stunned.</li>
			</list>
			<p>A 14th level, the mesmerist can instead expend one use of touch treatment to replicate the effects of break enchantment. This targets only one creature the mesmerist is touching and follows all other restrictions of touch treatment.</p>
			<p><b>Manifold Tricks (Su): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can have two tricks implanted at a time. The number of concurrent tricks increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he possesses beyond 5th. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist&#146;s tricks).</p>
			<p><b>Ephemeral Stare (Su): </b>At 5th level, the umbral mesmerist is treated as if he were invisible by the target of his hypnotic stare (as per the invisibility spell), provided neither he nor any creatures conjured by shadow summoning take hostile actions against the target. Once the umbral mesmerist or any creature conjured by his shadow summoning ability takes a hostile action against the target, the mesmerist becomes visible to the target and the target cannot be affected again by that umbral mesmerist&#146;s ephemeral stare ability for 24 hours (although it can be affected by other effects of his hypnotic stare). This ability replaces mental potency.</p>
			<p><b>Glib Lie (Su): </b>At 11th level, a mesmerist can deceive truthdetecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the mesmerist&#146;s class level to succeed (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn&#146;t detect the mesmerist&#146;s lies or force him to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the mesmerist the glibness spell&#146;s bonus on Bluff checks.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>Rule Minds (Su): </b>At 20th level, a mesmerist can permanently mentally enslave a creature. When the mesmerist successfully affects the target of his hypnotic stare with an enchantment spell that requires a saving throw, he can force that creature to attempt a second Will saving throw with a DC equal to the spell&#146;s DC. The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn&#146;t a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can&#146;t be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>

				<name type="string">Injections</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, the toxitician uses his skill with alchemy and his own psychic powers to create injections. The toxitician can create a number of injections per day equal to his mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier. It takes 1 hour to create the injections. An injection is inert until the toxitician attempts to use it, taking a swift action to infuse it with his psychic power to activate it.</p>
					<p>Using an injection requires taking a standard action to attempt a melee touch attack. If the attack hits, the target of an injection takes a &#150;2 penalty on its Will saving throws for a number of minutes equal to 1/2 the toxitican&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The penalty becomes &#150;3 at 8th level. The toxitician can simultaneously attempt a DC 20 Sleight of Hand check to inject the target surreptitiously. If the toxitician uses Sleight of Hand, the target can attempt a Perception check to detect the attempt, opposed by the Sleight of Hand check result, but detecting the attempt doesn&#146;t prevent the creature from being injected. Whenever the toxitician uses Sleight of Hand to administer one of his injections, he can implant it rather than injecting it and then trigger the effect of the injection at a later time. At any point before he regains his injections, the toxitician can trigger an implanted injection as a free action. The toxitician must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per mesmerist level) of the target of the implanted injection.</p>
					<p>If either the melee touch attack or the Sleight of Hand check (if attempted) fails, the injection isn&#146;t delivered but can still be used again&#151;once activated, it remains potent for 1 day. An injection that hasn&#146;t been administered becomes inert if it leaves the toxitician&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping.</p>
					<p>The penalties from multiple injections don&#146;t stack, nor do the penalties from injections stack with penalties from mesmerist stares or witches&#146; evil eye hexes. Injections are mind-affecting effects.</p>
					<p>This ability replaces hypnotic stare.</p>

Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
					<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
					<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>

				<name type="string">Mesmerist Trick</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
					<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
					<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>The toxitician&#146;s injection causes intense pain. This increases the damage the subject takes in the same way as the mesmerist&#146;s painful stare class feature. This extra damage is dealt automatically, without being triggered by the toxitician, but doesn&#146;t increase when the toxitician damages the target and can still be dealt only once per round. This ability replaces painful stare.</p>

For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>

The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn&#146;t a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can&#146;t be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.</p>

			<p><i>Toxiticians forgo the mesmerist&#146;s stare, instead combining their psychic power with their alchemical knowledge to craft injections that torment their foes and bolster themselves and their allies.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Mesmerist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Deft Fingers (Ex): </b>A toxitician adds 1/2 his class level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Sleight of Hands checks. This ability replaces consummate liar.</p>
			<p><b>Injections (Su): </b>At 1st level, the toxitician uses his skill with alchemy and his own psychic powers to create injections. The toxitician can create a number of injections per day equal to his mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier. It takes 1 hour to create the injections. An injection is inert until the toxitician attempts to use it, taking a swift action to infuse it with his psychic power to activate it.</p>
			<p>Using an injection requires taking a standard action to attempt a melee touch attack. If the attack hits, the target of an injection takes a &#150;2 penalty on its Will saving throws for a number of minutes equal to 1/2 the toxitican&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The penalty becomes &#150;3 at 8th level. The toxitician can simultaneously attempt a DC 20 Sleight of Hand check to inject the target surreptitiously. If the toxitician uses Sleight of Hand, the target can attempt a Perception check to detect the attempt, opposed by the Sleight of Hand check result, but detecting the attempt doesn&#146;t prevent the creature from being injected. Whenever the toxitician uses Sleight of Hand to administer one of his injections, he can implant it rather than injecting it and then trigger the effect of the injection at a later time. At any point before he regains his injections, the toxitician can trigger an implanted injection as a free action. The toxitician must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per mesmerist level) of the target of the implanted injection.</p>
			<p>If either the melee touch attack or the Sleight of Hand check (if attempted) fails, the injection isn&#146;t delivered but can still be used again&#151;once activated, it remains potent for 1 day. An injection that hasn&#146;t been administered becomes inert if it leaves the toxitician&#146;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping.</p>
			<p>The penalties from multiple injections don&#146;t stack, nor do the penalties from injections stack with penalties from mesmerist stares or witches&#146; evil eye hexes. Injections are mind-affecting effects.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Painful Injection (Su): </b>The toxitician&#146;s injection causes intense pain. This increases the damage the subject takes in the same way as the mesmerist&#146;s painful stare class feature. This extra damage is dealt automatically, without being triggered by the toxitician, but doesn&#146;t increase when the toxitician damages the target and can still be dealt only once per round. This ability replaces painful stare.</p>
			<p><b>Towering Ego (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a mesmerist gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 0) on Will saving throws. If the mesmerist is under any effect that would prevent him from providing the emotional component of psychic spells (see page 144), he loses this bonus on saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Injection Improvement (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a toxitician can select one improvement to add to his injections. The toxitician can&#146;t choose the same improvement more than once. The toxitician doesn&#146;t have to select the improvements when he prepares his injections at the start of the day; the choice is made as part of the swift action to activate the injection. The target can attempt a Fortitude saving throw to resist an injection with an improvement added to it. The DC is 10 + 1/2 the toxitician&#146;s class level + the toxitician&#146;s Charisma modifier. On a successful save, the target still takes the penalty on its Will saving throws, but not the effects of the improvement. A toxitician can, as a free action, sacrifice one use of his injections to increase the DC of another injection by 2.</p>
			<p>Ability Decrease: The target takes a &#150;2 penalty to one ability score of the toxitician&#146;s choosing. At 11th level, the penalty becomes &#150;4.</p>
			<p>Excruciating: The extra damage from painful injection increases by an amount equal to 2 points + 1 point per 3 mesmerist levels the toxitician possesses.</p>
			<p>Fortitude Decrease: The target&#146;s immune system weakens, imposing a &#150;2 penalty on Fortitude saving throws. At 11th level, the penalty becomes &#150;4.</p>
			<p>Natural Armor Decrease: The target&#146;s skin becomes looser, decreasing its natural armor (if any) by 2. At 11th level, its natural armor bonus instead decreases by 4.</p>
			<p>Reflex Decrease: The target&#146;s body becomes stiffer, imposing a &#150;2 penalty on the target&#146;s Reflex saving throws. At 11th level, the penalty becomes &#150;4.</p>
			<p>Slow: The target&#146;s actions become sluggish, reducing its base movement by 10 feet and imposing a &#150;1 penalty on attack rolls. At 11th level, the penalty on attack rolls becomes &#150;2.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces bold stare.</p>
			<p><b>Touch Treatment (Su): </b>At 3rd level, the mesmerist can help allies shake off harmful conditions&#151;especially those that affect their minds&#151;by channeling psychic energy through his healing hands. He can use touch treatment a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the mesmerist uses it on himself ), and the mesmerist must be able to touch his target. He can remove one condition from one target each time he uses this ability. At 3rd level, he can remove any condition on the minor conditions list. At 6th level, he can remove any condition on the minor or moderate conditions list, and at 10th level, he can remove any condition on the minor, moderate, or greater conditions list.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Minor Conditions: </i>Fascinated, shaken.</li>
				<li><i>Moderate Conditions: </i>Confused, dazed, frightened, sickened.</li>
				<li><i>Greater Conditions: </i>Cowering, nauseated, panicked, stunned.</li>
			</list>
			<p>A 14th level, the mesmerist can instead expend one use of touch treatment to replicate the effects of break enchantment. This targets only one creature the mesmerist is touching and follows all other restrictions of touch treatment.</p>
			<p><b>Treatment Vials (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a toxitician can create treatment vials when he creates his injections for the day; creating each treatment vial expends one use of touch treatment. A treatment vial has the same benefit as his touch treatment, but anyone can administer it as a standard action. A vial can remove any condition the toxitician is able to remove at his mesmerist level, but can&#146;t be used for a break enchantment effect. A treatment vial becomes inert after 24 hours. This ability alters touch treatment.</p>
			<p><b>Manifold Tricks (Su): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can have two tricks implanted at a time. The number of concurrent tricks increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he possesses beyond 5th. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist&#146;s tricks).</p>
			<p><b>Mental Potency (Ex): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment or illusion spell he casts increase by 1. For enchantment and illusion spells he casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be). For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Injections (Su): </b>At 11th level, the toxitician can add two different improvements to an injection. The injection still requires only one save. This ability replaces glib lie.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>Rule Minds (Su): </b>At 20th level, a mesmerist can permanently mentally enslave a creature. When the mesmerist successfully affects the target of his hypnotic stare with an enchantment spell that requires a saving throw, he can force that creature to attempt a second Will saving throw with a DC equal to the spell&#146;s DC. The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn&#146;t a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can&#146;t be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.</p>

				<name type="string">Hypnotic Stare</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
					<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
					<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level, the thought eater can choose one Knowledge skill possessed by the target of his hypnotic stare. He uses the target&#146;s number of ranks in that skill, instead of his own, to calculate his bonus (but not for other purposes, such as meeting the prerequisites of feats) to a maximum number of ranks equal to his mesmerist level.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Mesmerists that learn to pierce deep into the minds of their victims are known as thought eaters, dangerous individuals capable of devouring thoughts and assuming the knowledge those notions represent for themselves.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Mesmerist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Assume Identity (Su): </b>When a thought eater targets a creature with his hypnotic stare ability, the thought eater gains a bonus on Disguise checks to appear as that creature. This bonus is equal to the thought eater&#146;s mesmerist level, and lasts for 24 hours, or until he uses his hypnotic stare ability on a different creature.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces consummate liar.</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su): </b>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Painful Stare (Su): </b>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>
			<p><b>Assume Morality (Su): </b>At 2nd level, the thought eater&#146;s alignment matches that of the target of his assume identity ability for the purposes of spells and effects that discern alignment. This includes any increase to alignment aura strength from class features, such as a cleric&#146;s aura ability.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces towering ego.</p>
			<p><b>Bold Stare (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can&#146;t be changed later. The mesmerist can&#146;t choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist&#146;s bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Assume Knowledge (Su): </b>At 3rd level, the thought eater can choose one Knowledge skill possessed by the target of his hypnotic stare. He uses the target&#146;s number of ranks in that skill, instead of his own, to calculate his bonus (but not for other purposes, such as meeting the prerequisites of feats) to a maximum number of ranks equal to his mesmerist level. This ability lasts for 24 hours or until he uses his hypnotic stare ability on a different creature.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces touch treatment.</p>
			<p><b>Manifold Tricks (Su): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can have two tricks implanted at a time. The number of concurrent tricks increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he possesses beyond 5th. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist&#146;s tricks).</p>
			<p><b>Mental Potency (Ex): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment or illusion spell he casts increase by 1. For enchantment and illusion spells he casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be). For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>
			<p><b>Glib Lie (Su): </b>At 11th level, a mesmerist can deceive truthdetecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the mesmerist&#146;s class level to succeed (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn&#146;t detect the mesmerist&#146;s lies or force him to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the mesmerist the glibness spell&#146;s bonus on Bluff checks.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>Consume Identity (Su): </b>At 20th level, when the thought eater kills a target of his hypnotic stare, he can choose to entirely consume the creature&#146;s identity, mind, body, and soul as a free action. The target&#146;s corpse dissolves and as long as the thought eater lives, the target of consume identity cannot be brought back from the dead until the thought eater releases the identity (a standard action) or uses consume identity on another target. The creature&#146;s soul can also be released by a wish or miracle (which ends the effect of consume identity). When the thought eater has consumed an identity, all divination spells identify him as (and consider him to be) the creature whose identity he consumed rather than himself. This ability fools any spell short of discern location. Discern location pinpoints the thought eater&#146;s location, whenever either the thought eater or the consumed creature is the target of that spell.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
					<p>A spirit walker adds additional spells to his spell list at the spell levels indicated: hide from undead (1st), command undead (2nd), halt undead (3rd), and speak with hauntACG (4th). He can choose these as spells known, but doesn&#146;t gain them automatically. This ability alters the mesmerist&#146;s spell list.</p>

				<name type="string">Undead Inception</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a spirit walker can affect undead creatures with his hypnotic stare as the psychic inception bold stare ability. This allows him to affect only undead; he must actually choose the psychic inception bold stare improvement if he wants to also affect other mindless creatures. At 3rd level when the spirit walker uses this ability, undead targets don&#146;t receive a saving throw bonus (if they did to begin with), have only a 25% chance of ignoring the spirit walker&#146;s mind-affecting spells and abilities, and no longer need to be under the spirit walker&#146;s gaze to be affected. At 5th level, when the spirit walker uses his mind-affecting spells and abilities, they affect all undead normally, with no chance of failure. This ability replaces consummate liar and mental potency.</p>

				<name type="string">Hypnotic Stare</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>

				<name type="string">Mesmerist Trick</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
					<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
					<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>

					<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>

				<name type="string">Painful Stare</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level, when a spirit walker is using hypnotic stare on a humanoid target and the target dies, as an immediate action the spirit walker can force the target&#146;s soul to remain in the body. The spirit walker can then control the target as if using dominate person for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 the spirit walker&#146;s class level. The creature gains a number of temporary hit points equal to 2 &#215; the spirit walker&#146;s class level and continues acting as though it were alive and conscious until it loses those temporary hit points or the duration expires. During this time, the creature counts as undead, but it can&#146;t be healed by negative energy. The spirit walker can use this ability once per day for every 3 mesmerist levels he possesses. The target receives a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the spirit walker&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier) to avoid this effect and die normally. This ability ends immediately if at any point the target&#146;s body is completely destroyed (such as by disintegrate) or restored to life. At 14th level, the spirit walker can apply this ability to any type of target as if using dominate monster. This ability replaces the 3rd- and 14th-level touch treatments.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some mesmerists specialize in dominating and controlling undead rather than the living.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Mesmerist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p>A spirit walker adds additional spells to his spell list at the spell levels indicated: hide from undead (1st), command undead (2nd), halt undead (3rd), and speak with haunt (4th). He can choose these as spells known, but doesn&#146;t gain them automatically. This ability alters the mesmerist&#146;s spell list.</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su): </b>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Painful Stare (Su): </b>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>
			<p><b>Undead Inception (Su): </b>At 1st level, a spirit walker can affect undead creatures with his hypnotic stare as the psychic inception bold stare ability. This allows him to affect only undead; he must actually choose the psychic inception bold stare improvement if he wants to also affect other mindless creatures. At 3rd level when the spirit walker uses this ability, undead targets don&#146;t receive a saving throw bonus (if they did to begin with), have only a 25% chance of ignoring the spirit walker&#146;s mind-affecting spells and abilities, and no longer need to be under the spirit walker&#146;s gaze to be affected. At 5th level, when the spirit walker uses his mind-affecting spells and abilities, they affect all undead normally, with no chance of failure. This ability replaces consummate liar and mental potency.</p>
			<p><b>Towering Ego (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a mesmerist gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 0) on Will saving throws. If the mesmerist is under any effect that would prevent him from providing the emotional component of psychic spells (see page 144), he loses this bonus on saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Bold Stare (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can&#146;t be changed later. The mesmerist can&#146;t choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist&#146;s bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Continued Animation (Su): </b>At 3rd level, when a spirit walker is using hypnotic stare on a humanoid target and the target dies, as an immediate action the spirit walker can force the target&#146;s soul to remain in the body. The spirit walker can then control the target as if using dominate person for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 the spirit walker&#146;s class level. The creature gains a number of temporary hit points equal to 2 &#215; the spirit walker&#146;s class level and continues acting as though it were alive and conscious until it loses those temporary hit points or the duration expires. During this time, the creature counts as undead, but it can&#146;t be healed by negative energy. The spirit walker can use this ability once per day for every 3 mesmerist levels he possesses. The target receives a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the spirit walker&#146;s class level + his Charisma modifier) to avoid this effect and die normally. This ability ends immediately if at any point the target&#146;s body is completely destroyed (such as by disintegrate) or restored to life. At 14th level, the spirit walker can apply this ability to any type of target as if using dominate monster. This ability replaces the 3rd- and 14th-level touch treatments.</p>
			<p><b>Manifold Tricks (Su): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can have two tricks implanted at a time. The number of concurrent tricks increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he possesses beyond 5th. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist&#146;s tricks).</p>
			<p><b>Command Undead (Su): </b>At 6th level, a spirit walker gains Command Undead as a bonus feat. A spirit walker can use Command Undead a number of times per day equal to 1 + his Charisma modifier (minimum 1), using his mesmerist level as his cleric level. At 10th level, the DC to resist this effect increases by 2. This ability replaces the 6th- and 10th-level touch treatments.</p>
			<p><b>Glib Lie (Su): </b>At 11th level, a mesmerist can deceive truthdetecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the mesmerist&#146;s class level to succeed (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn&#146;t detect the mesmerist&#146;s lies or force him to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the mesmerist the glibness spell&#146;s bonus on Bluff checks.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>Master of the Dead (Su): </b>At 20th level, a spirit walker gains mastery of the undead. Once per day, a spirit walker can use control undead as a spell-like ability on one target. If that creature fails its saving throw and has 20 or fewer Hit Dice, it falls permanently under the spirit walker&#146;s control until the spirit walker dies. A creature that fails its save but has more than 20 HD suffers the effect of command undead. A creature that succeeds at its save can&#146;t be affected by master of the dead for 24 hours. A spirit walker can control only one undead creature in this fashion at a time. If he permanently controls a new undead creature, the previous one is set free. This ability replaces rule minds.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
					<p>A projectionist&#146;s psychic powers manifest in an almost predictable manner, making them less versatile than other spellcasters. At each of the indicated levels, a projectionist must choose the indicated spell to learn&#151;he cannot choose other spells. The spells that a projectionist must learn (and the level at which he must choose them) are enter imageAPG(4th), lesser object possessionOA (7th), riding possessionOA (10th), object possessionOA (13th), and greater object possessionOA (16th). The projectionist adds greater object possession to his spell list as a 6th-level spell.</p>

In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesn&#146;t have Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of at least 13. He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater Feint.</p>

				<name type="string">Hypnotic Stare</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>

				<name type="string">Mesmerist Trick</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
					<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
					<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again.

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, a projectionist can spend one use of his mesmerist trick ability to create a psychic link between himself and one object that bears his likeness, such as a painting or a statue. This functions in all ways like implanting a mesmerist trick in a creature, except the target is an object. The projectionist can trigger the trick as a standard action at any time&#151;upon doing so, his consciousness leaves his body and fills the target object, functioning as described by the &#147;filling an image with your consciousness&#148; use of the enter image spell (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&#146;s Guide 219). Use the projectionist&#146;s mesmerist level as the spell&#146;s caster level. While filling an image with his consciousness, the projectionist can use and maintain his hypnotic stare on opponents, and can also trigger his painful stare. At 8th level, he can also use any purely mental action (including casting psychic spells) while filling an object with his consciousness.</p>
					<p>Once he implants this trick in an object, the projectionist can fill the target with his consciousness whenever he pleases, regardless of distance or whether he is on the same plane as his target. Once he stops concentrating on maintaining the enter image effect, his consciousness returns to his body and he cannot fill the target with his consciousness again until he implants another mesmerist trick in that object.</p>
					<p>This ability replaces the mesmerist tricks gained at 4th and 8th levels.</p>

Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>

				<name type="string">Painful Stare</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Not content to simply command others from afar, a projectionist is able to use his mesmerizing powers to utterly dominate other creatures and objects by projecting his spirit from his body.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Mesmerist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p>A projectionist&#146;s psychic powers manifest in an almost predictable manner, making them less versatile than other spellcasters. At each of the indicated levels, a projectionist must choose the indicated spell to learn&#151;he cannot choose other spells. The spells that a projectionist must learn (and the level at which he must choose them) are enter imageAPG(4th), lesser object possessionOA (7th), riding possessionOA (10th), object possessionOA (13th), and greater object possessionOA (16th). The projectionist adds greater object possession to his spell list as a 6th-level spell.</p>
			<p><b>Consummate Liar: </b>A mesmerist adds 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Bluff checks. In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesn&#146;t have Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of at least 13. He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater Feint.</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su): </b>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Painful Stare (Su): </b>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>
			<p><b>Towering Ego (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a mesmerist gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 0) on Will saving throws. If the mesmerist is under any effect that would prevent him from providing the emotional component of psychic spells (see page 144), he loses this bonus on saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Bold Stare (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can&#146;t be changed later. The mesmerist can&#146;t choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist&#146;s bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Touch Treatment (Su): </b>At 3rd level, the mesmerist can help allies shake off harmful conditions&#151;especially those that affect their minds&#151;by channeling psychic energy through his healing hands. He can use touch treatment a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the mesmerist uses it on himself ), and the mesmerist must be able to touch his target. He can remove one condition from one target each time he uses this ability. At 3rd level, he can remove any condition on the minor conditions list. At 6th level, he can remove any condition on the minor or moderate conditions list, and at 10th level, he can remove any condition on the minor, moderate, or greater conditions list.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Minor Conditions: </i>Fascinated, shaken.</li>
				<li><i>Moderate Conditions: </i>Confused, dazed, frightened, sickened.</li>
				<li><i>Greater Conditions: </i>Cowering, nauseated, panicked, stunned.</li>
			</list>
			<p>A 14th level, the mesmerist can instead expend one use of touch treatment to replicate the effects of break enchantment. This targets only one creature the mesmerist is touching and follows all other restrictions of touch treatment.</p>
			<p><b>Implant Consciousness (Su): </b>At 4th level, a projectionist can spend one use of his mesmerist trick ability to create a psychic link between himself and one object that bears his likeness, such as a painting or a statue. This functions in all ways like implanting a mesmerist trick in a creature, except the target is an object. The projectionist can trigger the trick as a standard action at any time&#151;upon doing so, his consciousness leaves his body and fills the target object, functioning as described by the &#147;filling an image with your consciousness&#148; use of the enter image spell (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&#146;s Guide 219). Use the projectionist&#146;s mesmerist level as the spell&#146;s caster level. While filling an image with his consciousness, the projectionist can use and maintain his hypnotic stare on opponents, and can also trigger his painful stare. At 8th level, he can also use any purely mental action (including casting psychic spells) while filling an object with his consciousness.</p>
			<p>Once he implants this trick in an object, the projectionist can fill the target with his consciousness whenever he pleases, regardless of distance or whether he is on the same plane as his target. Once he stops concentrating on maintaining the enter image effect, his consciousness returns to his body and he cannot fill the target with his consciousness again until he implants another mesmerist trick in that object.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the mesmerist tricks gained at 4th and 8th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Hidden Presence: </b>At 5th level, a projectionist gains Hidden PresenceOA as a bonus feat. He doesn&#146;t need to meet the feat&#146;s prerequisites. He benefits from Hidden Presence and feats that list Hidden Presence as a prerequisite while possessing objects (as with object possessionOA) or while filling an object with his consciousness (as described in the enter imageAPG spell), as well as when he possesses creatures, provided the feat is applicable. For instance, Intrusive PresenceOA cannot be used to read the mind of an inanimate object possessed via enter image or object possession, as objects possess no minds to be read.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the mesmerist&#146;s mental potency.</p>
			<p><b>Manifold Tricks (Su): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can have two tricks implanted at a time. The number of concurrent tricks increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he possesses beyond 5th. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist&#146;s tricks).</p>
			<p><b>Glib Lie (Su): </b>At 11th level, a mesmerist can deceive truthdetecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the mesmerist&#146;s class level to succeed (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn&#146;t detect the mesmerist&#146;s lies or force him to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the mesmerist the glibness spell&#146;s bonus on Bluff checks.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>Rule Minds (Su): </b>At 20th level, a mesmerist can permanently mentally enslave a creature. When the mesmerist successfully affects the target of his hypnotic stare with an enchantment spell that requires a saving throw, he can force that creature to attempt a second Will saving throw with a DC equal to the spell&#146;s DC. The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn&#146;t a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can&#146;t be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.</p>

				<name type="string">Phantasmagorical Breath</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a mindwyrm mesmer has learned to mimic a true dragon&#146;s destructive breath using his psychic ability. A number of times per day equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 1 per day), a mindwyrm mesmer can unleash his phantasmagoric breath in either a 30-foot cone or a 60-foot line as a standard action. The breath induces a psychosomatic response in creatures caught in the area, dealing 1d6 points of energy damage at 1st level, plus an additional 1d6 points of energy damage at 3rd level and for every 2 mesmerist levels thereafter. The mindwyrm mesmer selects the type of energy damage this deals (acid, cold, electricity, or fire) when this ability is first gained; once made, this choice can&#146;t be changed. Creatures affected can attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the mindwyrm mesmer&#146;s mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier) to realize the true nature of the attack, which negates all damage. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
					<p>This ability replaces painful stare.</p>

					<p>At 5th level, the mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment or illusion spell he casts increase by 1. For enchantment and illusion spells he casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be). For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>While most mesmerists are subtle and manipulative schemers, mindwyrm mesmers emulate the confidence, swagger, and fear inspired by dragons to bully and browbeat others into obedience. These dragon-inspired psychic magic-users typically employ draconic imagery in their dress and the manifestations of their powers.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Mesmerist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Consummate Liar: </b>A mesmerist adds 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Bluff checks. In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesn&#146;t have Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of at least 13. He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater Feint.</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su): </b>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Draconic Trick (Su): </b>The following new trick can be selected by a mindwyrm mesmer.</p>
			<p><i>Threatening Mien: </i>The subject&#146;s actions appear to be lethal in the extreme. A mindwyrm mesmer can trigger this trick when the subject moves adjacent to an enemy. Enemies adjacent to the subject take a -4 penalty on attacks against targets other than the subject. This trick lasts for 1 round per mindwyrm mesmer&#146;s mesmerist level.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Painful Stare (Su): </b>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>
			<p><b>Towering Ego (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a mesmerist gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 0) on Will saving throws. If the mesmerist is under any effect that would prevent him from providing the emotional component of psychic spells (see page 144), he loses this bonus on saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Bold Stare (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can&#146;t be changed later. The mesmerist can&#146;t choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist&#146;s bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Touch Treatment (Su): </b>At 3rd level, the mesmerist can help allies shake off harmful conditions&#151;especially those that affect their minds&#151;by channeling psychic energy through his healing hands. He can use touch treatment a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the mesmerist uses it on himself ), and the mesmerist must be able to touch his target. He can remove one condition from one target each time he uses this ability. At 3rd level, he can remove any condition on the minor conditions list. At 6th level, he can remove any condition on the minor or moderate conditions list, and at 10th level, he can remove any condition on the minor, moderate, or greater conditions list.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Minor Conditions: </i>Fascinated, shaken.</li>
				<li><i>Moderate Conditions: </i>Confused, dazed, frightened, sickened.</li>
				<li><i>Greater Conditions: </i>Cowering, nauseated, panicked, stunned.</li>
			</list>
			<p>A 14th level, the mesmerist can instead expend one use of touch treatment to replicate the effects of break enchantment. This targets only one creature the mesmerist is touching and follows all other restrictions of touch treatment.</p>
			<p><b>Manifold Tricks (Su): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can have two tricks implanted at a time. The number of concurrent tricks increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he possesses beyond 5th. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist&#146;s tricks).</p>
			<p><b>Mental Potency (Ex): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment or illusion spell he casts increase by 1. For enchantment and illusion spells he casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be). For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>
			<p><b>Glib Lie (Su): </b>At 11th level, a mesmerist can deceive truthdetecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the mesmerist&#146;s class level to succeed (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn&#146;t detect the mesmerist&#146;s lies or force him to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the mesmerist the glibness spell&#146;s bonus on Bluff checks.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Draconic Trick (Su): </b>The following new masterful trick can be selected by a mindwyrm mesmer of 12th level or higher.</p>
			<p><i>Frightful Countenance: </i>The subject&#146;s appearance changes into that which frightens an attacker to the core. The mindwyrm mesmer can trigger this trick when the subject is targeted by an attack or by a spell that requires an attack roll. The attacker must succeed at a Will save or the attack misses and the attacker immediately becomes shaken for 1d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>Rule Minds (Su): </b>At 20th level, a mesmerist can permanently mentally enslave a creature. When the mesmerist successfully affects the target of his hypnotic stare with an enchantment spell that requires a saving throw, he can force that creature to attempt a second Will saving throw with a DC equal to the spell&#146;s DC. The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn&#146;t a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can&#146;t be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>

				<name type="string">Hypnotic Stare</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
					<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
					<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>

					<p>At 2nd level, a mesmerist gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 0) on Will saving throws. If the mesmerist is under any effect that would prevent him from providing the emotional component of psychic spells (see page 144), he loses this bonus on saving throws.</p>

				<name type="string">Revision</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 3rd level, a material manipulator can revise a creature&#146;s body to change its appearance. He can use revision a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Using revision is a standard action (or a swift action if the material manipulator uses it on himself ), and the material manipulator must be able to touch his target. An unwilling target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the material manipulator&#146;s mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier) to negate the effect.</p>
					<p>At 3rd level, the material manipulator can adjust the target&#146;s height and weight, increasing it or decreasing it to any height or weight within the standard range for creatures of the target&#146;s type and size category (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 169). At 6th level, he can adjust the target&#146;s gender, physical traits (such as nose size, fingernail length, and foot shape), and pigmentation (including eye, hair, and skin color) to any natural variation for creatures of the target&#146;s type (and heritage, if applicable). At 10th level, he can adjust the target&#146;s age, rewinding the target&#146;s age to as young as a young adult (approximately 8 years old for a human) or progressing it to as old as venerable. This causes the target to gain aging bonuses and penalties and adjust its size as appropriate for its new age, but doesn&#146;t confer any other benefits gained from aging (such as additional racial Hit Dice, supernatural abilities, and so on). At 14th level, he can adjust the target&#146;s type or subtype, as per polymorph. At 20th level, he can instead adjust the target&#146;s type as per greater polymorph. This ability is a polymorph effect, and the subject of a revision cannot end the effect early by any means unless the material manipulator permits it. The material manipulator can stack multiple adjustments from this ability into the same polymorph effect&#151;for instance, a 14th-level material manipulator can adjust himself into an orc, reduce his age to that of a young adult, give himself large feet and a bulbous nose, and change his gender.</p>
					<p>This effect lasts for 10 minutes per mesmerist level. At 10th level, the effect lasts for 1 hour per mesmerist level, or 1 minute per level if he uses it as polymorph. At 20th level, the effect lasts indefinitely, or 10 minutes per mesmerist level if the material manipulator uses it as greater polymorph and causes the target to assume a form with a different type than its true form. The mesmerist can dismiss this effect as a free action.</p>
					<p>Clothing and equipment worn by the target is not affected by this effect&#151;gear does not resize to suit the wearer&#146;s new form, nor does it merge into her body. Gear unable to be worn or wielded as a result of this effect falls to the ground in the wearer&#146;s space.</p>
					<p>This ability replaces touch treatment and rule minds.</p>

For enchantment and illusion spells he casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be). For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Rather than waste time limiting himself to ruling minds, a material manipulator forces his whims upon reality and uses his magic to ensure that those around him comply with his demands.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Mesmerist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su): </b>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Manipulator Spells: </b>A material manipulator casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list and augmented by a select list of sorcerer/wizard spells. All illusion (glamer), illusion (shadow), and transmutation spells of 6th level and lower are considered to be part of the material manipulator&#146;s spell list. These are psychic spells.</p>
			<p>This ability alters the mesmerist&#146;s spellcasting and replaces consummate liar, the mesmerist trick gained at 2nd level, and manifold tricks.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Painful Stare (Su): </b>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>
			<p><b>Towering Ego (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a mesmerist gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 0) on Will saving throws. If the mesmerist is under any effect that would prevent him from providing the emotional component of psychic spells (see page 144), he loses this bonus on saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Bold Stare (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can&#146;t be changed later. The mesmerist can&#146;t choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist&#146;s bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Revision (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a material manipulator can revise a creature&#146;s body to change its appearance. He can use revision a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Using revision is a standard action (or a swift action if the material manipulator uses it on himself ), and the material manipulator must be able to touch his target. An unwilling target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the material manipulator&#146;s mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier) to negate the effect.</p>
			<p>At 3rd level, the material manipulator can adjust the target&#146;s height and weight, increasing it or decreasing it to any height or weight within the standard range for creatures of the target&#146;s type and size category (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 169). At 6th level, he can adjust the target&#146;s gender, physical traits (such as nose size, fingernail length, and foot shape), and pigmentation (including eye, hair, and skin color) to any natural variation for creatures of the target&#146;s type (and heritage, if applicable). At 10th level, he can adjust the target&#146;s age, rewinding the target&#146;s age to as young as a young adult (approximately 8 years old for a human) or progressing it to as old as venerable. This causes the target to gain aging bonuses and penalties and adjust its size as appropriate for its new age, but doesn&#146;t confer any other benefits gained from aging (such as additional racial Hit Dice, supernatural abilities, and so on). At 14th level, he can adjust the target&#146;s type or subtype, as per polymorph. At 20th level, he can instead adjust the target&#146;s type as per greater polymorph. This ability is a polymorph effect, and the subject of a revision cannot end the effect early by any means unless the material manipulator permits it. The material manipulator can stack multiple adjustments from this ability into the same polymorph effect&#151;for instance, a 14th-level material manipulator can adjust himself into an orc, reduce his age to that of a young adult, give himself large feet and a bulbous nose, and change his gender.</p>
			<p>This effect lasts for 10 minutes per mesmerist level. At 10th level, the effect lasts for 1 hour per mesmerist level, or 1 minute per level if he uses it as polymorph. At 20th level, the effect lasts indefinitely, or 10 minutes per mesmerist level if the material manipulator uses it as greater polymorph and causes the target to assume a form with a different type than its true form. The mesmerist can dismiss this effect as a free action.</p>
			<p>Clothing and equipment worn by the target is not affected by this effect&#151;gear does not resize to suit the wearer&#146;s new form, nor does it merge into her body. Gear unable to be worn or wielded as a result of this effect falls to the ground in the wearer&#146;s space.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces touch treatment and rule minds.</p>
			<p><b>Mental Potency (Ex): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment or illusion spell he casts increase by 1. For enchantment and illusion spells he casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be). For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>
			<p><b>Glib Lie (Su): </b>At 11th level, a mesmerist can deceive truthdetecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the mesmerist&#146;s class level to succeed (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn&#146;t detect the mesmerist&#146;s lies or force him to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the mesmerist the glibness spell&#146;s bonus on Bluff checks.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>

					<p>A hate-monger masters a broad repertoire of emotional corruption. At 1st level, he adds one spell from the 1st-level spells below to his spells known. When he would gain a new mesmerist trick, he can learn additional spells instead, adding two of the following spells of a level he can currently cast to his spells known: 1st&#151;cause fear, compel hostilityUC, delusional prideUM, demand offeringOA, forbid actionUM, lesser confusion, murderous commandUM, scare, sow thoughtARG; 2nd&#151;aversionOA, paranoiaOA, rage, unadulterated loathingUM; 3rd&#151; confusion, crushing despair, curse of disgustUM, fear, instant enemyAPG, malicious spiteUM, smug narcissismUM, spiteAPG; 4th&#151;envious urgeUM, feast on fearARG, greater forbid actionUM, modify memory, utter contemptUM; 5th&#151;foe to friendAPG, foster hatredOA, song of discord, repress memoryOA, unwilling shieldAPG, vengeful outrageUM; 6th&#151; eyebite, insanity, overwhelming presenceUM, symbol of persuasion. When he casts a spell he learns in this way, he increases the duration as if his caster level were 1 higher. Starting at 5th level, the save DC is increased by 1 for creatures of his favored enemy type.</p>

				<name type="string">Hypnotic Stare</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
					<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
					<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>

				<name type="string">Painful Stare</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Hate-mongers are xenophobic and judgmental rabblerousers who whip up mobs against enemies real or imagined.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>A hate-monger must be of a nongood alignment. A hate-monger who becomes good cannot gain new levels as a mesmerist but retains all his class abilities.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Mesmerist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Consummate Liar: </b>A mesmerist adds 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Bluff checks. In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesn&#146;t have Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of at least 13. He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater Feint.</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su): </b>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Mental Manipulator (Ex): </b>A hate-monger masters a broad repertoire of emotional corruption. At 1st level, he adds one spell from the 1st-level spells below to his spells known. When he would gain a new mesmerist trick, he can learn additional spells instead, adding two of the following spells of a level he can currently cast to his spells known: 1st&#151;cause fear, compel hostilityUC, delusional prideUM, demand offeringOA, forbid actionUM, lesser confusion, murderous commandUM, scare, sow thoughtARG; 2nd&#151;aversionOA, paranoiaOA, rage, unadulterated loathingUM; 3rd&#151; confusion, crushing despair, curse of disgustUM, fear, instant enemyAPG, malicious spiteUM, smug narcissismUM, spiteAPG; 4th&#151;envious urgeUM, feast on fearARG, greater forbid actionUM, modify memory, utter contemptUM; 5th&#151;foe to friendAPG, foster hatredOA, song of discord, repress memoryOA, unwilling shieldAPG, vengeful outrageUM; 6th&#151; eyebite, insanity, overwhelming presenceUM, symbol of persuasion. When he casts a spell he learns in this way, he increases the duration as if his caster level were 1 higher. Starting at 5th level, the save DC is increased by 1 for creatures of his favored enemy type.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces consummate liar and alters mesmerist tricks.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Painful Stare (Su): </b>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>
			<p><b>Towering Ego (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a mesmerist gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 0) on Will saving throws. If the mesmerist is under any effect that would prevent him from providing the emotional component of psychic spells (see page 144), he loses this bonus on saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Bold Stare (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can&#146;t be changed later. The mesmerist can&#146;t choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist&#146;s bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Insidious Hatred (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a hate-monger can sow hatred and strife under the pretense of assisting others. He can use his touch treatment only on others, but as part of the action of using touch treatment, he can cast any targeted spell from the mental manipulator list that does not have a range of &#147;personal&#148; and has a casting time of 1 standard action or less, targeting only the creature that receives his touch treatment. That creature doesn&#146;t realize the hatemonger has cast a spell, and considers any manifestations to be part of the touch treatment. Other creatures notice as normal. The target creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on its saving throw and to its spell resistance against the spell.</p>
			<p>This ability alters touch treatment.</p>
			<p><b>Touch Treatment (Su): </b>At 3rd level, the mesmerist can help allies shake off harmful conditions&#151;especially those that affect their minds&#151;by channeling psychic energy through his healing hands. He can use touch treatment a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the mesmerist uses it on himself ), and the mesmerist must be able to touch his target. He can remove one condition from one target each time he uses this ability. At 3rd level, he can remove any condition on the minor conditions list. At 6th level, he can remove any condition on the minor or moderate conditions list, and at 10th level, he can remove any condition on the minor, moderate, or greater conditions list.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Minor Conditions: </i>Fascinated, shaken.</li>
				<li><i>Moderate Conditions: </i>Confused, dazed, frightened, sickened.</li>
				<li><i>Greater Conditions: </i>Cowering, nauseated, panicked, stunned.</li>
			</list>
			<p>A 14th level, the mesmerist can instead expend one use of touch treatment to replicate the effects of break enchantment. This targets only one creature the mesmerist is touching and follows all other restrictions of touch treatment.</p>
			<p><b>Xenophobe (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a hate-monger can choose one favored enemy, as per the ranger class feature. His favored enemy bonus begins at +2 and increases by 2 for every 4 mesmerist levels after 5th, but he does not gain additional favored enemies. His favored enemy bonus also applies on Intimidate checks against his favored enemy.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces mental potency and manifold tricks.</p>
			<p><b>Out for Blood (Ex): </b>At 7th level, when a creature takes extra damage from the hate-monger&#146;s painful stare, it also takes 1 point of bleed damage (or 1 point of bleed damage per 1d6 points of damage dealt by the painful stare if the hatemonger damages the target himself ). This bleed damage does not stack with itself or other sources of bleed damage.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the 7th-level bold stare.</p>
			<p><b>Insidious Emotions (Su): </b>At 11th level, the power of a hatemonger&#146;s psychic hold becomes more difficult to detect or to break. The DC of Sense Motive checks to notice if a creature is under the effects of his enchantments with the emotionUM descriptor increases by 5 (if he also has the Subtle EnchantmentUI feat, the effects stack), as does the DC to identify his emotion spells. Magical divinations can detect his emotion effects only if the caster succeeds at a caster level check (DC = 11 + the hate-monger&#146;s mesmerist level) as if the affected creatures were the subject of nondetection.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces glib lie.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>Rule Minds (Su): </b>At 20th level, a mesmerist can permanently mentally enslave a creature. When the mesmerist successfully affects the target of his hypnotic stare with an enchantment spell that requires a saving throw, he can force that creature to attempt a second Will saving throw with a DC equal to the spell&#146;s DC. The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn&#146;t a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can&#146;t be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.</p>

					<p>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1).

This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 3rd level, as a standard action, a gaslighter can implant a maddening phantasm in the mind of the target of his hypnotic stare, causing the target to perceive its own reflection as corrupted in some disturbing way. This is a mind-affecting fear effect, and there is no saving throw. The target is simultaneously captivated and horrified by the sight of its own reflection, and in any round in which the target can see itself in a mirror within 30 feet, the gaslighter can trigger his painful stare against the target without dealing damage. This is a gaze attack, and the creature can avert its eyes to attempt to avoid it. Any creature holding a visible mirror that attempts to demoralize the target can choose to add the gaslighter&#146;s Charisma modifier to its Intimidate check instead of its own. Horrid mask lasts until that particular hypnotic stare ends (often when the target moves away from a mirror). The gaslighter can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>This ability replaces touch treatment (minor) and alters painful stare.</p>

					<p>At 6th level, a gaslighter can force the target of his horrid mask ability to recoil from its reflection. Whenever the gaslighter uses horrid mask, if an affected target begins its turn adjacent to a mirror, it must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the gaslighter&#146;s mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier) or be compelled to either flee from the mirror (or the creature holding it) to beyond 30 feet or attempt to destroy the mirror (or the creature holding it). This is a gaze attack, and the target can attempt to avert its eyes.</p>

The gaslighter can use either this ability or horrid mask during a particular hypnotic stare, but not both at once. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A gaslighter takes joy in others&#146; suffering, delighting in driving them to madness.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>A gaslighter must be of an evil alignment. A gaslighter who becomes nonevil cannot gain new levels as a mesmerist but retains all his class abilities.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Mesmerist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Consummate Cruelty: </b>A gaslighter gains a bonus equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) on Intimidate checks. A gaslighter can take Improved Dirty TrickAPG and Greater Dirty TrickAPG without having Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of 13. He can also ignore those two prerequisites for other feats that have Improved Dirty Trick or Greater Dirty Trick as a prerequisite.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces consummate liar.</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su): </b>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Painful Stare (Su): </b>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>
			<p><b>Towering Ego (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a mesmerist gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 0) on Will saving throws. If the mesmerist is under any effect that would prevent him from providing the emotional component of psychic spells (see page 144), he loses this bonus on saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Bold Stare (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can&#146;t be changed later. The mesmerist can&#146;t choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist&#146;s bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Horrid Mask (Su): </b>At 3rd level, as a standard action, a gaslighter can implant a maddening phantasm in the mind of the target of his hypnotic stare, causing the target to perceive its own reflection as corrupted in some disturbing way. This is a mind-affecting fear effect, and there is no saving throw. The target is simultaneously captivated and horrified by the sight of its own reflection, and in any round in which the target can see itself in a mirror within 30 feet, the gaslighter can trigger his painful stare against the target without dealing damage. This is a gaze attack, and the creature can avert its eyes to attempt to avoid it. Any creature holding a visible mirror that attempts to demoralize the target can choose to add the gaslighter&#146;s Charisma modifier to its Intimidate check instead of its own. Horrid mask lasts until that particular hypnotic stare ends (often when the target moves away from a mirror). The gaslighter can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces touch treatment (minor) and alters painful stare.</p>
			<p><b>Manifold Tricks (Su): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can have two tricks implanted at a time. The number of concurrent tricks increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he possesses beyond 5th. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist&#146;s tricks).</p>
			<p><b>Mental Potency (Ex): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment or illusion spell he casts increase by 1. For enchantment and illusion spells he casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be). For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>
			<p><b>Phantasmal Force (Su): </b>At 6th level, a gaslighter can force the target of his horrid mask ability to recoil from its reflection. Whenever the gaslighter uses horrid mask, if an affected target begins its turn adjacent to a mirror, it must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the gaslighter&#146;s mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier) or be compelled to either flee from the mirror (or the creature holding it) to beyond 30 feet or attempt to destroy the mirror (or the creature holding it). This is a gaze attack, and the target can attempt to avert its eyes.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces touch treatment (moderate).</p>
			<p><b>Phantasmal Foes (Su): </b>At 10th level, a gaslighter can spend one use of his horrid mask ability as a standard action to convince the target of his hypnotic stare that it is surrounded by foes only it can see. The target is treated as flanked for any melee attacks against it until the hypnotic stare ends. The gaslighter can use either this ability or horrid mask during a particular hypnotic stare, but not both at once. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces touch treatment (greater).</p>
			<p><b>Glib Lie (Su): </b>At 11th level, a mesmerist can deceive truthdetecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the mesmerist&#146;s class level to succeed (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn&#146;t detect the mesmerist&#146;s lies or force him to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the mesmerist the glibness spell&#146;s bonus on Bluff checks.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>Corosion of Sanity (Su): </b>At 14th level, whenever a creature fails its initial saving throw against a gaslighter&#146;s singletarget mind-affecting effect, the target also takes 1 point of Wisdom damage. This has no effect on abilities that don&#146;t allow a saving throw or affect multiple targets or an area. If using the sanity system (see page 12), the target takes 2 points of sanity damage instead.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces touch treatment (break enchantment).</p>
			<p><b>Rule Minds (Su): </b>At 20th level, a mesmerist can permanently mentally enslave a creature. When the mesmerist successfully affects the target of his hypnotic stare with an enchantment spell that requires a saving throw, he can force that creature to attempt a second Will saving throw with a DC equal to the spell&#146;s DC. The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn&#146;t a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can&#146;t be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist adds 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Bluff checks. In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesn&#146;t have Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of at least 13. He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater Feint.</p>

				<name type="string">Hypnotic Stare</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>

Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
					<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
					<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>

The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
					<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>

				<name type="string">Painful Stare</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>

				<name type="string">Fey Veil</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 3rd level, a fey trickster&#146;s physical form begins to shift, as she gains some of the impossible allure of the fey. At the same time, she begins able to use fey veils to assist herself and her allies in befuddling and bewitching their opponents. She can use her fey veils a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the fey trickster calls up a veil over herself ). If she targets another ally, the fey trickster must be able to contact the ally bodily, usually with a kiss. When she uses her fey veil, the fey trickster subtly alters the appearance and aura of her target, granting one of the powers allowed by her mesmerist level. t 3rd level, she can grant the ally a +2 circumstance bonus on her choice of Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Handle Animal checks for 1 minute. At 6th level, she can change the ally&#146;s form so thoroughly that the ally gains a +10 bonus on Disguise checks until the next sunrise (similar to the bonus from disguise self, but it also disguises touch and sound, and it doesn&#146;t allow a saving throw to disbelieve).</p>
					<p>At 10th level, the fey trickster can make the ally and her aura so attractive or repulsive for 10 minutes that the veil automatically adjusts the moods of those who see the ally and fail their saving throw, as telempathic projectionOA. At 14th level, a fey trickster can create a veil so powerful that it fools even reality, granting the full effects of both the 6th-level fey veil and alter self to the target for 1 hour. Each of these abilities, even the 14th-level ability, is an illusion and glamer effect, though the last ability counts as a size-changing polymorph effect for the limit of only one polymorph or size-changing effect on a creature.</p>
					<p>This ability replaces touch treatment.</p>

For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Most mesmerists draw psychic power from the Astral Plane, but a few gain their powers in an unusual way: from a brush with the fey. Prisoner-guests of the fey, these souls find themselves changed when they return to the mortal world, infused with the eldritch energy of their former hosts.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Mesmerist's class skills are Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Consummate Liar: </b>A mesmerist adds 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Bluff checks. In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesn&#146;t have Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of at least 13. He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater Feint.</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su): </b>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Nature&#146;s Lure: </b>Rather than casting psychic spells from the mesmerist spell list, a fey trickster casts divine spells drawn from the druid and ranger spell lists, in just the same way as a hunter does. This means that she gains orisons instead of knacks. This doesn&#146;t change her number of spells per day or spells known. The fey trickster&#146;s mesmerist spells and spell-like abilities count as if they were fey spell-like abilities for the purpose of effects like resist nature&#146;s lure that apply against fey spell-like abilities.</p>
			<p>This alters the mesmerist&#146;s spellcasting.</p>
			<p><b>Painful Stare (Su): </b>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>
			<p><b>Feytouched (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a fey trickster&#146;s time with the fey has granted her strange powers, as well as resistance to further fey mischief. The fey trickster gains the druid&#146;s resist nature&#146;s lure and woodland stride abilities, and she counts as both fey and her original creature type for the purpose of spells and effects.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces towering ego.</p>
			<p><b>Bold Stare (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can&#146;t be changed later. The mesmerist can&#146;t choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist&#146;s bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Fey Veil (Sp, Su): </b>At 3rd level, a fey trickster&#146;s physical form begins to shift, as she gains some of the impossible allure of the fey. At the same time, she begins able to use fey veils to assist herself and her allies in befuddling and bewitching their opponents. She can use her fey veils a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the fey trickster calls up a veil over herself ). If she targets another ally, the fey trickster must be able to contact the ally bodily, usually with a kiss. When she uses her fey veil, the fey trickster subtly alters the appearance and aura of her target, granting one of the powers allowed by her mesmerist level. t 3rd level, she can grant the ally a +2 circumstance bonus on her choice of Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Handle Animal checks for 1 minute. At 6th level, she can change the ally&#146;s form so thoroughly that the ally gains a +10 bonus on Disguise checks until the next sunrise (similar to the bonus from disguise self, but it also disguises touch and sound, and it doesn&#146;t allow a saving throw to disbelieve).</p>
			<p>At 10th level, the fey trickster can make the ally and her aura so attractive or repulsive for 10 minutes that the veil automatically adjusts the moods of those who see the ally and fail their saving throw, as telempathic projectionOA. At 14th level, a fey trickster can create a veil so powerful that it fools even reality, granting the full effects of both the 6th-level fey veil and alter self to the target for 1 hour. Each of these abilities, even the 14th-level ability, is an illusion and glamer effect, though the last ability counts as a size-changing polymorph effect for the limit of only one polymorph or size-changing effect on a creature.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces touch treatment.</p>
			<p><b>Manifold Tricks (Su): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can have two tricks implanted at a time. The number of concurrent tricks increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he possesses beyond 5th. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist&#146;s tricks).</p>
			<p><b>Mental Potency (Ex): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment or illusion spell he casts increase by 1. For enchantment and illusion spells he casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be). For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>
			<p><b>Glib Lie (Su): </b>At 11th level, a mesmerist can deceive truthdetecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the mesmerist&#146;s class level to succeed (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn&#146;t detect the mesmerist&#146;s lies or force him to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the mesmerist the glibness spell&#146;s bonus on Bluff checks.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>One with the Fey: </b>At 20th level, a fey trickster fully transforms into a fey, though she can still choose to count as her original creature type as well whenever it would be advantageous to her (such as if she is a humanoid and wishes to be affected by reduce person). She gains low-light vision as well as an additional ability depending on which type of fey she chooses to most closely associate with. Some examples follow.</p>
			<p>Erlking: The fey trickster is constantly under the effects of haste.</p>
			<p>Nymph: The fey trickster gains the nymph&#146;s unearthly grace ability (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 217)</p>
			<p>Quickling: The fey trickster gains the quickling&#146;s supernatural speed ability (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 227).</p>
			<p>Rusalka: The fey trickster gains the rusalka&#146;s tresses ability and four tress primary natural attacks similar to those of a rusalka (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 232).</p>
			<p>This ability replaces rule minds.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>

					<p>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Mesmerists focus their abilities through the eyes, drawing forth their power as the windows to the mind and soul. Eyebiters take this a step further. An eyebiter&#146;s eyes become so infused with psychic might that they can leave the eyebiter&#146;s body and move about on their own.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Mesmerist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Eyeball Familiar (Ex): </b>An eyebiter imbues one of his eyes with limited sentience, so that he can pluck it out and allow it to move on its own. The eyeball familiar functions similarly to the tumor familiar alchemist discovery (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 17) except as follows. The eyeball familiar does not have fast healing. The eyeball familiar doesn&#146;t resemble an animal, and its size is Fine for a Medium or smaller eyebiter (or one size category larger for every size category the eyebiter is larger than Medium). It has a fly speed of 20 feet (perfect maneuverability) and no physical attacks (though it can still deliver touch spells once the eyebiter has reached 3rd level). The eyeball has a Strength score of 1, a Dexterity score of 12, and a Constitution score of 10. It has no set Hit Die, base saves, or skill ranks of its own, though it uses its master&#146;s when a familiar normally would. It doesn&#146;t grant its master any familiar bonus, nor can it ever be an improved familiar.</p>
			<p>Whenever the eyebiter&#146;s eyeball familiar leaves his body, he is dazzled until it returns (if it is destroyed, the eyebiter loses that eye until he gains the effects of a regeneration). An eyebiter must have at least one eye to use this ability, and an eyebiter with only one eye is blinded instead of dazzled until his familiar returns.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces consummate liar and the mesmerist trick gained at 1st level.</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su): </b>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Painful Stare (Su): </b>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 2nd level, and learns another trick at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Towering Ego (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a mesmerist gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 0) on Will saving throws. If the mesmerist is under any effect that would prevent him from providing the emotional component of psychic spells (see page 144), he loses this bonus on saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Bold Stare (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can&#146;t be changed later. The mesmerist can&#146;t choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist&#146;s bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Ocular Occlusion (Su): </b>At 3rd level, an eyebiter gains the ability to cloud the sight of others with a melee touch attack. He can use this ability as a standard action a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. A successful Will save negates the effect (DC = 10 + 1/2 the eyebiter&#146;s mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier); this is a mind-affecting ability. If the eyebiter chooses to use an ocular occlusion of a lower level than the highest-level effect he has gained, he can instead use a standard action to target a creature within 30 feet with that effect as a ranged touch attack.</p>
			<p><i>Clouded Vision: </i>At 3rd level, the eyebiter can cause the target to become dazzled for 1 minute and suffer a 20% miss chance on all attacks the target makes against opponents within 60 feet. Opponents more than 60 feet away have total concealment from the target.</p>
			<p><i>Cause or Cure Blindness: </i>At 6th level, the eyebiter can blind the target for 1 minute or affect it as per the spells remove blindness.</p>
			<p><i>Eyeless Horror: </i>At 10th level, the eyebiter creates a powerful illusion that causes the target&#146;s eyes to appear as if they have been ripped out, with blood pouring from the sockets. The target is blinded and shaken for 1 round per the eyebiter&#146;s mesmerist level, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage each round. The target can attempt a second Will save when attacked to negate the shaken effect and the nonlethal damage.</p>
			<p><i>Spellblight: </i>At 14th level, the eyebiter can afflict the target with the ebon eyes, the eldritch cataracts, or the hemoculysis spellblight (Ultimate Magic 95).</p>
			<p>This ability replaces all instances of touch treatment.</p>
			<p><b>Manifold Tricks (Su): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can have two tricks implanted at a time. The number of concurrent tricks increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he possesses beyond 5th. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist&#146;s tricks).</p>
			<p><b>Staring Eye (Su): </b>At 5th level, an eyebiter can expend one use of his daily mesmerist tricks to either see through his eyeball familiar as if it were an arcane eye, or to use his hypnotic stare (including related abilities like painful stare and bold stare), as well as any gaze attack he possesses (like burning gaze and eyebite) through his eyeball familiar, as if he were at its location.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces mental potency.</p>
			<p><b>Omnivisual (Ex): </b>At 11th level, an eyebiter&#146;s roving eyeball familiar is constantly watching in all directions. As long as his eyeball familiar is outside his body and near enough to see the same things (such as being in the same room), the eyebiter gains all-around vision (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 294) and cannot be flanked.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces glib lie.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>Rule Minds (Su): </b>At 20th level, a mesmerist can permanently mentally enslave a creature. When the mesmerist successfully affects the target of his hypnotic stare with an enchantment spell that requires a saving throw, he can force that creature to attempt a second Will saving throw with a DC equal to the spell&#146;s DC. The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn&#146;t a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can&#146;t be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level, the mesmerist can help allies shake off harmful conditions&#151;especially those that affect their minds&#151;by channeling psychic energy through his healing hands. He can use touch treatment a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the mesmerist uses it on himself ), and the mesmerist must be able to touch his target. He can remove one condition from one target each time he uses this ability. At 3rd level, he can remove any condition on the minor conditions list. At 6th level, he can remove any condition on the minor or moderate conditions list, and at 10th level, he can remove any condition on the minor, moderate, or greater conditions list.</p>
					<p><i>Minor Conditions: </i>Fascinated, shaken.</p>
					<p><i>Moderate Conditions: </i>Confused, dazed, frightened, sickened.</p>
					<p><i>Greater Conditions: </i>Cowering, nauseated, panicked, stunned.</p>
					<p>A 14th level, the mesmerist can instead expend one use of touch treatment to replicate the effects of break enchantment. This targets only one creature the mesmerist is touching and follows all other restrictions of touch treatment.</p>

					<p>At 1st level, whenever the enigma uses hypnotic stare on a creature, instead of applying a penalty on the creature&#146;s saving throws, the enigma begins to fade from the creature&#146;s view. Until the enigma&#146;s next turn, the enigma gains the effects of concealment against that creature (unless it can see invisible creatures). Starting on the enigma&#146;s next turn, he gains the effect of invisibility against that creature. These effects last as long as the enigma continues to use his hypnotic stare, but if he takes an action that would end invisibility, it ends his hypnotic stare immediately. The enigma can reinstate this effect whenever he wishes, but each time it begins with 1 round of concealment. At 8th level, attacks that would end invisibility do not end the enigma&#146;s hypnotic stare, and after 1 round of concealment, he gains the benef its of greater invisibility against the target of his stare. For the purpose of bold stare improvements, the enigma&#146;s hypnotic stare always has a penalty of &#150;1.</p>

					<p>At 5th level, the mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment or illusion spell he casts increase by 1. For enchantment and illusion spells he casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be). For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>An enigma spends his life dedicated to developing psychic abilities that allow him to operate unnoticed. While the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare might not realize that the mesmerist is the source of the strange thoughts invading his mind, an enigma takes that mental obfuscation to a more extreme level. Enigmas often end up serving as master spies and infiltration experts.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Mesmerist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Enigmatic Stare (Su): </b>The target of an enigma&#146;s hypnotic stare takes a &#150;4 penalty on Perception checks to notice the enigma. At 8th level, this penalty increases to &#150; 6.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces painful stare.</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su): </b>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Solipsism (Su) </b>: At 1st level, whenever the enigma uses hypnotic stare on a creature, instead of applying a penalty on the creature&#146;s saving throws, the enigma begins to fade from the creature&#146;s view. Until the enigma&#146;s next turn, the enigma gains the effects of concealment against that creature (unless it can see invisible creatures). Starting on the enigma&#146;s next turn, he gains the effect of invisibility against that creature. These effects last as long as the enigma continues to use his hypnotic stare, but if he takes an action that would end invisibility, it ends his hypnotic stare immediately. The enigma can reinstate this effect whenever he wishes, but each time it begins with 1 round of concealment. At 8th level, attacks that would end invisibility do not end the enigma&#146;s hypnotic stare, and after 1 round of concealment, he gains the benef its of greater invisibility against the target of his stare. For the purpose of bold stare improvements, the enigma&#146;s hypnotic stare always has a penalty of &#150;1.</p>
			<p>This ability alters hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Veiled Steps: </b>An enigma gains a bonus to his Stealth checks equal to 1/4 his mesmerist level (minimum +1).</p>
			<p>This ability replaces consummate liar.</p>
			<p><b>Towering Ego (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a mesmerist gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 0) on Will saving throws. If the mesmerist is under any effect that would prevent him from providing the emotional component of psychic spells (see page 144), he loses this bonus on saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Bold Stare (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can&#146;t be changed later. The mesmerist can&#146;t choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist&#146;s bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Touch Treatment (Su): </b>At 3rd level, the mesmerist can help allies shake off harmful conditions&#151;especially those that affect their minds&#151;by channeling psychic energy through his healing hands. He can use touch treatment a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the mesmerist uses it on himself ), and the mesmerist must be able to touch his target. He can remove one condition from one target each time he uses this ability. At 3rd level, he can remove any condition on the minor conditions list. At 6th level, he can remove any condition on the minor or moderate conditions list, and at 10th level, he can remove any condition on the minor, moderate, or greater conditions list.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Minor Conditions: </i>Fascinated, shaken.</li>
				<li><i>Moderate Conditions: </i>Confused, dazed, frightened, sickened.</li>
				<li><i>Greater Conditions: </i>Cowering, nauseated, panicked, stunned.</li>
			</list>
			<p>A 14th level, the mesmerist can instead expend one use of touch treatment to replicate the effects of break enchantment. This targets only one creature the mesmerist is touching and follows all other restrictions of touch treatment.</p>
			<p><b>Transfer Affliction (Su): </b>At 3rd level, the enigma can afflict others with the harmful conditions that he endures. This ability functions as the touch treatment ability, but can only be used to remove harmful conditions from the enigma, not other creatures. In order to remove these harmful effects, the enigma must succeed at a touch attack against another creature. The creature touched gains the chosen harmful effect for whatever duration it would have afflicted the enigma and the effect is removed from the enigma, unless the creature succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the enigma&#146;s mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier). Using this ability is always a standard action. At 14th level, the enigma can instead expend one use of touch treatment to replicate the effects of bestow curse, delivered as a touch attack as part of using this ability. Transfer affliction is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p>This ability alters touch treatment.</p>
			<p><b>Mental Potency (Ex): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment or illusion spell he casts increase by 1. For enchantment and illusion spells he casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be). For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack (Ex): </b>At 5th level, an enigma gains the sneak attack ability of a rogue. This sneak attack damage is +1d6 at 5th level, and increases by +1d6 every 4 mesmerist levels thereafter.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces manifold tricks.</p>
			<p><b>Detection Void (Su): </b>At 11th level, an enigma can elude detection spells (spells with &#147;detect&#148; in their name). A creature using this sort of magic against the enigma must succeed at a caster level check against a DC equal to 15 + the enigma&#146;s class level to succeed (as if the enigma was under the effect of a nondetection spell); failure means the magic fails to detect the enigma, as if he did not exist.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces glib lie.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>Absentia (Su): </b>At 20th level, all creatures adjacent to the enigma subconsciously ignore him. Adjacent creatures are always treated as flat-footed to the enigma and are not considered to be directly observing the enigma for the purpose of the Stealth skill. This effect ends immediately if the enigma makes a successful attack against any creature, but automatically resumes at the beginning of his next turn.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces rule minds.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>

In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesn&#146;t have Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of at least 13. He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater Feint.</p>

				<name type="string">Hypnotic Stare</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
					<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
					<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 2nd level, and learns another trick at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>

The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
					<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 2nd level, and learns another trick at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>

				<name type="string">Painful Stare</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Many mesmerists concentrate their studies on conscious, rational thought, but dreamstalkers instead delve into the unleashed unconscious mind that wanders free in dreams.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Mesmerist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Consummate Liar: </b>A mesmerist adds 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Bluff checks. In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesn&#146;t have Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of at least 13. He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater Feint.</p>
			<p><b>Dreams of Pain: </b>A dreamstalker&#146;s painful stare deals nonlethal damage. This ability alters painful stare.</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su): </b>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Painful Stare (Su): </b>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>
			<p><b>Somnomancer: </b>At 1st level, a dreamstalker gains the slumberAPG hex. The dreamstalker&#146;s effective witch level is equal to her mesmerist level, and she can activate them only by expending two daily uses of mesmerist tricks. The save DCs for her hexes are Charisma-based. She can take certain additional hexes in place of mesmerist tricks, selecting nightmaresAPG or visionAPG at 10th level and higher, or eternal slumberAPG at 18th level and higher.</p>
			<p>When she would normally gain a new mesmerist trick, she can learn additional spells instead. Each time she does so, she adds two of the following spells of a level she can currently cast to her list of spells known: 1st&#151;oneiric horrorOA, sleep; 2nd&#151;detect mindscapeOA, greater oneiric horrorOA, instigate psychic duelOA; 3rd&#151;deep slumber, minor dreamOA; 4th&#151;create mindscapeOA, dream, forgetful slumberARG, mindscape doorOA, sleepwalkARG, sleepwalking suggestion (see page 127); 5th&#151;cloak of dreams, dream councilOA, dream scanOA, symbol of sleep, waves of fatigue; 6th&#151;dream travelOA, greater create mindscapeOA, waves of exhaustion.</p>
			<p>This alters mesmerist tricks and replaces the 1st-level mesmerist trick.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 2nd level, and learns another trick at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Sleepless (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a dreamstalker gains immunity to sleep effects and a bonus equal to her Charisma bonus on saving throws against fatigue and exhaustion. She loses both benefits when under an effect that would prevent her from providing an emotion component (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 144).</p>
			<p>This replaces towering ego.</p>
			<p><b>Bold Stare (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can&#146;t be changed later. The mesmerist can&#146;t choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist&#146;s bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Touch of Night (Su): </b>A dreamstalker can&#146;t remove shaken, frightened, sickened, cowering, nauseated, or panicked conditions using her touch treatment. However, she can remove fatigue or magical sleep (other than hard-to-remove magical sleep such as the eternal slumberAPG hex) as a minor condition, staggered as a moderate condition, and exhausted as a greater condition. As normal, removing fatigue or exhaustion only removes the condition, not the underlying cause, such as lack of sleep.</p>
			<p>This ability alters touch treatment.</p>
			<p><b>Touch Treatment (Su): </b>At 3rd level, the mesmerist can help allies shake off harmful conditions&#151;especially those that affect their minds&#151;by channeling psychic energy through his healing hands. He can use touch treatment a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the mesmerist uses it on himself ), and the mesmerist must be able to touch his target. He can remove one condition from one target each time he uses this ability. At 3rd level, he can remove any condition on the minor conditions list. At 6th level, he can remove any condition on the minor or moderate conditions list, and at 10th level, he can remove any condition on the minor, moderate, or greater conditions list.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Minor Conditions: </i>Fascinated, shaken.</li>
				<li><i>Moderate Conditions: </i>Confused, dazed, frightened, sickened.</li>
				<li><i>Greater Conditions: </i>Cowering, nauseated, panicked, stunned.</li>
			</list>
			<p>A 14th level, the mesmerist can instead expend one use of touch treatment to replicate the effects of break enchantment. This targets only one creature the mesmerist is touching and follows all other restrictions of touch treatment.</p>
			<p><b>Dreamwalker (Su): </b>At 5th level, a dreamstalker treats dreamscapes as a favored terrain, as per the ranger ability, gaining a +2 bonus that increases by 2 every 4 mesmerist levels after 5th. While in a dreamscape, she also treats any creature from the Dimension of Dreams (including dreamed figments) as her favored enemy, with a bonus equal to 1/2 her favored terrain bonus.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces manifold tricks.</p>
			<p><b>Mental Potency (Ex): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment or illusion spell he casts increase by 1. For enchantment and illusion spells he casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be). For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>
			<p><b>Tramautic Spell: </b>At 11th level, a dreamstalker gains Traumatic SpellOA as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces glib lie.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>Rule Minds (Su): </b>At 20th level, a mesmerist can permanently mentally enslave a creature. When the mesmerist successfully affects the target of his hypnotic stare with an enchantment spell that requires a saving throw, he can force that creature to attempt a second Will saving throw with a DC equal to the spell&#146;s DC. The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn&#146;t a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can&#146;t be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
					<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
					<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, a cult master can turn his gaze on a creature to fill it with fervent belief in the cult master. The target of the gaze gains a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls. This bonus increases by 1 for every 6 mesmerist levels the cult master possesses, to a maximum of +4 at 18th level. Instead of taking the hypnotic stare&#146;s penalty on Will saves, the target gains a bonus of an equal amount on Will saves. The bonuses don&#146;t apply to attacks against the cult master or on saves against the cult master&#146;s spells or abilities. The cult master can also suppress any penalties inflicted by his stare for the target. This ability replaces painful stare.</p>

					<p>Double: An illusion makes either the cult master&#146;s cohort or one of his followers appear to be him. The cult master can trigger this trick when he is targeted by an attack, provided he is adjacent to the subject, to give the attack a 50% miss chance. If the attack misses the cult master, it targets the subject instead. This is an illusion (glamer) effect.</p>
					<p>Extol: A mental compulsion causes a cohort or follower to extol the virtues of the cult master. The cult master can trigger this trick whenever he attempts a Diplomacy check, as long as he is within 60 feet of the subject. The subject takes the aid another action on the cult master&#146;s Diplomacy check. If the subject is successful, the cult master gains a +4 bonus on his check. This is an enchantment (compulsion) effect.</p>

					<p>At 5th level, the mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment or illusion spell he casts increase by 1. For enchantment and illusion spells he casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be). For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>

Whenever the cult master takes hit point damage from an attack, he can trigger this trick as long as he is within 60 feet of the subject. The subject is immediately affected as if by the rage spell for 1 round per mesmerist level.</p>
					<p>Die for Me: The cult master instills within either his cohort or one of his followers the desire to give her life for him. The cult master can trigger this trick whenever he would take hit point damage from an attack, spell, or effect and the subject is with 60 feet of him. Half the damage is psychically transferred to the subject. This is an enchantment (compulsion) effect.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The leaders of some cults are simply charlatans, bathing in the adulation of their followers. Others believe themselves to be truly in touch with an unknown power, bringing their unique messages to those willing to follow and obey them.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Mesmerist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Cult Tricks (Su): </b>The following new tricks can be selected by a cult master. These tricks can be implanted only in a cohort or follower of the cult master.</p>
			<p><i>Double: </i>An illusion makes either the cult master&#146;s cohort or one of his followers appear to be him. The cult master can trigger this trick when he is targeted by an attack, provided he is adjacent to the subject, to give the attack a 50% miss chance. If the attack misses the cult master, it targets the subject instead. This is an illusion (glamer) effect.</p>
			<p><i>Extol: </i>A mental compulsion causes a cohort or follower to extol the virtues of the cult master. The cult master can trigger this trick whenever he attempts a Diplomacy check, as long as he is within 60 feet of the subject. The subject takes the aid another action on the cult master&#146;s Diplomacy check. If the subject is successful, the cult master gains a +4 bonus on his check. This is an enchantment (compulsion) effect.</p>
			<p>This ability alters mesmerist tricks.</p>
			<p><b>Fanatical Stare (Su): </b>At 1st level, a cult master can turn his gaze on a creature to fill it with fervent belief in the cult master. The target of the gaze gains a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls. This bonus increases by 1 for every 6 mesmerist levels the cult master possesses, to a maximum of +4 at 18th level. Instead of taking the hypnotic stare&#146;s penalty on Will saves, the target gains a bonus of an equal amount on Will saves. The bonuses don&#146;t apply to attacks against the cult master or on saves against the cult master&#146;s spells or abilities. The cult master can also suppress any penalties inflicted by his stare for the target. This ability replaces painful stare.</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su): </b>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Insidious Personality (Ex): </b>A cult master adds 1/2 his class level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Diplomacy checks. This ability replaces consummate liar.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Towering Ego (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a mesmerist gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 0) on Will saving throws. If the mesmerist is under any effect that would prevent him from providing the emotional component of psychic spells (see page 144), he loses this bonus on saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Bold Stare (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can&#146;t be changed later. The mesmerist can&#146;t choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist&#146;s bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>False Healing (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a cult master can provide temporary healing by using his psychic powers to trick the mind a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the cult master uses it on himself ), and the cult master must be able to touch his target. The cult master grants a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + his Charisma modifier to the target. At 6th level, the cult master can either grant a number of temporary hit points equal to 2d8 + his Charisma modifier to the target or temporarily remove 1d4 points of ability damage. A creature can receive the effect of the false healing only once per day. The temporary hit points or reduction in ability damage lasts a number of hours equal to the cult master&#146;s class level. This ability replaces the 3rd- and 6th-level touch treatments.</p>
			<p><b>Manifold Tricks (Su): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can have two tricks implanted at a time. The number of concurrent tricks increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he possesses beyond 5th. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist&#146;s tricks).</p>
			<p><b>Mental Potency (Ex): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment or illusion spell he casts increase by 1. For enchantment and illusion spells he casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be). For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>
			<p><b>Faithful Followers (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a cult master begins to attract followers to his espoused beliefs, thanks to his magnetic personality. The cult master gains Leadership as a bonus feat. This ability replaces the 7th-level bold stare.</p>
			<p><b>Fanatical Devotion (Ex): </b>At 10th level, a cult master has manipulated his cohort and followers into becoming utterly devoted to him. The cult master no longer takes a penalty to his Leadership score for being aloof or cruel. Additionally, the DCs of all enchantment spells the cult master casts on his cohort and followers increase by 4. At 14th level, the cult master no longer takes a penalty to his Leadership score for any cohorts or followers he has killed or caused to be killed. This ability replaces the 10th- and 14th-level touch treatments.</p>
			<p><b>Glib Lie (Su): </b>At 11th level, a mesmerist can deceive truthdetecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the mesmerist&#146;s class level to succeed (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn&#146;t detect the mesmerist&#146;s lies or force him to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the mesmerist the glibness spell&#146;s bonus on Bluff checks.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Cult Tricks (Su): </b>The following new master tricks can be selected by any cult master of 12th level or higher. These tricks can be implanted only in a cohort or follower of the cult master.</p>
			<p><i>Avenge Me: </i>The cult master creates a compulsion for one of his followers to avenge him. Whenever the cult master takes hit point damage from an attack, he can trigger this trick as long as he is within 60 feet of the subject. The subject is immediately affected as if by the rage spell for 1 round per mesmerist level.</p>
			<p><i>Die for Me: </i>The cult master instills within either his cohort or one of his followers the desire to give her life for him. The cult master can trigger this trick whenever he would take hit point damage from an attack, spell, or effect and the subject is with 60 feet of him. Half the damage is psychically transferred to the subject. This is an enchantment (compulsion) effect.</p>
			<p>This ability alters masterful tricks.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>Reborn (Su): </b>At 20th level, a cult master can ensure his own survival upon his death. The cult master can perform a 1-hour ceremony costing 5,000 gp in rare materials in which he uses his psychic powers to implant a small portion of his essence into his cohort, who must be a minimum of 17th level. When the cult master dies, in 7 days the cohort physically and mentally transforms into the cult master as if clone had been cast, except that the cohort&#146;s body takes the place of the inert body. The cult master can&#146;t use this ability again until he gains a new cohort of at least 17th level and performs the necessary ceremony. The cohort can&#146;t be brought back to life except through miracle or wish. This ability replaces rule minds.</p>

				<name type="string">Hypnotic Stare</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>

					<p>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
					<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
					<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>

				<name type="string">Painful Stare</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level, as an immediate action, a chart caster can grant an ally a +1 competence bonus on a failed attack roll, saving throw, or skill check by reminding his ally of their destined success. The chart caster must use his ability within 1 round of the failed check, and his ally must be within 30 feet of him when he does. If the bonus is enough to turn the failure into a success, the ally succeeds at the check. At 6th level, the bonus increases to +2. At 10th level, it increases to +5. A chart caster can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his Charisma modifier.</p>

					<p>A chart caster cannot implant tricks as a standard action. Instead, he can spend 5 minutes to implant multiple tricks in a single willing target.

					<p>If implanting tricks in himself, the caster merely spends 5 minutes in contemplation; otherwise, he consults star charts while ritually asking the creature questions, and still must touch them to do so. At 1st level, he can select multiple instances of the same trick to implant in a single subject. At 5th level, a chart caster can implant two different subjects with multiple instances of one trick each and can choose a different trick for each subject. The number of additional subjects increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he has beyond 5th.</p>

					<p>At 5th level, the mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment or illusion spell he casts increase by 1.

For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>

The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn&#146;t a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can&#146;t be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Lirgeni astrologists would divine their futures by consulting star charts, but some had no talent for astrology and simply faked their results. When prophecy died with Aroden, a few Lirgeni survivors continued with this &#147;reliable&#148; method.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Mesmerist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Consummate Liar: </b>A mesmerist adds 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Bluff checks. In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesn&#146;t have Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of at least 13. He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater Feint.</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su): </b>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Painful Stare (Su): </b>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>
			<p><b>Subject of the Stars (Su): </b>A chart caster cannot implant tricks as a standard action. Instead, he can spend 5 minutes to implant multiple tricks in a single willing target. The number of tricks he can implant per day is unchanged from the regular mesmerist class, but he can apply as many of those tricks as he chooses on a single use of this ability.</p>
			<p>If implanting tricks in himself, the caster merely spends 5 minutes in contemplation; otherwise, he consults star charts while ritually asking the creature questions, and still must touch them to do so. At 1st level, he can select multiple instances of the same trick to implant in a single subject. At 5th level, a chart caster can implant two different subjects with multiple instances of one trick each and can choose a different trick for each subject. The number of additional subjects increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he has beyond 5th.</p>
			<p>Using this ability again on an existing subject or to implant any trick on a new subject ends all previously implanted tricks. The caster can trigger only one instance of the same trick on a given subject per round.</p>
			<p>This alters mesmerist tricks and manifold tricks.</p>
			<p><b>Towering Ego (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a mesmerist gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 0) on Will saving throws. If the mesmerist is under any effect that would prevent him from providing the emotional component of psychic spells (see page 144), he loses this bonus on saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Bold Stare (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can&#146;t be changed later. The mesmerist can&#146;t choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist&#146;s bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Feign Destiny (Su): </b>At 3rd level, as an immediate action, a chart caster can grant an ally a +1 competence bonus on a failed attack roll, saving throw, or skill check by reminding his ally of their destined success. The chart caster must use his ability within 1 round of the failed check, and his ally must be within 30 feet of him when he does. If the bonus is enough to turn the failure into a success, the ally succeeds at the check. At 6th level, the bonus increases to +2. At 10th level, it increases to +5. A chart caster can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>This replaces touch treatment.</p>
			<p><b>Manifold Tricks (Su): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can have two tricks implanted at a time. The number of concurrent tricks increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he possesses beyond 5th. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist&#146;s tricks).</p>
			<p><b>Mental Potency (Ex): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment or illusion spell he casts increase by 1. For enchantment and illusion spells he casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be). For example, a 5thlevel mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with sleep, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with hypnotism, and change the categories for color spray to &#147;3 HD or fewer,&#148; &#147;4 or 5 HD,&#148; and &#147;6 or more HD.&#148; The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p>
			<p><b>Glib Lie (Su): </b>At 11th level, a mesmerist can deceive truthdetecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the mesmerist&#146;s class level to succeed (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn&#146;t detect the mesmerist&#146;s lies or force him to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the mesmerist the glibness spell&#146;s bonus on Bluff checks.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>Rule Minds (Su): </b>At 20th level, a mesmerist can permanently mentally enslave a creature. When the mesmerist successfully affects the target of his hypnotic stare with an enchantment spell that requires a saving throw, he can force that creature to attempt a second Will saving throw with a DC equal to the spell&#146;s DC. The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn&#146;t a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can&#146;t be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
					<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist adds 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Bluff checks. In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesn&#146;t have Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of at least 13. He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater Feint.</p>

				<name type="string">Hypnotic Stare</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>

					<p>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
					<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
					<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>

				<name type="string">Painful Stare</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, an autohypnotist has mastered techniques that make his hypnotic stare ability more potent, but at a terrible cost&#151;the autohypnotist succumbs to his own power when he uses it. Whenever the autohypnotist focuses his stare on an opponent, the penalties that opponent takes from the hypnotic stare (as well as any bold stare improvements or stare feats that the autohypnotist has) increase by 1. However, the autohypnotist takes the same penalties as his target while focusing his stare, including those of any bold stare improvements he has.</p>
					<p>An autohypnotist can reduce or negate the penalty he imposes upon himself with his hypnotic stare, but doing so allows his opponent an opportunity to escape from the stare as well. The autohypnotist can reduce the penalty he takes from his hypnotic stare ability by half for 1 round as a swift action. If he does so, there is a 25% chance that his hypnotic stare ends altogether. Alternatively, he can choose to negate the penalty he takes from his hypnotic stare for 1 round, but his hypnotic stare then has a 50% chance of ending.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>An autohypnotist has incredibly powerful psychic abilities that he can&#146;t entirely control. As a result, maintaining his powers against an opponent hinders him as much as his target.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Mesmerist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Autohypnosis (Su): </b>At 1st level, an autohypnotist has mastered techniques that make his hypnotic stare ability more potent, but at a terrible cost&#151;the autohypnotist succumbs to his own power when he uses it. Whenever the autohypnotist focuses his stare on an opponent, the penalties that opponent takes from the hypnotic stare (as well as any bold stare improvements or stare feats that the autohypnotist has) increase by 1. However, the autohypnotist takes the same penalties as his target while focusing his stare, including those of any bold stare improvements he has.</p>
			<p>An autohypnotist can reduce or negate the penalty he imposes upon himself with his hypnotic stare, but doing so allows his opponent an opportunity to escape from the stare as well. The autohypnotist can reduce the penalty he takes from his hypnotic stare ability by half for 1 round as a swift action. If he does so, there is a 25% chance that his hypnotic stare ends altogether. Alternatively, he can choose to negate the penalty he takes from his hypnotic stare for 1 round, but his hypnotic stare then has a 50% chance of ending.</p>
			<p>This ability alters hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Consummate Liar: </b>A mesmerist adds 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Bluff checks. In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesn&#146;t have Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of at least 13. He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater Feint.</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su): </b>A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to &#150;3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target&#146;s mind; the creature doesn&#146;t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist&#146;s focus than the target&#146;s perception of his stare. It can&#146;t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist&#146;s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists&#146; stares don&#146;t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches&#146; evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Painful Stare (Su): </b>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn&#146;t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists&#146; painful stares in a round.</p>
			<p><b>Towering Ego (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a mesmerist gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 0) on Will saving throws. If the mesmerist is under any effect that would prevent him from providing the emotional component of psychic spells (see page 144), he loses this bonus on saving throws.</p>
			<p><b>Bold Stare (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can&#146;t be changed later. The mesmerist can&#146;t choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist&#146;s bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare.</p>
			<p><b>Touch Treatment (Su): </b>At 3rd level, the mesmerist can help allies shake off harmful conditions&#151;especially those that affect their minds&#151;by channeling psychic energy through his healing hands. He can use touch treatment a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the mesmerist uses it on himself ), and the mesmerist must be able to touch his target. He can remove one condition from one target each time he uses this ability. At 3rd level, he can remove any condition on the minor conditions list. At 6th level, he can remove any condition on the minor or moderate conditions list, and at 10th level, he can remove any condition on the minor, moderate, or greater conditions list.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Minor Conditions: </i>Fascinated, shaken.</li>
				<li><i>Moderate Conditions: </i>Confused, dazed, frightened, sickened.</li>
				<li><i>Greater Conditions: </i>Cowering, nauseated, panicked, stunned.</li>
			</list>
			<p>A 14th level, the mesmerist can instead expend one use of touch treatment to replicate the effects of break enchantment. This targets only one creature the mesmerist is touching and follows all other restrictions of touch treatment.</p>
			<p><b>Manifold Tricks (Su): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can have two tricks implanted at a time. The number of concurrent tricks increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he possesses beyond 5th. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist&#146;s tricks).</p>
			<p><b>Wide Stare (Su): </b>At 5th level, whenever an autohypnotist is focusing his stare on a foe, he can broaden his hypnotic stare as a standard action. When he does so, all creatures within 10 feet of his opponent take penalties from the mesmerist&#146;s hypnotic stare and bold stare class features as if he were maintaining his hypnotic stare against each of those creatures, except such creatures treat his hypnotic stare penalty as if it were 2 lower. When the autohypnotist uses this ability, he cannot exclude allies or any other creatures from this effect. If the autohypnotist&#146;s hypnotic stare ends for the focused opponent, this effect ends.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces mental potency.</p>
			<p><b>Glib Lie (Su): </b>At 11th level, a mesmerist can deceive truthdetecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the mesmerist&#146;s class level to succeed (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn&#146;t detect the mesmerist&#146;s lies or force him to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the mesmerist the glibness spell&#146;s bonus on Bluff checks.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>Rule Minds (Su): </b>At 20th level, a mesmerist can permanently mentally enslave a creature. When the mesmerist successfully affects the target of his hypnotic stare with an enchantment spell that requires a saving throw, he can force that creature to attempt a second Will saving throw with a DC equal to the spell&#146;s DC. The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn&#146;t a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can&#146;t be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.</p>

The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick.

					<p>At 3rd level, the aromaphile can touch a creature affected by his hypnotic aroma to alter its mental state. This functions as the touch treatment class feature, except the aromaphile cannot remove the confused, cowering, or stunned conditions, and he cannot break enchantments using this ability. Instead, he adds fatigued to his list of minor conditions and exhausted to his list of greater conditions.</p>
					<p>An aromaphile can also use this ability to inflict hampering conditions on a target by touching it. At 3rd level, he can cause his target to become fascinated by his aroma. At 6th level, he can deaden the target&#146;s emotions (as per calm emotions). At 10th level, he can cause the target to become stunned. At 14th level, he can cause the target to fall asleep (as per deep slumber, except the Hit Die limit is equal to the aromaphile&#146;s level + 2). The target can attempt a Will save to negate these effects (DC = 10 + half the aromaphile&#146;s level + the aromaphile&#146;s Charisma modifier). On a failed save, the target gains the chosen condition for a number of rounds equal to the aromaphile&#146;s level. Each round that the target is affected, it can attempt a new Will save at the same DC to end the effect early. If the target succeeds at such a save, its turn immediately ends.</p>
					<p>This alters touch treatment and replaces mental potency.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Rather than employ the baleful glares of the typical mesmerist, aromaphiles hypnotize others using an array of sickeningly sweet scents developed from their unique ghoran physiology.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others&#151;usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can&#146;t comprehend.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes&#146; wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies&#151;and often themselves&#151;with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren&#146;t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Race: </b>Ghoran Only</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Mesmerist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>The mesmerist&#146;s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist&#146;s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&#150;5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist&#146;s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn&#146;t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1&#150;5 are fixed.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>
			<p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
			<p><b>Consummate Liar: </b>A mesmerist adds 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Bluff checks. In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesn&#146;t have Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of at least 13. He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater Feint.</p>
			<p><b>Hypnotic Aroma (Su): </b>As a swift action, an aromaphile can use unique aspects of ghoran biology to release intoxicating aromas in a 10-foot-radius burst centered on him. All creatures within this area, as well as creatures with scent within 30 feet, take a &#150;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty becomes &#150;3 at 8th level. The aroma hovers around the aromaphile, moving with him, and lasts for 1 minute. The hypnotic aroma must be inhaled to be effective, and creatures that choose to hold their breath, do not breathe, or are immune to inhaled poisons are immune to its effect.</p>
			<p>This replaces hypnotic stare, painful stare, and towering ego.</p>
			<p><b>Knacks: </b>Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1&#150;5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p>
			<p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su): </b>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p>
			<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick&#146;s description), even if it isn&#146;t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick&#146;s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn&#146;t need line of sight to trigger it&#151;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can&#146;t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick&#146;s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist&#146;s level + the mesmerist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick&#146;s description, a mesmerist can&#146;t choose a particular trick more than once.</p>
			<p><b>Aromatic Manipulation (Su): </b>At 3rd level, the aromaphile can touch a creature affected by his hypnotic aroma to alter its mental state. This functions as the touch treatment class feature, except the aromaphile cannot remove the confused, cowering, or stunned conditions, and he cannot break enchantments using this ability. Instead, he adds fatigued to his list of minor conditions and exhausted to his list of greater conditions.</p>
			<p>An aromaphile can also use this ability to inflict hampering conditions on a target by touching it. At 3rd level, he can cause his target to become fascinated by his aroma. At 6th level, he can deaden the target&#146;s emotions (as per calm emotions). At 10th level, he can cause the target to become stunned. At 14th level, he can cause the target to fall asleep (as per deep slumber, except the Hit Die limit is equal to the aromaphile&#146;s level + 2). The target can attempt a Will save to negate these effects (DC = 10 + half the aromaphile&#146;s level + the aromaphile&#146;s Charisma modifier). On a failed save, the target gains the chosen condition for a number of rounds equal to the aromaphile&#146;s level. Each round that the target is affected, it can attempt a new Will save at the same DC to end the effect early. If the target succeeds at such a save, its turn immediately ends.</p>
			<p>This alters touch treatment and replaces mental potency.</p>
			<p><b>Debilitating Aroma (Su): </b>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, an aromaphile can imbue his hypnotic aroma with other effects. These effects are the same as those listed within the bold stare mesmerist class feature, but they affect creatures affected by his hypnotic aroma for as long as they are affected by that ability. The aromaphile chooses one option each time he gains a new debilitating aroma improvement, and the choice can&#146;t be changed later. The aromaphile can&#146;t choose the same debilitating aroma more than once unless otherwise noted.</p>
			<p>This replaces bold stare.</p>
			<p><b>Touch Treatment (Su): </b>At 3rd level, the mesmerist can help allies shake off harmful conditions&#151;especially those that affect their minds&#151;by channeling psychic energy through his healing hands. He can use touch treatment a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the mesmerist uses it on himself ), and the mesmerist must be able to touch his target. He can remove one condition from one target each time he uses this ability. At 3rd level, he can remove any condition on the minor conditions list. At 6th level, he can remove any condition on the minor or moderate conditions list, and at 10th level, he can remove any condition on the minor, moderate, or greater conditions list.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Minor Conditions: </i>Fascinated, shaken.</li>
				<li><i>Moderate Conditions: </i>Confused, dazed, frightened, sickened.</li>
				<li><i>Greater Conditions: </i>Cowering, nauseated, panicked, stunned.</li>
			</list>
			<p>A 14th level, the mesmerist can instead expend one use of touch treatment to replicate the effects of break enchantment. This targets only one creature the mesmerist is touching and follows all other restrictions of touch treatment.</p>
			<p><b>Manifold Tricks (Su): </b>At 5th level, the mesmerist can have two tricks implanted at a time. The number of concurrent tricks increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he possesses beyond 5th. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist&#146;s tricks).</p>
			<p><b>Glib Lie (Su): </b>At 11th level, a mesmerist can deceive truthdetecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the mesmerist&#146;s class level to succeed (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn&#146;t detect the mesmerist&#146;s lies or force him to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the mesmerist the glibness spell&#146;s bonus on Bluff checks.</p>
			<p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su): </b>At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p>
			<p><b>Rule Minds (Su): </b>At 20th level, a mesmerist can permanently mentally enslave a creature. When the mesmerist successfully affects the target of his hypnotic stare with an enchantment spell that requires a saving throw, he can force that creature to attempt a second Will saving throw with a DC equal to the spell&#146;s DC. The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn&#146;t a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can&#146;t be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.</p>
