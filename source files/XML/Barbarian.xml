					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>-</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>
					<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d12</p>

					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power.

							<p>A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>Some barbarians are born or bred outside the reach of civilization. These wildborn fight and survive without ever seeing a forge or worked stone, and only dare a trip into the city when no other option is available.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A wildborn is proficient with leather and hide armors (but not shields) and all simple weapons that can be crafted from bone, stone, or wood. In addition, a wildborn gains Improved Unarmed Strike and Catch Off-Guard as bonus feats at 1st level. If she uses any other kind of weapon or armor, she loses her abilities from this archetype (except illiteracy) for the next 24 hours.</p>
					<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex) </b>: A barbarian's land speed is faster than the norm for her race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when she is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because of any load carried or armor worn. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the barbarian's land speed.</p>
					<p><b>Illiteracy: </b>A wildborn cannot read or write. She can learn to read or write a language only if she takes a level in another class, and even then only by taking 1 or more ranks in Linguistics.</p>
					<p><b>Rage (Ex) </b>: A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
					<p>While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>Bonus Feats: </b>At 4th level, 10th level and 16th level, a wildborn can choose a bonus feat from the following rather than select a rage power: Alertness, Animal Affinity, Athletic, Great Fortitude, Improvised Weapon Mastery, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Self-Sufficient, Stealthy, or Throw Anything.</p>
					<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 2nd level, a barbarian gains the ability to react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, even if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A barbarian with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
					<p>If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
					<p><b>Live Off the Land (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a wildborn can survive capably in the wilderness without any sort of manufactured equipment or gear. She adds half her barbarian level as a bonus on Survival checks to hunt or gather food and gains a +1 bonus on Fortitude saves to resist the effects of extreme temperatures or other environmental effects; the Fortitude save bonus increases by 1 at 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter.</p>
					<p>This replaces trap sense.</p>
					<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the barbarian by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels.</p>
					<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex) </b>: At 7th level, a barbarian gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Inexhaustible (Ex): </b>Wildborn live ruggedly and sleep lightly. At 7th level, a wildborn recovers nonlethal damage for each minute of rest as if an hour had passed. She applies twice her damage reduction gained from barbarian levels against nonlethal damage.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Rage (Ex) </b>: At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +3.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex) </b>: While in rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she also receives during her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Rage (Ex) </b>: Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Rage (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +8 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +4.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>Rages are barely controlled, but there are those who wholly give in to their more savage side, letting their rages take them to a confusing and uncontrolled place of terrible savagery. These barbarians become beasts, consumed with absolute bloodlust to the point where they cannot tell friend from foe.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>
					<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d12</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
					<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex) </b>: A barbarian's land speed is faster than the norm for her race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when she is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because of any load carried or armor worn. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the barbarian's land speed.</p>
					<p><b>Rage (Ex) </b>: A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
					<p>While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>
					<p><b>Uncontrolled Rage (Ex): </b>A wild rager&#146;s rage functions as normal, except that when she reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points, she must attempt a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the barbarian&#146;s level + the barbarian&#146;s Constitution modifier) or become confused. For the remainder of her current turn, she attacks the nearest creature other than herself. On the following round, refer to the confusion spell to determine her actions. At the end of this round, and each round thereafter, she can attempt a new saving throw to end the confusion effect. The rounds during which she is confused do not count against the rounds she has spent raging that day, but she cannot end her rage voluntarily, nor can she use rage powers while confused.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>Wild Fighting (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, even when not raging, wild ragers often fight with reckless, savage abandon. A wild rager using the full-attack action can make one extra attack per round at her highest base attack bonus. Until the beginning of her next turn, however, she takes a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls and &#150;4 penalty to AC. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.</p>
					<p><b>Trap Sense (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses increase by +1 every three barbarian levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level). Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Conversion (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a wild rager who fails a saving throw against any mind-affecting effect can attempt a new saving throw at the beginning of her next turn. If the save succeeds, that effect ends and she instead rages and becomes confused as noted above. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex) </b>: At 7th level, a barbarian gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Rage (Ex) </b>: At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +3.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex) </b>: While in rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she also receives during her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Rage (Ex) </b>: Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Rage (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +8 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +4.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>Every barbarian knows that city life can soften the spirit and the body, but some barbarians take on the trappings and ways of their adoptive homes and bend their savage powers to its challenges. While these urban barbarians&#146; rough edges are smoothed into civility, they can use their primal nature and upbringing to move with the ebb and flow of civilization&#146;s natural rhythms.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
					<p><b>Crowd Control (Ex): </b>At 1st level, an urban barbarian gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC when adjacent to two or more enemies. In addition, her movement is not impeded by crowds, and she gains a bonus equal to 1/2 her barbarian level on Intimidate checks to influence crowds. This ability replaces fast movement.</p>
					<p><b>Controlled Rage (Ex): </b>When an urban barbarian rages, instead of making a normal rage she applies a +4 morale bonus to her Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. This bonus increases to +6 when she gains greater rage and +8 when she gains mighty rage. She may apply the full bonus to one ability score or may split the bonus between several scores in increments of +2. When using a controlled rage, an urban barbarian gains no bonus on Will saves, takes no penalties to AC, and can still use Intelligence-, Dexterity-, and Charisma-based skills. This ability otherwise follows the normal rules for rage.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 2nd level, a barbarian gains the ability to react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, even if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A barbarian with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
					<p>If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
					<p><b>Trap Sense (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses increase by +1 every three barbarian levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level). Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.</p>
					<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the barbarian by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels.</p>
					<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex) </b>: At 7th level, a barbarian gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Controlled Rage (Ex) </b>: At 11th level, when a barbarian enters a controlled rage, the morale bonus to her Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution increases to +6.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex) </b>: While in rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she also receives during her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Rage (Ex) </b>: Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Rage (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, when a barbarian enters a controlled rage, the morale bonus to her Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution increases to +8.</p>

							<p>A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>There are no rules in the wild. Some barbarians enter combat with only victory in mind and do anything in their power to achieve it.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
					<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex) </b>: A barbarian's land speed is faster than the norm for her race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when she is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because of any load carried or armor worn. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the barbarian's land speed.</p>
					<p><b>Rage (Ex) </b>: A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
					<p>While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>Despicable Tactics: </b>At 2nd level, the untamed rager gains Improved Dirty Trick as a bonus feat. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.</p>
					<p><b>Feral Appearance (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, the untamed rager gains a +1 bonus on Intimidate checks. This bonus increases by 1 every 3 barbarian levels thereafter. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
					<p><b>Deplorable Tactics: </b>At 5th level, the untamed rager gains Greater Dirty Trick as a bonus feat. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
					<p><b>Dishonorable (Ex): </b>At 7th level and every 3 barbarian levels thereafter, the untamed rager gains a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks when performing dirty tricks and to her CMD to resist others&#146; dirty tricks. This ability replaces damage reduction.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Rage (Ex) </b>: At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +3.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex) </b>: While in rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she also receives during her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Rage (Ex) </b>: Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Rage (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +8 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +4.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>Isolated and xenophobic tribes that dwell in areas untouched by civilization often see anything from cities and organized settlements as strange, dangerous, and decadent. They gain power from their truly primitive nature; their bodies and spirits are hardened by the wild and untainted existence far from the pathetic softness of so-called civilization. Even when forced to mingle with civilization, the true primitive stays apart in both traditions and trappings.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A true primitive is proficient with hide armor and armors made from bone. A true primitive is also proficient with bone shields and the following weapons: battleaxe, blowgun, club, greatclub, handaxe, longspear, shortspear, sling, and spear.</p>
					<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex) </b>: A true primitive has a favored terrain representing her native homeland. This ability functions as the ranger class feature, and the true primitive&#146;s bonuses in that terrain improve by +2 at 5th level and every five levels thereafter. However, she does not gain any additional favored terrains. This ability replaces fast movement.</p>
					<p><b>Illiteracy: </b>A true primitive cannot read or write, and her superstition about such things leads her to refuse to ever learn to read or write, even if she multiclasses into other classes.</p>
					<p><b>Rage (Ex) </b>: A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
					<p>While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 2nd level, a barbarian gains the ability to react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, even if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A barbarian with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
					<p>If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
					<p><b>Trophy Fetish (Ex): </b>A true primitive collects teeth, bones, hair, and other trophies from vanquished enemies, representing their power and strength. At 3rd level, a true primitive can attach a trophy fetish to one of the traditional true primitive weapons listed above. When wielding that weapon, the true primitive gains a +1 morale bonus on damage rolls. Furthermore, if that weapon has the fragile property, once per day, the true primitive can ignore the effects of a single natural 1 roll. A trophy fetish can also be attached to a suit of hide or bone armor, granting the true primitive a +1 morale bonus on saving throws. Furthermore, if that armor has the fragile property, once per day, the true primitive can chose not to have the armor break on the confirmation of a critical hit made against her. Every five levels beyond 3rd, a true primitive can use an additional trophy fetish. Multiple trophy fetishes can be attached to the same armor or weapon; their effects stack. A trophy fetish can be sundered (hardness 5, 1 hit point) but is not damaged by area attacks or attacks that do not specifically target it. It has no effect if attached to other types of weapons or armor. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
					<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the barbarian by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels.</p>
					<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex) </b>: At 7th level, a barbarian gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Rage (Ex) </b>: At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +3.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex) </b>: While in rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she also receives during her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Rage (Ex) </b>: Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Rage (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +8 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +4.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>A barbarian often has a special totem that is the patron of her tribe. While individual totems vary, those in the tribe that call upon a totem receive similar abilities. Totem warrior barbarians can select from the following rage powers.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>
					<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d12</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
					<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex) </b>: A barbarian's land speed is faster than the norm for her race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when she is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because of any load carried or armor worn. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the barbarian's land speed.</p>
					<p><b>Rage (Ex) </b>: A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
					<p>While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 2nd level, a barbarian gains the ability to react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, even if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A barbarian with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
					<p>If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
					<p><b>Trap Sense (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses increase by +1 every three barbarian levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level). Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.</p>
					<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the barbarian by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels.</p>
					<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex) </b>: At 7th level, a barbarian gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Rage (Ex) </b>: At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +3.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex) </b>: While in rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she also receives during her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Rage (Ex) </b>: Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Rage (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +8 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +4.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>In lands overrun by giants, dragons, and other hulking beasts, entire fellowships of barbarians hone tactics and traditions with one purpose&#151;to bring low these massive foes. While her enemies&#146; size makes the creatures strong, the titan mauler is even stronger, taking up weapons from her fallen foes that no lesser warrior can lift, and using them when she beseeches the spirits to grant her increased size and greater ferocity against her titanic foes.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
					<p><b>Big Game Hunter (Ex): </b>A titan mauler gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC in melee with creatures larger than themselves. This ability replaces fast movement.</p>
					<p><b>Rage (Ex) </b>: A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
					<p>While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>Jotungrip (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a titan mauler may choose to wield a two-handed melee weapon in one hand with a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls while doing so. The weapon must be appropriately sized for her, and it is treated as one-handed when determining the effect of Power Attack, Strength bonus to damage, and the like. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.</p>
					<p><b>Massive Weapons (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, a titan mauler becomes skilled in the use of massive weapons looted from her titanic foes. She can use two-handed weapons meant for creatures one size category larger, but the penalty for doing so is increased by 4. However, the attack roll penalty for using weapons too large for her size is reduced by 1, and this reduction increases by 1 for every three levels beyond 3rd (to a minimum of 0). This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
					<p><b>Evade Reach (Ex): </b>At 5th level, as a swift action, a titan mauler may choose one creature within her line of sight. Until the end of her turn, that target&#146;s reach is treated as if it were 5 feet shorter with respect to reaching the titan mauler, and this reduction increases by 5 feet for every five levels beyond 5th. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex) </b>: At 7th level, a barbarian gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Rage (Ex) </b>: At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +3.</p>
					<p><b>Titanic Rage (Su): </b>At 14th level, a titan mauler may choose to gain the benefits of enlarge person when she enters a rage. While using titanic rage, she must spend 2 rounds of rage per round, and she becomes exhausted rather than fatigued when the rage ends. This ability replaces indomitable will.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Rage (Ex) </b>: Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Rage (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +8 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +4.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>Many barbarians distrust magic. While most just shy away from magic, others focus their rage on users of such foul arts. These barbarians are naturally distrusting, and develop keen senses to protect them from harm. A superstitious barbarian has the following class features.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>
					<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d12</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
					<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex) </b>: A barbarian's land speed is faster than the norm for her race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when she is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because of any load carried or armor worn. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the barbarian's land speed.</p>
					<p><b>Rage (Ex) </b>: A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
					<p>While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 2nd level, a barbarian gains the ability to react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, even if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A barbarian with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
					<p>If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
					<p><b>Sixth Sense (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, the superstitious barbarian gains a +1 bonus on initiative and a +1 insight bonus to AC during surprise rounds. This bonus increases by +1 for every three levels after 3rd. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
					<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the barbarian by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels.</p>
					<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
					<p><b>Keen Senses (Ex) </b>: At 7th level, the superstitious barbarian gains low-light vision (triple normal vision range in dim light if she already has low-light vision). At 10th level, she gains darkvision 60 feet (or adds 60 feet to the range of any darkvision already possessed). At 13th level, she gains scent. At 16th level, she gains blindsense 30 feet. At 19th level, she gains blindsight 30 feet. This ability replaces damage reduction.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Rage (Ex) </b>: At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +3.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex) </b>: While in rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she also receives during her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Rage (Ex) </b>: Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Rage (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +8 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +4.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>The Shoanti tribes who live in the Cinderlands have turned the deadly emberstorms that plague the region into a rite of passage. A few who survive the experience begin to embrace the adrenaline and surge of joy that comes from dancing along the edge of a whirling firestorm. These thrill-seekers are known as burn riders, and their exploits are celebrated by all Shoanti. Burn riders learn early on that speed and lightning-quick reactions are essential to avoid becoming trapped by the fickle whims of a raging emberstorm. They have an uncanny understanding of fire and can read the currents in the smoke.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
					<p><b>Flame Runner (Ex) </b>: At 1st level, once per rage, a burn rider can goad her mount into a burst of incredible speed. The mount&#146;s speed increases by 10 feet until the end of the burn rider&#146;s turn. This bonus to speed increases by 10 feet at 9th level and again at 15th level. This ability replaces fast movement.</p>
					<p><b>Rage (Ex) </b>: A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
					<p>While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>Cinder Sight (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a Shoanti burn rider can see through fire, fog, and smoke without penalty as long as the light is sufficient to allow her to see normally. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.</p>
					<p><b>Cinder Dance (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, when a burn rider succeeds at a Reflex save to avoid fire damage, she can spend an immediate action to move up to half her speed. If the burn rider ends this movement outside the area of effect, she takes no damage from the effect. After this sudden movement, the burn rider is staggered until the end of her next turn. If the burn rider is mounted, her mount makes the movement instead, and both the mount and the burn rider are staggered until the end of the burn rider&#146;s next turn. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
					<p><b>Mount: </b>At 4th level, a burn rider gains a loyal mount. This ability functions like the druid&#146;s animal companion ability (as described in the nature bond class feature), except that the burn rider always gains a horse or pony (though she can gain additional options at the GM&#146;s discretion) and her effective druid level is equal to her Shoanti burn rider level &#150; 3. This ability replaces the rage powers gained at 4th, 8th, 12th, and 16th level.</p>
					<p><b>Give Me Fire (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, if a Shoanti burn rider takes fire damage while raging, she regains 1 round of rage. The burn rider regains the round of rage only if the fire damage bypasses or exceeds any energy resistance or other protections in effect. The burn rider can only regain 1 round of rage per round. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex) </b>: At 7th level, a barbarian gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Rage (Ex) </b>: At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +3.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex) </b>: While in rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she also receives during her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Rage (Ex) </b>: Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Rage (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +8 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +4.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>Coastal hunters and agents of the ocean&#146;s rage, sharptooth barbarians emulate the greatest predators of the sea. Sharks, in particular, are respected and admired by many such tribes, if not as manifestations of divine power, then merely as scions of the power and fury of the natural world.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
					<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex) </b>: A barbarian's land speed is faster than the norm for her race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when she is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because of any load carried or armor worn. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the barbarian's land speed.</p>
					<p><b>Rage (Ex) </b>: A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
					<p>While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 2nd level, a barbarian gains the ability to react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, even if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A barbarian with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
					<p>If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
					<p><b>Trap Sense (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses increase by +1 every three barbarian levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level). Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.</p>
					<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the barbarian by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels.</p>
					<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex) </b>: At 7th level, a barbarian gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Rage (Ex) </b>: At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +3.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex) </b>: While in rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she also receives during her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Rage (Ex) </b>: Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Rage (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +8 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +4.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>Not all barbarians hunt forests, plains, and mountains. Some are raiding terrors on the sea and coasts, pillaging those who hoard treasure and pursuing monsters of the deep. Some sea reavers are no more than hunters of the open sea, while others are raiders striking fear into coastal settlements within reach of the sea reavers&#146; longships.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
					<p><b>Marine Terror (Ex) </b>: A sea reaver can hold her breath for a number of rounds equal to four times her Constitution score. In addition, a sea reaver can move normally though squares of standing water or bog that is 1 foot deep. It does not cost her extra movement to traverse these terrains. Lastly, a sea reaver ignores the normal cover bonus to AC when attacking creatures that are partially immersed in water. This ability replaces fast movement.</p>
					<p><b>Rage (Ex) </b>: A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
					<p>While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>Eyes of the Storm (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a sea reaver ignores any concealment provided by fog, rain, sleet, mist, wind, or other weather effects that is less than total concealment, and any penalties weather applies on Perception checks are halved. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.</p>
					<p><b>Savage Sailor (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a sea reaver gains a +1 bonus on Acrobatics, Climb, Profession (sailor), Survival, and Swim checks made in aquatic terrain, including aboard a ship or along shorelines. These bonuses improve by +1 every three levels after 3rd. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
					<p><b>Sure-Footed (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a sea reaver takes no penalties when moving across slick surfaces, whether natural or magical (e.g., grease, ice storm, and sleet storm). She is not at risk of falling, is not denied her Dexterity bonus when moving across such areas, and does not treat them as difficult terrain. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex) </b>: At 7th level, a barbarian gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Rage (Ex) </b>: At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +3.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex) </b>: While in rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she also receives during her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Rage (Ex) </b>: Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Rage (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +8 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +4.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>Some barbarians wear marks of prowess and savagery upon their bodies. The scarred rager believes each wound tells the tales of her prowess and bravery. She augments these ragged trophies with brands and tattoos in order to win the notice and favor of her gods, ancestors, or totem spirits. The scarred rager&#146;s gnarled and exotic appearance terrifies civilized onlookers, but is awe-inspiring to her savage kin.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
					<p><b>Terrifying Visage (Ex): </b>A scarred rager adds 1/2 her barbarian level on Intimidate checks against humanoids who are not members of barbarian tribes. When dealing with barbarians, the scarred rager may choose to add this bonus on Diplomacy checks instead. The DC of any fear effect created by the scarred rager also increases by 1. This ability replaces fast movement.</p>
					<p><b>Rage (Ex) </b>: A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
					<p>While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>Tolerance (Ex) </b>: At 2nd level, a scarred rager who fails a save against an effect that causes her to become nauseated, sickened, fatigued, or exhausted can make a second save to negate the effect on the start of her next turn. Only one additional save is allowed. If the effect does not allow a saving throw, its duration is halved instead (minimum of 1 round). This ability replaces uncanny dodge.</p>
					<p><b>Scarification (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a scarred rager can ignore 1 point of bleed damage per round. This amount increases by 1 every three levels beyond 3rd. At 15th level, a scarred rager can ignore 1 bleed effect each round. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
					<p><b>Improved Tolerance (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a scarred rager&#146;s tolerance ability also applies to effects that would cause her to become dazed, frightened, shaken, or stunned. This replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex) </b>: At 7th level, a barbarian gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Rage (Ex) </b>: At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +3.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex) </b>: While in rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she also receives during her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Rage (Ex) </b>: Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Rage (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +8 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +4.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>Savage technologists exhort Kellids to rise up against the depredations of the Technic League. But rather than rejecting technology, they wield the League&#146;s own weapons against it. A savage technologist has the following class features.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>
					<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d12</p>
					<h>Class Skills</h>
					<p>Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Sense Motive Wis), Perception (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
					<p><b>Skill Ranks per Level: </b>4</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
					<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex) </b>: A barbarian's land speed is faster than the norm for her race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when she is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because of any load carried or armor worn. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the barbarian's land speed.</p>
					<p><b>Rage (Ex): </b>A savage technologist can enter rage as a barbarian, except she gains a morale bonus to Strength and Dexterity instead of Strength and Constitution, and she does not take a penalty to Armor Class. She retains the bonus on Will saving throws. When a barbarian ability would increase the savage technologist&#146;s Strength while raging, it increases her Dexterity instead. This ability alters rage.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>Sword and Gun (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, when a raging savage technologist wields a one-handed firearm in one hand and a light or one-handed melee weapon in the other, she can make ranged attacks with the firearm without provoking attacks of opportunity. She also gains the benefits of the Two-Weapon Fighting feat, but only if all attacks are made with those weapons. This ability replaces Uncanny Dodge.</p>
					<p><b>Primal Magnetism (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a savage technologist adds her Strength modifier on Diplomacy checks when interacting with tribal cultures. She can expend 2 rounds of rage (even if not raging) to add a bonus equal to 1/2 his barbarian level on a Diplomacy check.</p>
					<p><b>Crack Shot (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a savage technologist adds her Dexterity modifier to her damage rolls when making ranged attacks with a firearm while raging. This ability replaces Improved Uncanny Dodge.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex) </b>: At 7th level, a barbarian gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Rage (Ex) </b>: At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +3.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex) </b>: While in rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she also receives during her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Rage (Ex) </b>: Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Rage (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +8 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +4.</p>

							<p>A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>Some barbarians are truly savage, having little training in modern arms. These savage barbarians learn to avoid blows and toughen up their skin. A savage barbarian has the following class features.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>
					<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d12</p>
					<h>Class Skills</h>
					<p>Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str)</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
					<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex) </b>: A barbarian's land speed is faster than the norm for her race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when she is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because of any load carried or armor worn. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the barbarian's land speed.</p>
					<p><b>Rage (Ex) </b>: A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
					<p>While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 2nd level, a barbarian gains the ability to react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, even if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A barbarian with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
					<p>If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
					<p><b>Naked Courage (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, the savage barbarian gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC and a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against fear when wearing no armor (shields are allowed). This bonus increases by +1 for every six levels after 3rd. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
					<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the barbarian by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels.</p>
					<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
					<p><b>Natural Toughness (Ex): </b>At 7th level, the savage barbarian gains a +1 natural armor bonus to AC when wearing no armor (shields are allowed). This bonus increases by +1 for every three levels beyond 7th. This ability replaces damage reduction.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Rage (Ex) </b>: At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +3.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex) </b>: While in rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she also receives during her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Rage (Ex) </b>: Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Rage (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +8 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +4.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>While savagery is not inherently evil, some barbaric cultures thrive on depravity and welcome the act of feeding on their own kind. The raging cannibal is a barbarian who feasts upon her fallen opponents not out of hunger, or even a taste for flesh, but rather because she believes consuming her foes and defiling their lost lives demonstrates her strength. This penchant for feasting on the flesh of her kin makes the raging cannibal an awkward companion to travel with for many groups, with rumors revolving around the raging cannibal&#146;s culinary exploits often causing tense situations that other party members might be called upon to resolve via diplomacy before the raging cannibal grows frustrated and decides to take matters into her own hands!</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>
					<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d12</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
					<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex) </b>: A barbarian's land speed is faster than the norm for her race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when she is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because of any load carried or armor worn. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the barbarian's land speed.</p>
					<p><b>Rage (Ex) </b>: A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
					<p>While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>Consume Vigor (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, when a raging cannibal reduces a creature of the same creature type as herself to 0 or fewer hit points with her bite attack during combat while raging, she can consume a chunk of its body to gain a portion of its power. If the creature&#146;s CR equals or exceeds her barbarian level, the raging cannibal gains 1 additional round of rage. She can never consume the same creature&#146;s vigor more than once. At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the raging cannibal gains 1 additional round of rage each time she uses this ability.</p>
					<p><b>Intimidating Gouge (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, when a raging cannibal confirms a critical hit against a creature of the same creature type as herself with her bite attack while raging, she gains a bonus on Intimidate checks equal to half her barbarian level for the duration of the rage.</p>
					<p><b>Feed from Fury (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a raging cannibal is empowered by eating her enemies during combat. When a raging cannibal confirms a critical hit against a creature of the same creature type as herself with her bite attack while raging, she gains a number of temporary hit points equal to her barbarian level. These temporary hit points stack with other temporary hit points gained from this ability but not with those from other sources. These temporary hit points fade after a period of time equal to 10 minutes per barbarian level.</p>
					<p><b>Razor-Toothed Fury (Ex) </b>: At 6th level, a raging cannibal&#146;s bite becomes even more fearsome. When using her bite attack, the raging cannibal can take a &#150;1 penalty on her attack roll to add 2 points of bleed damage to the damage dealt. At 10th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the attack penalty increases by 1 and the bleed damage increases by 2 points.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Rage (Ex) </b>: At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +3.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex) </b>: While in rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she also receives during her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Rage (Ex) </b>: Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Rage (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +8 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +4.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>Rather than exploding with anger, primal hunters focus their rage to strike distant targets. Though able to hold their own in melee, primal hunters specialize in using some of the oldest of ranged weapons: bows, slings, and spears.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
					<p><b>Exceptional Pull: </b>At 1st level, a primal hunter gains Exceptional Pull as a bonus feat, even if she doesn&#146;t meet the requirements. At 11th and 20th levels, the strength rating of weapons she wields increases by 1 (weapons without a strength rating are not affected). This ability replaces fast movement.</p>
					<p><b>Focused Rage (Ex): </b>While raging, a primal hunter gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls with ranged weapons. This bonus increases to +3 at 11th level and to +4 at 20th level. While raging, a primal hunter can attempt Stealth checks but doesn&#146;t gain a morale bonus on Will saves. This ability alters rage.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 2nd level, a barbarian gains the ability to react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, even if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A barbarian with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
					<p>If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
					<p><b>Trap Sense (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses increase by +1 every three barbarian levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level). Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.</p>
					<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the barbarian by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels.</p>
					<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex) </b>: At 7th level, a barbarian gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Rage (Ex) </b>: At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +3.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex) </b>: While in rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she also receives during her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Rage (Ex) </b>: Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Rage (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +8 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +4.</p>

							<p>A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>Barbarian rages can be a thing of savage beauty, exhibiting a lethal grace. While such uncontrolled displays of carnage often disregard group tactics, there are those barbarians whose rages inspire and spur on their allies during the ferocious dance of death.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>
					<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d12</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
					<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex) </b>: A barbarian's land speed is faster than the norm for her race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when she is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because of any load carried or armor worn. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the barbarian's land speed.</p>
					<p><b>Rage (Ex) </b>: A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
					<p>While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>
					<p><b>Bonus Feat: </b>At 2nd level and every 4 levels thereafter, the pack rager can take a bonus teamwork feat. This teamwork feat must also be a combat feat. This ability replaces the rage powers gained at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>Bonus Feat: </b>At 2nd level and every 4 levels thereafter, the pack rager can take a bonus teamwork feat. This teamwork feat must also be a combat feat. This ability replaces the rage powers gained at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level.</p>
					<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 2nd level, a barbarian gains the ability to react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, even if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A barbarian with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
					<p>If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
					<p><b>Trap Sense (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses increase by +1 every three barbarian levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level). Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.</p>
					<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the barbarian by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels.</p>
					<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
					<p><b>Raging Tactician: </b>At 7th level, while a pack rager is raging, she grants a single teamwork feat she knows to all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear her. She chooses the feat at the start of the rage, and cannot change it during the rage. An ally who moves more than 30 feet away from the raging pack rager loses access to the feat, but regains it again each time he moves back within 30 feet of the raging pack rager. Allies do not need to meet the prerequisites of these teamwork feats.</p>
					<p>At 13th level, the pack rager chooses two teamwork feats when she enters a rage, and grants her allies the use of both of those feats when they are within 30 feet of her.</p>
					<p>At 16th level, the pack rager grants these teamwork feats as long as her allies are within 60 feet of her.</p>
					<p>At 19th level, the pack rager chooses three teamwork feats when she enters a rage, and grants her allies the use of all three feats when they are within 60 feet of her.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Rage (Ex) </b>: At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +3.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex) </b>: While in rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she also receives during her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Rage (Ex) </b>: Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Rage (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +8 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +4.</p>

A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>Pack hunter barbarians team up to hunt dangerous prey to feed, to protect their camps, and as a rite of passage. Often, a tribe of pack hunters looks to a specific species of animal (such as wolves) who themselves hunt in packs, and view these animals as sacred manifestations of their people&#146;s traditions and values.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
					<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex) </b>: A barbarian's land speed is faster than the norm for her race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when she is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because of any load carried or armor worn. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the barbarian's land speed.</p>
					<p><b>Rage (Ex) </b>: A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
					<p>While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>Bonus Feats: </b>Whenever a pack hunter would gain a new rage power, she can instead select a teamwork feat. She must still meet the prerequisites for the teamwork feat.</p>
					<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 2nd level, a barbarian gains the ability to react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, even if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A barbarian with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
					<p>If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
					<p><b>Trap Sense (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses increase by +1 every three barbarian levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level). Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.</p>
					<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the barbarian by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels.</p>
					<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
					<p><b>Sympathetic Rage (Ex): </b>At 6th level, if an ally within 30 feet is bloodraging or raging, a pack hunter counts as raging even if knocked unconscious. She has to have been raging when incapacitated to maintain her rage, and she ceases raging normally if she depletes her maximum number of rounds of rage in a day.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex) </b>: At 7th level, a barbarian gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Rage (Ex) </b>: At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +3.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex) </b>: While in rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she also receives during her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Rage (Ex) </b>: Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Rage (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +8 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +4.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>The Kellid barbarians that roam Numeria&#146;s badlands have a healthy mistrust of technology and its corruptive influence. Since the cataclysmic Rain of Stars millennia ago, these warriors have developed numerous techniques and skills to protect themselves from the strange mechanical monsters that roam Numeria. While many native Kellids oppose the Technic League and its espousal of foul alien artifacts, the most stalwart and staunchly dedicated of these technophobic traditionalists refer to themselves as Numerian liberators.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>
					<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d12</p>
					<h>Class Skills</h>
					<p>Acrobatics (Dex), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), Stealth (Dex), and Swim (Str)</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
					<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex) </b>: A barbarian's land speed is faster than the norm for her race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when she is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because of any load carried or armor worn. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the barbarian's land speed.</p>
					<p><b>Rage (Ex) </b>: A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
					<p>While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>Hard Hitter (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a Numerian liberator can make devastating attacks against objects and foes with breakable components. Damage dealt by the barbarian&#146;s attacks ignores an amount of an object&#146;s or creature&#146;s hardness (if any) equal to 1/2 her class level. This ability replaces the uncanny dodge.</p>
					<p><b>Trap Sense (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses increase by +1 every three barbarian levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level). Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.</p>
					<p><b>Disruptor: </b>At 5th level, for any foes in a Numerian liberator&#146;s threatened area, the DC to cast spells defensively increases by 1. The DC increases by 1 again for every 5 levels thereafter (to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level). If the barbarian gains the disruptive rage power, the two abilities stack. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex) </b>: At 7th level, a barbarian gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Rage (Ex) </b>: At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +3.</p>
					<p><b>Hide from Constructs (Su): </b>At 14th level, a Numerian liberator can control her movement, breathing, body temperature, and other physiological signs to confuse the artificial visions of constructs. At will, the barbarian can make herself undetectable to constructs as if she were affected by a hide from undead spell that instead hides the subject from constructs. Intelligent constructs receive a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the barbarian&#146;s level + the barbarian&#146;s Constitution modifier) to see through this effect. The barbarian must expend 1 round of rage for each round she uses this ability. This ability replaces indomitable will.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Rage (Ex) </b>: Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Rage (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +8 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +4.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>Many barbarian tribes are masters of the horse, teaching their members how to ride from a young age. As a result, barbarians from such tribes are even more terrifying when mounted, using their steeds&#146; speed and strength to great advantage. A mounted fury has the following class features.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>
					<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d12</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
					<p><b>Fast Rider (Ex): </b>The speed of any mount the barbarian rides is increased by 10 feet. This ability replaces fast movement.</p>
					<p><b>Rage (Ex) </b>: A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
					<p>While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>Trap Sense (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses increase by +1 every three barbarian levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level). Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.</p>
					<p><b>Bestial Mount (Ex): </b>At 5th level, the mounted fury gains the service of a feral mount. This ability functions as a druid&#146;s animal companion, using the barbarian&#146;s level &#150;4 as her effective druid level. This companion must be one that she is capable of riding and is suitable as a mount. A Medium barbarian can select a camel or a horse. A Small barbarian can select a pony or a wolf, but can also select a boar or a dog if she is at least 8th level. Whenever a barbarian is raging while mounted on her bestial mount, the mount gains a +2 morale bonus to its Strength. This ability replaces uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex) </b>: At 7th level, a barbarian gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Rage (Ex) </b>: At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +3.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex) </b>: While in rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she also receives during her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Rage (Ex) </b>: Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Rage (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +8 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +4.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>Some barbarians exhibit an unusual form of lycanthropy powered by their fury. Such a character transforms willfully but can maintain her animal or hybrid forms only while raging.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<p><b>Race: </b>A mooncursed must either be a humanoid or monstrous humanoid.</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>
					<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d12</p>
					<h>Class Skills</h>
					<p>Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str)</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
					<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex) </b>: A barbarian's land speed is faster than the norm for her race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when she is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because of any load carried or armor worn. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the barbarian's land speed.</p>
					<p><b>Shifting Rage (Su): </b>A mooncursed can call upon an animal totem or inner curse, transforming her into a savage beast. Starting at 1st level, she chooses bear, boar, crocodile, shark, tiger, or wolf. Once chosen, this animal can&#146;t be changed. When using rounds of her shifting rage, instead of the usual bonuses and penalties from rage, the mooncursed transforms into a Medium version of this animal&#146;s form as if under the influence of beast shape I, treating her class level as her caster level whenever relevant. Other aspects of rage aside from the bonuses and penalties, such as the skill restrictions on skills and effects that require concentration, still apply during a shifting rage.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>Hybrid Rage (Su): </b>Beginning at 5th level, a mooncursed can choose to assume a hybrid of her base type and alternate form instead of her usual alternate form during her shifting rage. If she does, the animal&#146;s forelimbs (or pectoral fins for the shark) remain hands able to manipulate objects and wield weapons as well as human hands do, she can walk on two legs (the shark&#146;s tail fins remain legs), and she can talk.</p>
					<p><b>Trap Sense (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses increase by +1 every three barbarian levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level). Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.</p>
					<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the barbarian by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels.</p>
					<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex) </b>: At 7th level, a barbarian gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Shifting Rage (Su): </b>At 11th level, a mooncursed can assume larger alternate and hybrid forms. This functions like beast shape II, and it allows the mooncursed to take on a Medium or Large version of her animal&#146;s form.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex) </b>: While in rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she also receives during her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Rage (Ex) </b>: Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Shifting Rage (Su): </b>At 20th level, a mooncursed can assume even larger alternate and hybrid forms. This functions like beast shape III, and it allows the mooncursed to take on a Medium, Large, or Huge version of her animal&#146;s form.</p>

							<p>A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>Though named for the wild savages who fight alongside rabid dogs, mad dogs employ all manner of beasts as their battle brethren.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>More &#147;civilized&#148; folk sometimes scoff at the people of the Mwangi Expanse, dismissing them as primitives with inferior technology. Although some tribes do rely on wood and bone over metal, their greatest advantage comes from mastery of the terrain. A jungle rager can disappear from sight, strike from hiding, and use the environment to shield herself from harm.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>

					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
					<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex) </b>: A barbarian's land speed is faster than the norm for her race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when she is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because of any load carried or armor worn. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the barbarian's land speed.</p>
					<p><b>Rage (Ex) </b>: A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess.

					<p>While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>Home Ground Advantage (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a jungle rager learns how to make optimal use of the natural cover of her homeland. She chooses a specific terrain type from the ranger list of favored terrains. When in this terrain, she increases her bonus to AC and on Reflex saving throws gained from cover, partial cover, and improved cover (but not soft cover) by 1. In this terrain, she also increases the miss chance caused by concealment for attacks against her by 5%. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.</p>
					<p><b>Jungle Endurance (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a jungle rager gains a +1 bonus on Fortitude saves to resist the effects of hot weather and diseases. This bonus increases by +1 every 3 barbarian levels after 3rd. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
					<p><b>Home Ground Supremacy (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a jungle rager becomes even more capable when navigating and fighting in her preferred terrain. She gains the woodland stride ranger ability, though this ability works only in the terrain she selected for the home ground advantage ability. In this terrain, she gains an additional +1 bonus to AC when benefiting from cover or improved cover (but not soft cover). This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>A jungle rager gains this ability at 8th level, except her effective barbarian level for the ability is equal to her barbarian level &#150; 1. In addition, this damage reduction is doubled against damage dealt by creatures with the swarm subtype. This ability otherwise functions as the barbarian ability of the same name.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Rage (Ex) </b>: At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +3.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex) </b>: While in rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she also receives during her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Rage (Ex) </b>: Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.</p>

							<p>A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>Some barbarians learn to take whatever comes their way, shrugging off mortal wounds with ease. These barbarians invite their enemies to attack them, and use pain to fuel their rage. An invulnerable rager has the following class features.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>
					<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d12</p>
					<h>Class Skills</h>
					<p>Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str)</p>
					<p><b>Skill Ranks per Level: </b>4</p>

					<p><b>Invulnerability (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, the invulnerable rager gains DR/&#151; equal to half her barbarian level. This damage reduction is doubled against nonlethal damage. This ability replaces uncanny dodge, improved uncanny dodge, and damage reduction.</p>
					<p><b>Rage (Ex) </b>: A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds.

If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>Extreme Endurance (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, the invulnerable rager is inured to either hot or cold climate effects (choose one) as if using endure elements. In addition, the barbarian gains 1 point of fire or cold resistance for every three levels beyond 3rd. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Rage (Ex) </b>: At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +3.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex) </b>: While in rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she also receives during her rage.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>A raging barbarian is frightening enough in melee, but some become skilled at throwing objects at their foes before closing in for the kill. A hurler has the following class feature.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>
					<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d12</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
					<p><b>Skilled Thrower (Ex): </b>The hurler is skilled at throwing objects in combat. Increase the range increment of any thrown weapon or object by 10 feet. This ability replaces fast movement.</p>
					<p><b>Rage (Ex) </b>: A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
					<p>While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 2nd level, a barbarian gains the ability to react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, even if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A barbarian with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
					<p>If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
					<p><b>Trap Sense (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses increase by +1 every three barbarian levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level). Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.</p>
					<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the barbarian by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels.</p>
					<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex) </b>: At 7th level, a barbarian gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Rage (Ex) </b>: At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +3.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex) </b>: While in rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she also receives during her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Rage (Ex) </b>: Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Rage (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +8 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +4.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>From a young age, many half-orcs are treated cruelly, bullied, ridiculed, and made outcasts. While some hide their shame, others foster a deep, burning hatred that they channel into a raw fury and unleash against their enemies. These half-orcs are called hateful ragers. A hateful rager has the following class features.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
					<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex) </b>: A barbarian's land speed is faster than the norm for her race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when she is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because of any load carried or armor worn. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the barbarian's land speed.</p>
					<p><b>Rage (Ex) </b>: A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
					<p>While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>Favored Enemy (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a hateful rager selects a favored enemy. This ability works identically to the ranger ability of the same name. At 8th, 14th, and 20th level, the hateful rager selects another favored enemy and increases her bonus against one favored enemy type, as described in the ranger class.</p>
					<p>While raging, the hateful rager makes every effort to fight a favored enemy rather than other opponents. If aware of the presence of a favored enemy, the hateful rager must make a DC 20 Will save each round to attack another creature; failure means the barbarian must attack the favored enemy or move closer to that enemy. She may freely attack creatures preventing her from reaching that favored enemy (regardless of whether they are actively trying to prevent her attacks or merely in the way). She can avoid harmful obstacles normally in her attempts to reach the target and is not forced to take the shortest route.</p>
					<p>This ability replaces the barbarian&#146;s rage power gained at 2nd level. At 8th, 14th, and 20th levels, in place of a rage power she gains another favored enemy and increases her bonus against one favored enemy type.</p>
					<p><b>Reduced Rage (Ex) </b>: At 2nd level and every level thereafter, a hateful rager only gains 1 additional round of rage per day instead of the normal 2 additional rounds of rage per day.</p>
					<p><b>Trap Sense (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses increase by +1 every three barbarian levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level). Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.</p>
					<p><b>Feed the Rage (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a hateful rager gains 1 additional round of rage for each favored enemy she knocks unconscious or kills in combat. These current rounds of rage can only be used to add to the duration of her rage, and disappear when the rage ends. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex) </b>: At 7th level, a barbarian gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Amplified by Hate (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a hateful rager adds half her favored enemy bonus to the DC of any rage power she uses against a favored enemy. This ability replaces trap sense +3.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Rage (Ex) </b>: At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +3.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex) </b>: While in rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she also receives during her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Rage (Ex) </b>: Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Rage (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +8 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +4.</p>

							<p>A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>Of the dangerous creatures that roam grim peaks and icy steppes, giants are among the most feared. They are cunning and capricious, and their ability to craft weapons and coordinate attacks makes them a constant threat to the nomadic tribes in the region. In the wilds where giants hunt, cleverness isn&#146;t the only thing the people need to survive&#151;they require the fearlessness to confront a challenge, no matter the size.</i></p>
					<p><i>Elders select the children of the tribe&#146;s fiercest barbarians for the honor of becoming giant stalkers. Through intense training, these children learn to spot and track giants using telltale signs along with more subtle clues (such as giants&#146; unique scents). They learn the giants&#146; speech and culture; they study their traditions and brutality; and most importantly, they foster their hatred of these oversized foes.</i></p>
					<p><i>When Mammoth Lord followings travel, giant stalkers scout ahead, securing safe passage through giant-infested territories. They clear giant hunting parties and ambushes, using gruesome trophies to mark the trails. Sometimes giant hunters send their own raiding parties into the mountains to capture young giants, as most followings keep giant thralls as symbols of status.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
					<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex) </b>: A barbarian's land speed is faster than the norm for her race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when she is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because of any load carried or armor worn. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the barbarian's land speed.</p>
					<p><b>Rage (Ex) </b>: A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
					<p>While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>
					<p><b>Harangue Giant (Ex): </b>While raging, a giant stalker can speak Giant. If the giant stalker already knows Giant, she gains a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks when speaking Giant while raging.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>Smell Giants (Ex): </b>A 2nd level, a giant stalker gains the scent special ability, but with regard only to humanoids with the giant subtype.</p>
					<p><b>Giant Baiter (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a raging giant stalker can take a move action to erupt into a violent or vulgar display directed at a single giant within 60 feet. This display is infused with secret magical traditions that draw upon the Mammoth Lords&#146; ancestral enmities toward giants. A targeted giant must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half the giant stalker&#146;s barbarian level + the giant stalker&#146;s Constitution modifier) or be compelled to focus its attacks on the giant stalker; this ability can also affect non-giant creatures that are Large or larger, though such creatures gain a +4 bonus on the Will save to resist the effect. This compulsion ends if the giant stalker is out of sight or inaccessible to the giant&#146;s attacks. While baited, a giant is distracted and enraged by the insults&#151;a giant stalker gains a +1 dodge bonus to her AC against any giant she has successfully baited. Once baited, a giant remains baited for a number of rounds equal to the giant stalker&#146;s Constitution modifier, or until the giant stalker&#146;s rage ends (whichever comes first). If the giant stalker baits a different giant, any previously baited giant is no longer baited. A giant that successfully saves against baiting is immune to that giant stalker&#146;s giant baiter ability for 24 hours. This is a language-dependent mind affecting effect.</p>
					<p>At 6th level, a giant stalker can bait two giants at once, and her AC bonus against baited giants increases to +2. At 9th level, baiting giants becomes a swift action, and her AC bonus against baited giants increases to +3. At 12th level, she can bait up to three giants at once, and her AC bonus against baited giants increases to +4. At 15th level, baiting giants becomes a free action, and her AC bonus against baited giants increases to +5. At 18th level, a giant stalker can bait a number of giants equal to 3 + her Constitution modifier, and her AC bonus against baited giants increases to +6.</p>
					<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the barbarian by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels.</p>
					<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex) </b>: At 7th level, a barbarian gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Rage (Ex) </b>: At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +3.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex) </b>: While in rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she also receives during her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Rage (Ex) </b>: Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Rage (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +8 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +4.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>Geminate invokers are barbarians who use Rivethun traditions to invite spirits into their bodies. The spirits&#146; aid enables them to overcome the distractions of the flesh&#151; they can ignore pain, and even defy death. These ascetics make up much of the Rivethun martial forces.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any neutral</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
					<p><b>Contemplative (Ex): </b>A geminate invoker adds Knowledge (history), Knowledge (religion), and Linguistics to his list of class skills. Unlike most barbarians, a geminate invoker can be lawful, but must maintain a neutral element to his alignment. A geminate invoker who ceases to be neutral-aligned cannot activate his trance ability.</p>
					<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex) </b>: A barbarian's land speed is faster than the norm for her race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when she is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because of any load carried or armor worn. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the barbarian's land speed.</p>
					<p><b>Rage (Ex) </b>: A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
					<p>While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>
					<p><b>Trance (Ex) </b>: As a free action, a geminate invoker can enter a self-imposed trance, ignoring the physical limits of his body. This ability functions similarly to a barbarian&#146;s rage, except where noted below, and feats, spells, and abilities that affect a barbarian&#146;s rage (such as the Extra Rage feat) apply to an geminate invoker&#146;s trance. A geminate invoker gains rage powers as per a normal barbarian, but he can never gain totem rage powers via this ability.</p>
					<p>Instead of the normal rage bonuses and penalties, a geminate invoker in a trance gains a +4 morale bonus to his Constitution; gains a +2 morale bonus on Reflex and Will saving throws; takes no penalties to AC; can still use Dexterity-, Intelligence-, and Charisma-based skills; and gains Diehard as a bonus feat. The Constitution bonus increases to +6 and the save bonus increases to +3 when he gains greater rage, and they increase to a +8 Constitution bonus and a +4 bonus on saves when he gains mighty rage.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 2nd level, a barbarian gains the ability to react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, even if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A barbarian with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
					<p>If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
					<p><b>Haunt Channeler (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a geminate invoker gains the power to sense and absorb lingering spiritual energy. This functions identically to the medium class ability of the same name, except the geminate invoker deals 1d6 points of damage to haunts for every 3 barbarian levels he has.</p>
					<p><b>Spirit Conduit (Su): </b>At 4th level, a geminate invoker can invite a spirit into his body each time he enters a trance, gaining a lesser totem rage power for the duration of his trance. He can select a new totem each time he enters his trance, though the GM might rule that certain totem spirits are simply not available in certain locations (such as channeling a celestial totem in an evil god&#146;s temple). Invoking a totem counter to his alignment (such as a neutral good character invoking a fiend totem) requires the geminate invoker to succeed at a DC 12 Charisma check each round to dominate the spirit. Failure indicates the spirit escapes, immediately ending the trance. At 8th level, the geminate invoker gains a second totem rage power, though it must use the previously granted lesser totem rage power as a prerequisite. At 12th level, he also gains the greater totem rage power that uses the previously granted powers as prerequisites.</p>
					<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the barbarian by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels.</p>
					<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex) </b>: At 7th level, a barbarian gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Rage (Ex) </b>: At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +3.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex) </b>: While in rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she also receives during her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Rage (Ex) </b>: Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Rage (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +8 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +4.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>A flesheater eats flesh to create a spiritual bond between herself and the consumed creature, allowing her to take on aspects of the creature that served as the meal.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>
					<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d12</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
					<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex) </b>: A barbarian's land speed is faster than the norm for her race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when she is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because of any load carried or armor worn. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the barbarian's land speed.</p>
					<p><b>Rage (Ex) </b>: A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
					<p>While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>
					<p>In additional to the standard bonuses and penalties of rage, a flesheater takes a &#150;2 penalty to Intelligence while raging. The additional benefits and penalties from a flesheater&#146;s abilities last only as long as her rage does, and she cannot use these abilities if they would bring the total penalty to Intelligence to an amount equal to or greater than her Intelligence score. This ability alters the rage ability.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>One Flesh (Su): </b>At 2nd level when entering a rage, a flesheater can spend an additional round of rage and take an additional &#150;2 penalty to Intelligence to take on a single ability of the valid consumed creature whose flesh she ate most recently. For the purpose of this ability, a valid consumed creature is any dead animal, dragon, humanoid, or magical beast that died and was consumed by the flesheater within the past 24 hours. She can choose any ability listed under beast shape I, as long as the creature possessed that ability. At 5th level, the flesheater can take on any number of the creature&#146;s abilities that are listed under beast shape I. At 8th level, the flesheater can instead take on one of the creature&#146;s abilities listed under beast shape II. The flesheater&#146;s appearance alters to resemble the consumed creature, but she does not change shape. This is a polymorph effect. This ability replaces uncanny dodge, improved uncanny dodge, and the 2nd- and 8th-level rage powers.</p>
					<p><b>Trap Sense (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses increase by +1 every three barbarian levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level). Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex) </b>: At 7th level, a barbarian gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Unbound Rage (Su): </b>At 11th level, a flesheater can draw in mass from the Ethereal Plane to enlarge herself when she enters a rage, as long as the creature whose flesh she last consumed was at least one size category larger than her base size. Unbound rage affects her as enlarge person, except she receives a +4 size bonus to Strength and an additional &#150;2 penalty to Intelligence. This ability replaces greater rage.</p>
					<p><b>Feast (Su): </b>At 14th level, a flesheater can use her one flesh and unbound rage abilities to emulate any one valid consumed creature of her choice, rather than only the one she consumed most recently. This ability replaces the 14th-level rage power.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Rage (Ex) </b>: Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Unbound Form (Su): </b>At 20th level, a flesheater can use her one flesh ability to assume the shape of a valid consumed creature. This ability functions as alter self, beast shape IV, form of the dragon III, or giant form II, as appropriate. This is a polymorph effect. This ability replaces mighty rage.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>Feral gnashers grow up in the wild, either raised by animals or scraping by on their own, and soon learn to fend for themselves. These barbarians often utilize pieced-together armor and fight with their sharp teeth and whatever improvised weapons are within reach. A feral gnasher has the following class features.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<p><b>Race: </b>Goblin</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>
					<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d12</p>

					<p>Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str)</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A feral gnasher loses all martial weapon proficiencies except for greatclub and loses proficiency with medium armor.</p>
					<p><b>Savage Bite (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a feral gnasher gains a savage bite attack. This is a primary natural attack that deals 1d4 points of damage. If the goblin already has the hard head, big teeth racial trait, the damage increases to 1d6. At 10th level, the damage from a feral gnasher&#146;s bite increases to 1d6 (or 1d8 if the goblin has the hard head, big teeth racial trait) and deals &#215;3 damage on a critical hit. This ability replaces fast movement.</p>
					<p><b>Rage (Ex) </b>: A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
					<p>While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>Impromptu Armament (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a feral gnasher gains Throw Anything as a bonus feat and can pick up an unattended object that can be wielded in one hand as a free action. Additionally, the feral gnasher can take Catch Off-Guard in place of a rage power. This replaces the rage power gained at second level.</p>
					<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 2nd level, a barbarian gains the ability to react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, even if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A barbarian with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
					<p>If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
					<p><b>Lockjaw (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a feral gnasher gains the grab ability with her bite attack. A feral gnasher can use this ability on a creature up to one size category larger than she is. This replaces trap sense +1.</p>
					<p><b>Improvised Weapon Mastery (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a feral gnasher gains Improvised Weapon Mastery as a bonus feat. This replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
					<p><b>Improved Lockjaw (Ex): </b>At 6th level, as long as a feral gnasher is controlling the grapple with her lockjaw attack, she does not gain the grappled condition, but is unable to move or use her mouth for anything other than grappling. This ability replaces trap sense +2</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex) </b>: At 7th level, a barbarian gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Lockjaw (Ex): </b>At 9th level and again at 15th level, the size of a creature a feral gnasher is able to use her lockjaw&#146;s grab ability on increases by one size increment. This ability replaces trap sense +3 and trap sense +5.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Rage (Ex) </b>: At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +3.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex) </b>: While in rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she also receives during her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Wicked Improvisation (Ex): </b>At 12th level, a feral gnasher becomes more capable with improvised weapons and natural attacks. The feral gnasher gains a +1 competence bonus on damage rolls when using natural attacks or improvised weapons while raging. At 14th level and every two levels thereafter, the damage bonus increases by +1. This increase is not precision damage and is thus multiplied on a critical hit. This ability replaces trap sense +4.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Rage (Ex) </b>: Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Rage (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +8 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +4.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>Dark overlords frequently recruit their most bloodthirsty followers to serve as brutal bodyguards. These savage slaves feel little pain and exist only to rain terror down on the enemies of their pitiless masters.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
					<p><b>Intractable (Ex) </b>: A combination of brainwashing and loyalty helps a fearsome defender resist pain and torture, enduring grueling combat or questioning without betraying her dark lord. A fearsome defender gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against painUM effects, and the DCs of checks to coerce her or demoralize her with Diplomacy or Intimidate increase by 2. Both the bonus and the increase to DCs increase by 2 when she gains greater rage and again by 2 when she gains mighty rage.</p>
					<p><b>Rage (Ex) </b>: A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
					<p>While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>Off the Leash (Ex): </b>Beginning at 2nd level, a fearsome defender simmers on the edge of bloody combat. Whenever she begins a rage, she can also draw an unconcealed weapon as part of the free action to begin raging.</p>
					<p>This ability replaces uncanny dodge.</p>
					<p><b>Silent Threat (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a fearsome defender exudes hostility, creating a threatening atmosphere in her presence. The fearsome defender gains a +1 bonus on Intimidate checks, and the DCs of Intimidate checks to demoralize her allies within 30 feet increase by 1. Both the bonus and the increase to DCs increase by 1 at 6th level and every 3 barbarian levels thereafter.</p>
					<p>This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
					<p><b>Bloodlust (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a fearsome defender&#146;s eagerness for bloodshed makes her quicker to act in a fight. She adds her Charisma modifier to initiative checks and always acts during the surprise round. If the fearsome defender is surprised during the surprise round, she acts last in that round and then determines initiative order normally for the remainder of combat.</p>
					<p>This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex) </b>: At 7th level, a barbarian gains damage reduction.

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>Some barbarian tribes have strong ties to the elemental forces of nature. Their shamans anoint the warriors at birth, tying them to the patron element of the tribe and granting them lasting boons against such forces. An elemental kin has the following class feature.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>

A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 2nd level, a barbarian gains the ability to react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, even if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A barbarian with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
					<p>If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
					<p><b>Elemental Fury (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, whenever the elemental kin takes an amount of energy damage equal to or greater than her barbarian level while raging, she adds 1 to the total number of rounds that she can rage that day. At 6th level, and every three levels thereafter, the number of extra rounds per energy attack increases by +1, to a maximum of +6 rounds per energy attack at at 18th level. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
					<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the barbarian by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels.</p>
					<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex) </b>: At 7th level, a barbarian gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Rage (Ex) </b>: At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +3.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex) </b>: While in rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she also receives during her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Rage (Ex) </b>: Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Rage (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +8 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +4.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>These hotheaded, hard-drinking ruffians and brawlers are as dangerous in the midst of combat as they are in a tavern, and they wouldn&#146;t be caught dead without a libation for either occasion.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>

This benefit applies only when she is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because of any load carried or armor worn. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the barbarian's land speed.</p>
					<p><b>Drunken Rage (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a drunken rager can drink a unit of ale or other strong alcohol while raging to gain 1 drunken rage point. The act of drinking is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. At 1st level, the barbarian can have a maximum of 1 drunken rage point; this maximum increases by 1 every 2 levels thereafter. These drunken rage points last for 1 hour or until spent, whichever comes first. The barbarian can use drunken rage points only while raging. Unless otherwise noted, spending a drunken rage point is a free action.</p>
					<p>A drunken rager can spend 1 drunken rage point to increase her movement speed by 20 feet for 1 round, provided she is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor and is not carrying a heavy load. She can also spend 1 drunken rage point to gain 1 additional round of her rage class feature, which lasts for 1 hour or until used. This ability replaces fast movement.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>Staggering Evasion (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, as long as she has at least 1 drunken rage point, a drunken rager gains evasion, as the rogue class feature of the same name. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.</p>
					<p><b>Tolerance (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, as long as she has at least 1 drunken rage point, a drunken rager gains a +1 bonus on saves against effects that would nauseate, poison, or sicken her, as well as saves to avoid addiction or other ill effects associated with consuming alcohol. This bonus increases by 1 at 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
					<p><b>Improved Staggering Evasion (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, as long as she has at least 2 drunken rage points, a drunken rager gains improved evasion, as the rogue advanced talent of the same name. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex) </b>: At 7th level, a barbarian gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Rage (Ex) </b>: At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +3.</p>
					<p><b>Drunken Swing (Ex): </b>At 12th level, a drunken rager can spend 1 drunken rage point as a swift action before making a melee attack to drastically increase the deadliness of her attack. The critical threat range of her next attack that round increases by 1 (for example, a critical threat range of 20 would increase to 19&#150;20). This ability does not stack with any other effect that expands the critical threat range of a weapon. At 16th level and again at 20th level, the barbarian can spend 1 additional drunken rage point to further increase the critical threat range of her next attack (to a maximum critical threat range increase of 3 at 20th level). This ability replaces the rage power gained at 12th level.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex) </b>: While in rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she also receives during her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Rage (Ex) </b>: Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Rage (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +8 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +4.</p>

							<p>While raging, the drunken brute can drink a potion, or a tankard of ale or similar quantity of alcohol, as a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A potion has its normal effect, while an alcoholic drink allows the barbarian to maintain her rage that round without expending a round of rage for the day (instead of the alcohol&#146;s normal effects). For each alcoholic drink consumed while raging, the barbarian is nauseated for 1 round when her rage expires, in addition to the normal fatigue that follows a rage. Tireless rage does not negate this nauseated condition but the internal fortitude rage power does. This ability replaces fast movement.</p>

							<p>A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>Barbarians are known for their ability to consume potent drink, but drunken brutes turn drinking into a combat tactic, using the potent liquor to fuel their rage and grant them additional powers. A drunken brute has the following class feature.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
					<p><b>Rage (Ex) </b>: A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
					<p>While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>
					<p><b>Raging Drunk (Ex): </b>While raging, the drunken brute can drink a potion, or a tankard of ale or similar quantity of alcohol, as a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A potion has its normal effect, while an alcoholic drink allows the barbarian to maintain her rage that round without expending a round of rage for the day (instead of the alcohol&#146;s normal effects). For each alcoholic drink consumed while raging, the barbarian is nauseated for 1 round when her rage expires, in addition to the normal fatigue that follows a rage. Tireless rage does not negate this nauseated condition but the internal fortitude rage power does. This ability replaces fast movement.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 2nd level, a barbarian gains the ability to react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, even if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A barbarian with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
					<p>If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
					<p><b>Trap Sense (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses increase by +1 every three barbarian levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level). Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.</p>
					<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the barbarian by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels.</p>
					<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex) </b>: At 7th level, a barbarian gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Rage (Ex) </b>: At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +3.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex) </b>: While in rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she also receives during her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Rage (Ex) </b>: Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Rage (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +8 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +4.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>Unstoppable and fearless, the dreadnought turns the terror of her enemies into violent physical power.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
					<p><b>Rage (Ex) </b>: A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
					<p>While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>
					<p><b>Dead Calm (Ex): </b>A dreadnought can enter a dispassionate killing spree as a free action, granting her additional combat prowess. The dreadnought gains only half the usual bonuses from her rage but takes no penalty to her AC, can use all her normal skills and effects that require concentration, and is not fatigued when her rage ends. The dreadnought cannot enter a rage for 1 minute after she ends her rage, and she cannot charge or run while under the effects of her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Stead Gait (Ex): </b>A dreadnought advances steadily, shrugging off attempts to slow her advance. The dreadnought gains a +1 bonus on saving throws and to her CMD against effects that would slow or immobilize her. This bonus increases to +2 when she gains greater rage and +3 when she gains mighty rage.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 2nd level, a barbarian gains the ability to react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, even if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A barbarian with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
					<p>If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
					<p><b>Trap Sense (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses increase by +1 every three barbarian levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level). Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.</p>
					<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the barbarian by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels.</p>
					<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex) </b>: At 7th level, a barbarian gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Rage (Ex) </b>: At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +3.</p>
					<p><b>Fearless Killer (Su): </b>Starting at 14th level, a dreadnought becomes implacable in her pursuit of slaughter. While in rage, she is immune to fear effects.</p>
					<p><b>Instant Dispassion (Ex): </b>At 17th level, a dreadnought can quickly turn her compassion on and off. She can enter a rage as soon as she wants after ending a previous rage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Rage (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +8 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +4.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>Deepwater ragers bellow ferociously as they charge their enemies, tackling them into the raging seas. This archetype is compatible with both barbarians and unchained barbarians (Pathfinder RPG Pathfinder Unchained).</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
					<p><b>Strong Lungs (Ex): </b>A deepwater rager can hold her breath for a number of rounds equal to four times her Constitution score, and she does not reduce the duration of her held breath by taking a standard action or a full-round action. Additionally, as long as she is able to speak, the deepwater rager adds her Constitution modifier to Intimidate skill checks in addition to her Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p><b>Rage (Ex) </b>: A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
					<p>While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>Spiraling Charge (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a deepwater rager is not required to move in a straight line when she charges, provided that no space she moves into while charging is farther away from her target than the space that she is leaving. The deepwater rager must be able to see her target at the beginning of her charge and cannot use this ability while mounted.</p>
					<p><b>Trap Sense (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses increase by +1 every three barbarian levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level). Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.</p>
					<p><b>Disorienting Grapple (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a deepwater rager becomes an expert in flipping and spinning opponents as they are grappled. An opponent grappled by the deepwater rager gains the sickened condition for as long as it has the grappled condition. When the creature&#146;s grappled condition ends, for any reason, it must succeed at an Acrobatics check (with a DC equal to the deepwater rager&#146;s CMD) or fall prone.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex) </b>: At 7th level, a barbarian gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Rage (Ex) </b>: At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +3.</p>
					<p><b>Crushing Grapple (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a deepwater rager gains the constrict special attack (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 298), which deals an amount of damage equal to the damage her unarmed strike deals.</p>
					<p><b>Full Lungs (Ex) </b>: At 17th level, a deepwater rager does not need to breathe while she is raging.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Rage (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +8 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +4.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>Unused to the light of the sun, cave dwellers use their subterranean expertise to protect their clans from the manifold dangers of deep caverns and tunnels. The typical cave dweller is perfectly content to live his entire life underground, and he may even view the light of the sun as particularly abhorrent or taboo. While this lifestyle doesn&#146;t in and of itself imply evil or sinister intent, many outlanders ignorantly assume that cave dwellers avoid the light of the sun for malicious reasons. In truth, cave dwellers are as capable of goodness and kindness as any other&#151;they just see little reason to venture out of their preferred homelands. When a cave dweller joins an adventuring party, she may retain an inherent nervousness about sleeping under the open sky and may long for the familiar confines of a comforting cavern, but this rarely translates directly into a notable disadvantage. Indeed, many adventuring groups come to value the specialized talents and skills the cave dweller brings to the party.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
					<p><b>Tight Tunnels (Ex): </b>Cave dwellers pursue prey through the winding tunnels of the deep, which rarely accommodate open sprints. A cave dweller can make a single turn up to 90 degrees while running (though not while charging). Additionally, a cave dweller takes no penalties to movement speed while squeezing.</p>
					<p><b>Rage (Ex) </b>: A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
					<p>While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 2nd level, a barbarian gains the ability to react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, even if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A barbarian with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
					<p>If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
					<p><b>Tunnel Vision (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a cave dweller&#146;s senses become sharp in the dark. She gains darkvision to a range of 60 feet and a +1 bonus on Perception checks to detect ambushes, movement, and sound while in darkness. This bonus increases by 1 at 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter.</p>
					<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the barbarian by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels.</p>
					<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
					<p><b>Sun Walker (Ex) </b>: At 7th level, a cave dweller gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC and on saving throws against effects with the light descriptor or that produce bright or sudden light. Any penalties on attack rolls, saving throws, or skill checks because of bright light are reduced by 1. At 10th level and every 3 levels after 10th, the bonus to AC and saving throws, as well as the reduction of light-based penalties, increases by 1.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Rage (Ex) </b>: At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +3.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex) </b>: While in rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she also receives during her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Rage (Ex) </b>: Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Rage (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +8 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +4.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>Some barbarians focus on using their bare hands to tear their opponents limb from limb. These brutal pugilists also learn a great deal about various combat maneuvers, using them to cripple or crush their foes.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
					<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex) </b>: A barbarian's land speed is faster than the norm for her race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when she is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because of any load carried or armor worn. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the barbarian's land speed.</p>
					<p><b>Rage (Ex) </b>: A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
					<p>While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>Savage Grapple (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, the brutal pugilist takes only half the normal penalties to Dexterity, attack rolls, and combat maneuver checks when she has the grappled condition. She can make an attack of opportunity against creatures trying to grapple her even if they possess the Improved Grapple feat or the grab special attack. If she hits with this attack of opportunity, she gains a +2 circumstance bonus to her CMD against the grapple attempt. She cannot make these attacks of opportunity once a grapple has succeeded.</p>
					<p><b>Pit Fighter (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, the brutal pugilist has learned combat tricks from fighting in pit brawls and gladiatorial arenas. She selects one combat maneuver and gains a +1 insight bonus on her CMB or to her CMD in that maneuver. This bonus increases to +2 if the barbarian is wearing no armor (shields are allowed). At every three levels after 3rd, the barbarian may select another combat maneuver and add this bonus on her CMB or to her CMD. This bonus can be applied to each maneuver no more than twice, once on CMB and once to CMD.</p>
					<p><b>Improved Savage Grapple (Ex): </b>At 5th level, the brutal pugilist takes no penalties to Dexterity, attack rolls, and combat maneuver checks when she has the grappled condition. She also is treated as one size larger than her actual size when determining whether she can be grappled using the grab ability or swallowed by another creature</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex) </b>: At 7th level, a barbarian gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Rage (Ex) </b>: At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +3.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex) </b>: While in rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she also receives during her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Rage (Ex) </b>: Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Rage (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +8 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +4.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>The hardy and insular denizens of the swamp produce warriors of narrow focus and great strength. The prejudice and misunderstanding with which civilized folk often regard barbarians is often even more pronounced in the case of these belligerent outcasts from society, in large part due to the fact that brutish swampers deliberately mock and antagonize the so-called &#147;city folk.&#148; To a brutish swamper, an urban lifestyle is one that breeds weakness and lassitude in the body. The brutish swamper has little interest or patience in maintaining alliances or friendship with those who live such soft lifestyles, and this aggression only further encourages feelings of prejudice on both sides of the cultural divide. When a brutish swamper joins an adventuring party, they usually come to value the skills and talents of their more urbanized companions, but never fully understand the desire to live lives surrounded by creature comforts.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
					<p><b>Marsh March (Ex): </b>A brutish swamper can move through the underbrush and muddy terrain of bogs and swamps at her normal speed without taking damage or suffering other impairments. Briars, mud, thorns, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
					<p><b>Rage (Ex) </b>: A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
					<p>While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>Home (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a brutish swamper gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks when in swamps. This bonus increases by +1 at 5th level and again every 3 levels after 5th (up to a maximum bonus of +8 at 20th level).</p>
					<p><b>Stubborn (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a brutish swamper resists any attempts to change her attitude or compel her to action. Diplomacy and Intimidate checks against her take a &#150;2 penalty, and no result can shift her attitude more than one step in a 24-hour period. These penalties increase by 2 for every 3 levels the brutish swamper has beyond 3rd.</p>
					<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the barbarian by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels.</p>
					<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
					<p><b>Wrastlin&#146; (Ex): </b>At 6th level, while raging, a brutish swamper gains a +2 bonus to her CMD against grapple combat maneuvers and a +2 bonus on damage rolls made as part of successful grapple combat maneuver checks.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex) </b>: At 7th level, a barbarian gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Rage (Ex) </b>: At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +3.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex) </b>: While in rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she also receives during her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Rage (Ex) </b>: Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Rage (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +8 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +4.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>While most barbarians are skilled at breaking things, some find the need to destroy their surroundings an almost uncontrollable urge when in the middle of a rage. These barbarians are a danger not only to their foes, but also to the very environment around them. A breaker barbarian has the following class features.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>
					<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d12</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
					<p><b>Destructive (Ex): </b>Whenever the breaker barbarian makes a melee attack that targets an unattended object or makes a sunder combat maneuver, she adds half her barbarian level (minimum +1) on the damage roll. This ability replaces fast movement.</p>
					<p><b>Rage (Ex) </b>: A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
					<p>While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 2nd level, a barbarian gains the ability to react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, even if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A barbarian with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
					<p>If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
					<p><b>Battle Scavenger (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, the breaker barbarian suffers no penalty on attack rolls when using an improvised weapon or a weapon with the broken condition. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on damage rolls with improvised or broken weapons for every three levels beyond 3rd. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
					<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the barbarian by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels.</p>
					<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex) </b>: At 7th level, a barbarian gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Rage (Ex) </b>: At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +3.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex) </b>: While in rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she also receives during her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Rage (Ex) </b>: Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Rage (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +8 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +4.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>While some barbarians take on bestial aspects in their rages, the beastkin berserker descends so deeply into primal fury that she actually transforms into an animal. Berserkers of the surface world often associate with predators such as bears or wolves, and are sometimes mistaken for lycanthropes. The barbarians in Deep Tolguth shapechange into rampaging dinosaurs or megafauna, crafting their armor out of the hide and bones of their favored animals.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
					<p><b>Savage Rapport (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a beastkin berserker gains a spiritual connection to a specific kind of creature with the animal type (such as a badger or a triceratops). She adds half her level (minimum 1) on Handle Animal, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks involving the chosen type of animal.</p>
					<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th levels), the beastkin berserker can select an additional kind of animal to which these bonuses apply.</p>
					<p><b>Rage (Ex) </b>: A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
					<p>While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 2nd level, a barbarian gains the ability to react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, even if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A barbarian with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>
					<p>If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
					<p><b>Trap Sense (Ex) </b>: At 3rd level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses increase by +1 every three barbarian levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level). Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.</p>
					<p><b>Feral Transformation (Su): </b>At 4th level, when entering a rage, a beastkin berserker can take the form of a Small or Medium animal. This functions as beast shape I, except the duration is for as long as the beastkin berserker rages and the animal must be one she has chosen with her savage rapport.</p>
					<p>At 8th level, the beastkin berserker can use feral transformation to take the form of a Large or Tiny animal that she has chosen with her savage rapport. Feral transformation now acts as beast shape II.</p>
					<p>At 12th level, a beastkin berserker is able to use feral transformation to take the form of a Huge or Diminutive animal that she has chosen with her savage rapport. Feral transformation now functions as beast shape III.</p>
					<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the barbarian by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels.</p>
					<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex) </b>: At 7th level, a barbarian gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Rage (Ex) </b>: At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +3.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex) </b>: While in rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she also receives during her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Rage (Ex) </b>: Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Rage (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +8 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +4.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>Some barbarians disdain the hides and leather used as armor by most of their kin. Instead they master the heaviest of armors, even those created by more civilized people, to gain greater protection and stability in battle.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors-they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>
					<p><b>Role </b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment </b>: Any nonlawful.</p>
					<h>Ex-Barbarians</h>
					<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other benefits of the class.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>: A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Stance (Ex): </b>An armored hulk gains a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks and to CMD for overrun combat maneuvers, and on Reflex saves against trample attacks. She also gains a +1 bonus to her AC against charge attacks and on attack and damage rolls against charging creatures. This ability replaces fast movement.</p>
					<p><b>Rage (Ex) </b>: A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like <i>bear's endurance </i>, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
					<p>While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.</p>
					<p><b>Rage Powers (Ex) </b>: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>
					<p><b>Armored Swiftness (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, an armored hulk moves faster in medium and heavy armor. When wearing medium or heavy armor, an armored hulk can move 5 feet faster than normal, to a maximum of her speed. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.</p>
					<p><b>Resilience of Steel (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, an armored hulk is able to use her armor to help avoid deadly hits. While wearing heavy armor, she gains a +1 bonus to AC that applies only on critical hit confirmation rolls. This bonus increases by +1 every 3 levels beyond 3rd (maximum +6 at 18th level). This ability replaces trap sense.</p>
					<p><b>Improved Armored Swiftness (Ex): </b>At 5th level, an armored hulk&#146;s land speed is faster than the norm for her race by +10 feet. This benefit applies when she is wearing any armor, including heavy armor, but not while carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the armored hulk&#146;s speed because of any load carried or armor worn. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the barbarian&#146;s land speed. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex) </b>: At 7th level, a barbarian gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Rage (Ex) </b>: At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +3.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex) </b>: While in rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she also receives during her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Rage (Ex) </b>: Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Rage (Ex) </b>: At 20th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +8 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +4.</p>
