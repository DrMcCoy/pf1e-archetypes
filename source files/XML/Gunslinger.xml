					<p>At 1st level, a gunslinger gains one of the following firearms of her choice: blunderbuss, musket, or pistol. Her starting weapon is battered, and only she knows how to use it properly. All other creatures treat her gun as if it had the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it does not work at all for anyone else trying to use it. This starting weapon can only be sold for scrap (it's worth 4d10 gp when sold). The gunslinger also gains Gunsmithing as a bonus feat.</p>

					<p>A gunslinger makes her mark upon the world with daring deeds. Some gunslingers claim they belong to a mystical way of the gun, but it's more likely that the volatile nature of firearms simply prunes the unlucky and careless from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all gunslingers have grit. In game terms, grit is a fluctuating measure of a gunslinger's ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a gunslinger gains a number of grit points equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Her grit goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), though some feats and magic items may affect this maximum. A gunslinger spends grit to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains grit in the following ways.</p>
					<p><i>Critical Hit with a Firearm: </i>Each time the gunslinger confirms a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level does not restore grit.</p>
					<p><i>Killing Blow with a Firearm: </i>When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.</p>

					<p>Gunslingers spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.</p>
					<p>A planar rifter gains the following deeds.</p>
					<p>Infused Bullet (Su): At 1st level, a planar rifter&#146;s bullets carry the essence of a plane to which his grit pool is attuned, striking true against creatures that shrink from that plane&#146;s nature. As long as he has at least 1 point in his grit pool, he gains the following benefits: if he infuses his bullets with an alignment, his bullet&#146;s damage counts as that alignment for the purposes of overcoming DR; if he infuses his bullets with an element, half of his bullet&#146;s damage changes to an energy type determined by the element infused: acid (earth), cold (water), electricity (air), or fire (fire).</p>
					<p>Planar Surge (Su): At 7th level, a planar rifter can spend 1 grit point as a swift action to change the attunement of his grit pool to any alignment or element. This new attunement remains for 1 minute, after which time the grit pool becomes unattuned.</p>
					<p>Breaching Shot (Su): At 15th level, a planar rifter can fire bullets with such precision that he tears temporary rifts between planes. As a standard action, he can spend 3 grit points to shoot at a location within his firearm&#146;s first range increment and tear a 10-foot-radius portal to a plane of his choice. The rift leads to a random location on the plane that is between 5 and 500 miles from his intended destination, as plane shift. The rift remains open for 1 minute, during which time any number of willing creatures can pass through. It is a one-way rift, and it is insufficiently stable to reveal details about the environment on the other side.</p>
					<p>Banishing Shot (Su): At 19th level, whenever a planar rifter confirms a critical hit against an extraplanar target, he can spend 1 grit to deal normal damage, and the target must succeed at a Will saving throw with a DC equal to 20 + the planar rifter&#146;s Wisdom modifier. On a failed saving throw, the target is returned to its original plane as per the banishment spell.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Followers of the daemonic harbinger Cixyron invented a method of harvesting pieces from Abaddon, absorbing some of the energy into themselves and condensing other portions of it into bullets they could fire from their guns. While these methods originated among Cixyron&#146;s followers, they have spread among a few other seasoned planar travelers. Not all planar rifters are evil, as the same methods that proved effective in slaying the celestial host are just as useful against other planar forces.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For a renegade few, battle sounds different than it does for the typical fighter. The clash of steel and the sizzle of spell energy are drowned out by the thunderous rhythm of gunfire&#151;the pounding beat of the gunslinger.</p>
			<p>Gunslingers are a bold and mysterious lot. While many treat the secrets of black powder with the same care and reverence that a wizard typically reserves for his spellbook, most gunslingers know that firearms are a secret that cannot remain concealed forever. While current firearms are simple, often imprecise, and even dangerous devices, they are a technology on the move, and one that will become even more powerful when it is fully fused with magic.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Gunslingers are thunderous artillery, often found where the fighting is fiercest. Brave, clever, and frequently foolhardy, many gunslingers push to position themselves at close range, barrels blazing, to take down their foes and demoralize their enemies. Other gunslingers are masters of distant death, picking off enemies from afar with their strange and wondrous weapons.</p>

			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Gunslingers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with all firearms. They are proficient with all light armor.</p>
			<p><b>Gunsmith: </b>At 1st level, a gunslinger gains one of the following firearms of her choice: blunderbuss, musket, or pistol. Her starting weapon is battered, and only she knows how to use it properly. All other creatures treat her gun as if it had the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it does not work at all for anyone else trying to use it. This starting weapon can only be sold for scrap (it's worth 4d10 gp when sold). The gunslinger also gains Gunsmithing as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Grit (Ex): </b>A gunslinger makes her mark upon the world with daring deeds. Some gunslingers claim they belong to a mystical way of the gun, but it's more likely that the volatile nature of firearms simply prunes the unlucky and careless from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all gunslingers have grit. In game terms, grit is a fluctuating measure of a gunslinger's ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a gunslinger gains a number of grit points equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Her grit goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), though some feats and magic items may affect this maximum. A gunslinger spends grit to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains grit in the following ways.</p>
			<p><b>Critical Hit with a Firearm: </b>Each time the gunslinger confirms a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level does not restore grit.</p>
			<p><b>Killing Blow with a Firearm: </b>When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.</p>
			<p><b>Deeds: </b>Gunslingers spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.</p>
			<p>A planar rifter gains the following deeds.</p>
			<p><i>Infused Bullet (Su): </i>At 1st level, a planar rifter&#146;s bullets carry the essence of a plane to which his grit pool is attuned, striking true against creatures that shrink from that plane&#146;s nature. As long as he has at least 1 point in his grit pool, he gains the following benefits: if he infuses his bullets with an alignment, his bullet&#146;s damage counts as that alignment for the purposes of overcoming DR; if he infuses his bullets with an element, half of his bullet&#146;s damage changes to an energy type determined by the element infused: acid (earth), cold (water), electricity (air), or fire (fire).</p>
			<p><i>Planar Surge (Su): </i>At 7th level, a planar rifter can spend 1 grit point as a swift action to change the attunement of his grit pool to any alignment or element. This new attunement remains for 1 minute, after which time the grit pool becomes unattuned.</p>
			<p><i>Breaching Shot (Su): </i>At 15th level, a planar rifter can fire bullets with such precision that he tears temporary rifts between planes. As a standard action, he can spend 3 grit points to shoot at a location within his firearm&#146;s first range increment and tear a 10-foot-radius portal to a plane of his choice. The rift leads to a random location on the plane that is between 5 and 500 miles from his intended destination, as plane shift. The rift remains open for 1 minute, during which time any number of willing creatures can pass through. It is a one-way rift, and it is insufficiently stable to reveal details about the environment on the other side.</p>
			<p><i>Banishing Shot (Su): </i>At 19th level, whenever a planar rifter confirms a critical hit against an extraplanar target, he can spend 1 grit to deal normal damage, and the target must succeed at a Will saving throw with a DC equal to 20 + the planar rifter&#146;s Wisdom modifier. On a failed saving throw, the target is returned to its original plane as per the banishment spell.</p>
			<p><b>Planar Resistance (Su): </b>At 2nd level, when a planar rifter infuses his grit with the essence of a plane, he gains protection against that plane&#146;s dangers. If he attunes his grit pool to chaos, good, evil, or law, he gains resistance to magical effects that deal damage based on the chosen alignment, such as holy smite, order&#146;s wrath, a paladin&#146;s smite evil attack, or an unholy weapon. If he attunes his grit pool to air, earth, fire, or water, he gains protection against the energy type associated with that element (see infused bullet). He reduces the amount of damage taken from attacks of the chosen type by 2 points per gunslinger level.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feats: </b>At 4th level, and every four levels thereafter, a gunslinger gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained by normal advancement. These bonus feats must be combat or grit feats.</p>
			<p><b>Planar Strike (Su): </b>At 5th level, as long as he has at least 1 point in his grit pool, a planar rifter&#146;s weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 points of damage of the same damage type reduced by his planar resistance. Aligned damage harms only creatures of an opposed alignment. At 13th level, this damage increases to 2d6.</p>
			<p><b>True Grit (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a gunslinger picks two deeds that she has access to and that she must spend grit to perform. She can perform these deeds for 1 grit point fewer (minimum 0) than usual. If the number of grit points to perform a deed is reduced to 0, the gunslinger can perform this deed as long as she has at least 1 grit point. If a deed could already be performed as long as she had at least 1 grit point, she can now perform that deed even when she has no grit points.</p>

					<p>A pistolero swaps a trio of deeds for the following.</p>
					<p>Up Close and Deadly (Ex): At 1st level, when the pistolero hits a target with a one-handed firearm that is not making a scatter shot, she can spend 1 grit point to deal 1d6 points of extra damage on a hit.

This precision damage increases to 2d6 at 5th level, to 3d6 at 10th level, to 4d6 at 15th level, and to 5d6 at 20th level. This precision damage stacks with sneak attack and other forms of precision damage. The cost of using this deed cannot be reduced with the Signature Deed feat, the true grit class feature, or any similar effect. This deed replaces the deadeye deed.</p>
					<p>Deadeye (Ex): At 7th level, the pistolero gains the deadeye deed, which is normally a 1st-level gunslinger deed. This deed replaces the startling shot deed.</p>
					<p>Twin Shot Knockdown (Ex): At 11th level, when the pistolero hits a single target with two or more one-handed firearm attacks during her turn, she can spend 1 grit point to knock the target prone. She can choose to spend the grit point after the attacks are made. This deed replaces the bleeding wound deed.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>While most gunslingers have favorite firearms, there are those rare ones who choose to specialize in one-handed firearms exclusively. These gunslingers are called pistoleros. While they lack the flexibility of being able to pick up any kind of firearm and use it with reasonable proficiency, they are crackerjack shots with pistols and similar firearms. Their skill and aim with these firearms at close range is second to none, and they rarely misfire with these weapons.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For a renegade few, battle sounds different than it does for the typical fighter. The clash of steel and the sizzle of spell energy are drowned out by the thunderous rhythm of gunfire&#151;the pounding beat of the gunslinger.</p>
			<p>Gunslingers are a bold and mysterious lot. While many treat the secrets of black powder with the same care and reverence that a wizard typically reserves for his spellbook, most gunslingers know that firearms are a secret that cannot remain concealed forever. While current firearms are simple, often imprecise, and even dangerous devices, they are a technology on the move, and one that will become even more powerful when it is fully fused with magic.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Gunslingers are thunderous artillery, often found where the fighting is fiercest. Brave, clever, and frequently foolhardy, many gunslingers push to position themselves at close range, barrels blazing, to take down their foes and demoralize their enemies. Other gunslingers are masters of distant death, picking off enemies from afar with their strange and wondrous weapons.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Gunslinger's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A pistolero only gains proficiency with one-handed firearms. She must take Exotic Weapon Proficiency (firearm) to gain proficiency with two-handed firearms and firearm siege engines. . Gunslingers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons. They are proficient with all light armor.</p>
			<p><b>Gunsmith: </b>A pistolero must take a pistol when she chooses a battered firearm at 1st level. Her starting weapon is battered, and only she knows how to use it properly. All other creatures treat her gun as if it had the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it does not work at all for anyone else trying to use it. This starting weapon can only be sold for scrap (it's worth 4d10 gp when sold). The gunslinger also gains Gunsmithing as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Grit (Ex): </b>A gunslinger makes her mark upon the world with daring deeds. Some gunslingers claim they belong to a mystical way of the gun, but it's more likely that the volatile nature of firearms simply prunes the unlucky and careless from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all gunslingers have grit. In game terms, grit is a fluctuating measure of a gunslinger's ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a gunslinger gains a number of grit points equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Her grit goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), though some feats and magic items may affect this maximum. A gunslinger spends grit to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains grit in the following ways.</p>
			<p><b>Critical Hit with a Firearm: </b>Each time the gunslinger confirms a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level does not restore grit.</p>
			<p><b>Killing Blow with a Firearm: </b>When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.</p>
			<p><b>Deeds: </b>Gunslingers spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.</p>
			<p>A pistolero swaps a trio of deeds for the following.</p>
			<p><i>Up Close and Deadly (Ex): </i>At 1st level, when the pistolero hits a target with a one-handed firearm that is not making a scatter shot, she can spend 1 grit point to deal 1d6 points of extra damage on a hit. If she misses with the attack, she grazes the target, dealing half the extra damage anyway. This is precision damage and is not multiplied if the attack is a critical hit. This precision damage increases to 2d6 at 5th level, to 3d6 at 10th level, to 4d6 at 15th level, and to 5d6 at 20th level. This precision damage stacks with sneak attack and other forms of precision damage. The cost of using this deed cannot be reduced with the Signature Deed feat, the true grit class feature, or any similar effect. This deed replaces the deadeye deed.</p>
			<p><i>Deadeye (Ex): </i>At 7th level, the pistolero gains the deadeye deed, which is normally a 1st-level gunslinger deed. This deed replaces the startling shot deed.</p>
			<p><i>Twin Shot Knockdown (Ex): </i>At 11th level, when the pistolero hits a single target with two or more one-handed firearm attacks during her turn, she can spend 1 grit point to knock the target prone. She can choose to spend the grit point after the attacks are made. This deed replaces the bleeding wound deed.</p>
			<p><b>Nimble (Ex): </b>Starting at 2nd level, a gunslinger gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC while wearing light or no armor. Anything that causes the gunslinger to lose her Dexterity bonus to AC also causes the gunslinger to lose this dodge bonus. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd level (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level).</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feats: </b>At 4th level, and every four levels thereafter, a gunslinger gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained by normal advancement. These bonus feats must be combat or grit feats.</p>
			<p><b>Pistol Training (Ex): </b>Starting at 5th level, a pistolero increases her skill with one-handed firearms. She gains a bonus on damage rolls equal to her Dexterity modifier, and when she misfires with a one-handed firearm, the misfire value increases by 2 instead of 4. Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), the bonus on damage rolls increases by +1. This ability replaces gun training 1 to 4.</p>
			<p><b>True Grit (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a gunslinger picks two deeds that she has access to and that she must spend grit to perform. She can perform these deeds for 1 grit point fewer (minimum 0) than usual. If the number of grit points to perform a deed is reduced to 0, the gunslinger can perform this deed as long as she has at least 1 grit point. If a deed could already be performed as long as she had at least 1 grit point, she can now perform that deed even when she has no grit points.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>-</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For a renegade few, battle sounds different than it does for the typical fighter. The clash of steel and the sizzle of spell energy are drowned out by the thunderous rhythm of gunfire&#151;the pounding beat of the gunslinger.</p>
			<p>Gunslingers are a bold and mysterious lot. While many treat the secrets of black powder with the same care and reverence that a wizard typically reserves for his spellbook, most gunslingers know that firearms are a secret that cannot remain concealed forever. While current firearms are simple, often imprecise, and even dangerous devices, they are a technology on the move, and one that will become even more powerful when it is fully fused with magic.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Gunslingers are thunderous artillery, often found where the fighting is fiercest. Brave, clever, and frequently foolhardy, many gunslingers push to position themselves at close range, barrels blazing, to take down their foes and demoralize their enemies. Other gunslingers are masters of distant death, picking off enemies from afar with their strange and wondrous weapons.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Gunslinger's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Gunslingers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with all firearms. They are proficient with all light armor.</p>
			<p><b>Gunsmith: </b>At 1st level, a gunslinger gains one of the following firearms of her choice: blunderbuss, musket, or pistol. Her starting weapon is battered, and only she knows how to use it properly. All other creatures treat her gun as if it had the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it does not work at all for anyone else trying to use it. This starting weapon can only be sold for scrap (it's worth 4d10 gp when sold). The gunslinger also gains Gunsmithing as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Grit (Ex): </b>A gunslinger makes her mark upon the world with daring deeds. Some gunslingers claim they belong to a mystical way of the gun, but it's more likely that the volatile nature of firearms simply prunes the unlucky and careless from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all gunslingers have grit. In game terms, grit is a fluctuating measure of a gunslinger's ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a gunslinger gains a number of grit points equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Her grit goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), though some feats and magic items may affect this maximum. A gunslinger spends grit to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains grit in the following ways.</p>
			<p><i>Critical Hit with a Firearm: </i>Each time the gunslinger confirms a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level does not restore grit.</p>
			<p><i>Killing Blow with a Firearm: </i>When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.</p>
			<p><b>Deeds: </b>Gunslingers spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.</p>
			<p><b>Nimble (Ex): </b>Starting at 2nd level, a gunslinger gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC while wearing light or no armor. Anything that causes the gunslinger to lose her Dexterity bonus to AC also causes the gunslinger to lose this dodge bonus. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd level (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level).</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feats: </b>At 4th level, and every four levels thereafter, a gunslinger gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained by normal advancement. These bonus feats must be combat or grit feats.</p>
			<p><b>Gun Training (Ex): </b>Starting at 5th level, a gunslinger can select one specific type of firearm (such as an axe musket, blunderbuss, musket, or pistol). She gains a bonus equal to her Dexterity modifier on damage rolls when firing that type of firearm. Furthermore, when she misfires with that type of firearm, the misfire value of that firearm increases by 2 instead of 4.</p>
			<p>Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), the gunslinger picks up another type of firearm, gaining these bonuses for those types as well.</p>
			<p><b>True Grit (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a gunslinger picks two deeds that she has access to and that she must spend grit to perform. She can perform these deeds for 1 grit point fewer (minimum 0) than usual. If the number of grit points to perform a deed is reduced to 0, the gunslinger can perform this deed as long as she has at least 1 grit point. If a deed could already be performed as long as she had at least 1 grit point, she can now perform that deed even when she has no grit points.</p>

					<p>A wyrm sniper swaps a trio of deeds for the following deeds.</p>
					<p>Munitions Master: At 7th level, a wyrm sniper can spend 1 grit point to reduce the number of full-round actions (or move actions, if the sniper has the Master Siege Engineer feat) required to load a light siege engine by 1. This deed replaces the gunslinger&#146;s startling shot deed.</p>
					<p>Skeleton Crew: At 11th level, as long as a wyrm sniper has at least 1 grit point, she treats all light siege engines as requiring a crew of one fewer than normal to operate (minimum 1). This deed replaces the gunslinger&#146;s lightning reload deed.</p>
					<p>Anti-Air Targeting: At 15th level, whenever a wyrm sniper targets a creature&#146;s wings with the targeting deed, the wyrm sniper completely disables one of the creature&#146;s wings on a successful hit. If the wyrm sniper hits her target, the creature falls to the ground, regardless of its altitude, taking the appropriate amount of falling damage as a result. As long as the target has at least one functioning wing, it may attempt a DC 20 Fly check to gain the benefits of feather fall instead of plummeting to the ground. In either case, it must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the wyrm sniper&#146;s level + the wyrm sniper&#146;s Wisdom modifier) or fall prone when reaching the ground. This ability replaces the gunslinger&#146;s menacing shot deed.</p>

					<p>Gunslingers spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.</p>
					<p>A wyrm sniper swaps a trio of deeds for the following deeds.</p>
					<p>Munitions Master: At 7th level, a wyrm sniper can spend 1 grit point to reduce the number of full-round actions (or move actions, if the sniper has the Master Siege Engineer feat) required to load a light siege engine by 1. This deed replaces the gunslinger&#146;s startling shot deed.</p>
					<p>Skeleton Crew: At 11th level, as long as a wyrm sniper has at least 1 grit point, she treats all light siege engines as requiring a crew of one fewer than normal to operate (minimum 1). This deed replaces the gunslinger&#146;s lightning reload deed.</p>
					<p>Anti-Air Targeting: At 15th level, whenever a wyrm sniper targets a creature&#146;s wings with the targeting deed, the wyrm sniper completely disables one of the creature&#146;s wings on a successful hit. If the wyrm sniper hits her target, the creature falls to the ground, regardless of its altitude, taking the appropriate amount of falling damage as a result. As long as the target has at least one functioning wing, it may attempt a DC 20 Fly check to gain the benefits of feather fall instead of plummeting to the ground. In either case, it must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the wyrm sniper&#146;s level + the wyrm sniper&#146;s Wisdom modifier) or fall prone when reaching the ground. This ability replaces the gunslinger&#146;s menacing shot deed.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>These long-shot artists are masters at taking down dragons with sharp shooting and light siege weaponry. The following are class features for wyrm snipers.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For a renegade few, battle sounds different than it does for the typical fighter. The clash of steel and the sizzle of spell energy are drowned out by the thunderous rhythm of gunfire&#151;the pounding beat of the gunslinger.</p>
			<p>Gunslingers are a bold and mysterious lot. While many treat the secrets of black powder with the same care and reverence that a wizard typically reserves for his spellbook, most gunslingers know that firearms are a secret that cannot remain concealed forever. While current firearms are simple, often imprecise, and even dangerous devices, they are a technology on the move, and one that will become even more powerful when it is fully fused with magic.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Gunslingers are thunderous artillery, often found where the fighting is fiercest. Brave, clever, and frequently foolhardy, many gunslingers push to position themselves at close range, barrels blazing, to take down their foes and demoralize their enemies. Other gunslingers are masters of distant death, picking off enemies from afar with their strange and wondrous weapons.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Gunslinger's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Gunslingers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with all firearms. They are proficient with all light armor. Wyrm snipers are proficient with light siege engines, in addition to the normal gunslinger weapon proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Gunsmith: </b>At 1st level, a gunslinger gains one of the following firearms of her choice: blunderbuss, musket, or pistol. Her starting weapon is battered, and only she knows how to use it properly. All other creatures treat her gun as if it had the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it does not work at all for anyone else trying to use it. This starting weapon can only be sold for scrap (it's worth 4d10 gp when sold). The gunslinger also gains Gunsmithing as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Grit (Ex): </b>A gunslinger makes her mark upon the world with daring deeds. Some gunslingers claim they belong to a mystical way of the gun, but it's more likely that the volatile nature of firearms simply prunes the unlucky and careless from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all gunslingers have grit. In game terms, grit is a fluctuating measure of a gunslinger's ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a gunslinger gains a number of grit points equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Her grit goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), though some feats and magic items may affect this maximum. A gunslinger spends grit to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains grit in the following ways.</p>
			<p><b>Critical Hit with a Firearm: </b>Each time the gunslinger confirms a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level does not restore grit.</p>
			<p><b>Killing Blow with a Firearm: </b>When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.</p>
			<p><b>Deeds: </b>Gunslingers spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.</p>
			<p>A wyrm sniper swaps a trio of deeds for the following deeds.</p>
			<p><i>Munitions Master: </i>At 7th level, a wyrm sniper can spend 1 grit point to reduce the number of full-round actions (or move actions, if the sniper has the Master Siege Engineer feat) required to load a light siege engine by 1. This deed replaces the gunslinger&#146;s startling shot deed.</p>
			<p><i>Skeleton Crew: </i>At 11th level, as long as a wyrm sniper has at least 1 grit point, she treats all light siege engines as requiring a crew of one fewer than normal to operate (minimum 1). This deed replaces the gunslinger&#146;s lightning reload deed.</p>

If the wyrm sniper hits her target, the creature falls to the ground, regardless of its altitude, taking the appropriate amount of falling damage as a result. As long as the target has at least one functioning wing, it may attempt a DC 20 Fly check to gain the benefits of feather fall instead of plummeting to the ground. In either case, it must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the wyrm sniper&#146;s level + the wyrm sniper&#146;s Wisdom modifier) or fall prone when reaching the ground. This ability replaces the gunslinger&#146;s menacing shot deed.</p>
			<p><b>Nimble (Ex): </b>Starting at 2nd level, a gunslinger gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC while wearing light or no armor. Anything that causes the gunslinger to lose her Dexterity bonus to AC also causes the gunslinger to lose this dodge bonus. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd level (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level).</p>
			<p><b>Siege Commander (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a wyrm sniper may select the Siege Commander combat feat as her bonus feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites.</p>
			<p><b>Heavy Gunner (Ex): </b>Starting at 5th level, a wyrm sniper may select one specific type of light siege weapon (such as a ballista or light bombard) in place of a specific type of firearm as part of her gun training class ability. Every 4 levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), when she can pick a new type of firearm for the gun training class ability, the gunslinger may again select another type of light siege engine.</p>
			<p><b>Master Siege Engineer (Ex): </b>At 12th level, a wyrm sniper may select the Master Siege Engineer combat feat as her bonus feat, even if she does not meet the feat&#146;s prerequisites.</p>
			<p><b>True Grit (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a gunslinger picks two deeds that she has access to and that she must spend grit to perform. She can perform these deeds for 1 grit point fewer (minimum 0) than usual. If the number of grit points to perform a deed is reduced to 0, the gunslinger can perform this deed as long as she has at least 1 grit point. If a deed could already be performed as long as she had at least 1 grit point, she can now perform that deed even when she has no grit points.</p>

The creature is staggered on its next turn. If a thronewarden uses this ability in a surprise round on a creature that has not yet acted, that creature instead loses its surprise-round action if it has one.</p>
					<p>Opening Shot (Ex): At 11th level as a standard action, a thronewarden can call her allies to action in a surprise round by spending 1 grit point and shooting a firearm into the air. Any allies within 30 feet who would not normally be able to act in the surprise round can act at the end of the surprise round (their order is determined by their initiative results; they act in normal initiative order in following rounds). Allies who would normally act in the surprise round but who have not yet acted can take a full round&#146;s worth of actions instead of just a move or standard action.</p>

					<p>Gunslingers spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.</p>
					<p>A thronewarden has access to the following deeds.</p>
					<p>Warning Shot (Ex): At 7th level as a standard action, a thronewarden with at least 1 grit point can purposely miss a creature that she could normally target with a firearm attack and make it second-guess its actions. The creature is staggered on its next turn. If a thronewarden uses this ability in a surprise round on a creature that has not yet acted, that creature instead loses its surprise-round action if it has one.</p>
					<p>Opening Shot (Ex): At 11th level as a standard action, a thronewarden can call her allies to action in a surprise round by spending 1 grit point and shooting a firearm into the air. Any allies within 30 feet who would not normally be able to act in the surprise round can act at the end of the surprise round (their order is determined by their initiative results; they act in normal initiative order in following rounds). Allies who would normally act in the surprise round but who have not yet acted can take a full round&#146;s worth of actions instead of just a move or standard action.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>As vigilant sentinels, thronewardens identify and head off trouble. First employed in the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar, they are now also found in the jungle courts of the Mwangi Expanse, the lesser chambers of Nex&#146;s Council of Three and Nine, and the Hurricane King&#146;s gatherings in the Shackles.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For a renegade few, battle sounds different than it does for the typical fighter. The clash of steel and the sizzle of spell energy are drowned out by the thunderous rhythm of gunfire&#151;the pounding beat of the gunslinger.</p>
			<p>Gunslingers are a bold and mysterious lot. While many treat the secrets of black powder with the same care and reverence that a wizard typically reserves for his spellbook, most gunslingers know that firearms are a secret that cannot remain concealed forever. While current firearms are simple, often imprecise, and even dangerous devices, they are a technology on the move, and one that will become even more powerful when it is fully fused with magic.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Gunslingers are thunderous artillery, often found where the fighting is fiercest. Brave, clever, and frequently foolhardy, many gunslingers push to position themselves at close range, barrels blazing, to take down their foes and demoralize their enemies. Other gunslingers are masters of distant death, picking off enemies from afar with their strange and wondrous weapons.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Gunslinger's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Gunslingers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with all firearms. They are proficient with all light armor.</p>
			<p><b>Gunsmith: </b>At 1st level, a gunslinger gains one of the following firearms of her choice: blunderbuss, musket, or pistol. Her starting weapon is battered, and only she knows how to use it properly. All other creatures treat her gun as if it had the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it does not work at all for anyone else trying to use it. This starting weapon can only be sold for scrap (it's worth 4d10 gp when sold). The gunslinger also gains Gunsmithing as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Grit (Ex): </b>A gunslinger makes her mark upon the world with daring deeds. Some gunslingers claim they belong to a mystical way of the gun, but it's more likely that the volatile nature of firearms simply prunes the unlucky and careless from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all gunslingers have grit. In game terms, grit is a fluctuating measure of a gunslinger's ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a gunslinger gains a number of grit points equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Her grit goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), though some feats and magic items may affect this maximum. A gunslinger spends grit to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains grit in the following ways.</p>
			<p><b>Critical Hit with a Firearm: </b>Each time the gunslinger confirms a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level does not restore grit.</p>
			<p><b>Killing Blow with a Firearm: </b>When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.</p>
			<p><b>Deeds: </b>Gunslingers spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.</p>
			<p>A thronewarden has access to the following deeds.</p>
			<p><i>Warning Shot (Ex): </i>At 7th level as a standard action, a thronewarden with at least 1 grit point can purposely miss a creature that she could normally target with a firearm attack and make it second-guess its actions. The creature is staggered on its next turn. If a thronewarden uses this ability in a surprise round on a creature that has not yet acted, that creature instead loses its surprise-round action if it has one. This deed replaces startling shot.</p>
			<p><i>Opening Shot (Ex): </i>At 11th level as a standard action, a thronewarden can call her allies to action in a surprise round by spending 1 grit point and shooting a firearm into the air. Any allies within 30 feet who would not normally be able to act in the surprise round can act at the end of the surprise round (their order is determined by their initiative results; they act in normal initiative order in following rounds). Allies who would normally act in the surprise round but who have not yet acted can take a full round&#146;s worth of actions instead of just a move or standard action.</p>
			<p><b>Hair-Trigger Reflexes (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, as long as she has at least 1 grit point, a thronewarden can act in a surprise round even if she doesn&#146;t notice her enemies, though she remains flat-footed until she acts. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on initiative checks. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 gunslinger levels beyond 2nd. Finally, at 10th level, she can spend 1 grit point to take both a standard action and a move action (or a full-round action) during the surprise round.</p>
			<p><b>Eye for Trouble (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a thronewarden can spend 1 grit point when she attempts a Perception or Sense Motive check to roll 1d6 and add the result to the check. She can do this after she attempts the check but only before the result is revealed.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feats: </b>At 4th level, and every four levels thereafter, a gunslinger gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained by normal advancement. These bonus feats must be combat or grit feats.</p>
			<p><b>Gun Training (Ex): </b>Starting at 5th level, a gunslinger can select one specific type of firearm (such as an axe musket, blunderbuss, musket, or pistol). She gains a bonus equal to her Dexterity modifier on damage rolls when firing that type of firearm. Furthermore, when she misfires with that type of firearm, the misfire value of that firearm increases by 2 instead of 4.</p>
			<p>Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), the gunslinger picks up another type of firearm, gaining these bonuses for those types as well.</p>
			<p><b>True Grit (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a gunslinger picks two deeds that she has access to and that she must spend grit to perform. She can perform these deeds for 1 grit point fewer (minimum 0) than usual. If the number of grit points to perform a deed is reduced to 0, the gunslinger can perform this deed as long as she has at least 1 grit point. If a deed could already be performed as long as she had at least 1 grit point, she can now perform that deed even when she has no grit points.</p>

					<p>At 1st level, a gunslinger gains one of the following firearms of her choice: blunderbuss, musket, or pistol. Her starting weapon is battered, and only she knows how to use it properly. All other creatures treat her gun as if it had the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it does not work at all for anyone else trying to use it. This starting weapon can only be sold for scrap (it's worth 4d10 gp when sold). The gunslinger also gains Gunsmithing as a bonus feat.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A gunslinger makes her mark upon the world with daring deeds. Some gunslingers claim they belong to a mystical way of the gun, but it's more likely that the volatile nature of firearms simply prunes the unlucky and careless from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all gunslingers have grit. In game terms, grit is a fluctuating measure of a gunslinger's ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a gunslinger gains a number of grit points equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Her grit goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), though some feats and magic items may affect this maximum. A gunslinger spends grit to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains grit in the following ways.</p>
					<p><i>Critical Hit with a Firearm: </i>Each time the gunslinger confirms a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level does not restore grit.</p>
					<p><i>Killing Blow with a Firearm: </i>When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.</p>

					<p>Gunslingers spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.</p>

					<p>Reliable (Ex): At 1st level, a techslinger can spend 1 grit point as a free action to prevent a timeworn firearm from glitching. This deed replaces quick clear.</p>
					<p>Charge Recycling (Ex): At 11th level, by spending 1 grit point, a techslinger can grant 1 temporary charge to a technological firearm, even if the firearm normally can no longer be recharged. This charge must be used within 1 hour or it fades. The techslinger can grant temporary charges to multiple firearms as long as she has enough grit, but temporary charges do not stack with themselves in the same firearm. At 15th level, the techslinger can grant 2 temporary charges when she uses this deed, and at 19th level, she can grant 3 temporary charges. This deed replaces expert loading.</p>
					<p>Heavy Weaponry Deeds (Ex): At 11th level, as long as the techslinger has at least 1 grit point, she can treat a heavy weapon as a firearm for the purpose of using deeds.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Techslingers spurn unreliable gunpowder weapons in favor of high-tech armaments. They learn to master the quirks of timeworn technology and methods of keeping weapons charged in a primitive world. Techslingers still start play with the black powder blunderbuss, pistol, or rifle granted by the gunsmith class ability, but they gain specialized powers for use after they gain weapons of advanced technology. A techslinger has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For a renegade few, battle sounds different than it does for the typical fighter. The clash of steel and the sizzle of spell energy are drowned out by the thunderous rhythm of gunfire&#151;the pounding beat of the gunslinger.</p>
			<p>Gunslingers are a bold and mysterious lot. While many treat the secrets of black powder with the same care and reverence that a wizard typically reserves for his spellbook, most gunslingers know that firearms are a secret that cannot remain concealed forever. While current firearms are simple, often imprecise, and even dangerous devices, they are a technology on the move, and one that will become even more powerful when it is fully fused with magic.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Gunslingers are thunderous artillery, often found where the fighting is fiercest. Brave, clever, and frequently foolhardy, many gunslingers push to position themselves at close range, barrels blazing, to take down their foes and demoralize their enemies. Other gunslingers are masters of distant death, picking off enemies from afar with their strange and wondrous weapons.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Gunslinger's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Gunslingers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with all firearms. They are proficient with all light armor.</p>
			<p><b>Gunsmith: </b>At 1st level, a gunslinger gains one of the following firearms of her choice: blunderbuss, musket, or pistol. Her starting weapon is battered, and only she knows how to use it properly. All other creatures treat her gun as if it had the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it does not work at all for anyone else trying to use it. This starting weapon can only be sold for scrap (it's worth 4d10 gp when sold). The gunslinger also gains Gunsmithing as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Grit (Ex): </b>A gunslinger makes her mark upon the world with daring deeds. Some gunslingers claim they belong to a mystical way of the gun, but it's more likely that the volatile nature of firearms simply prunes the unlucky and careless from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all gunslingers have grit. In game terms, grit is a fluctuating measure of a gunslinger's ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a gunslinger gains a number of grit points equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Her grit goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), though some feats and magic items may affect this maximum. A gunslinger spends grit to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains grit in the following ways.</p>
			<p><b>Critical Hit with a Firearm: </b>Each time the gunslinger confirms a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level does not restore grit.</p>
			<p><b>Killing Blow with a Firearm: </b>When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.</p>
			<p><b>Deeds: </b>Gunslingers spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.</p>
			<p>Techslingers have access to all gunslinger deeds, except as noted below for new deeds that replace standard gunslinger deeds.</p>
			<p><i>Covet Charge (Ex): </i>At 1st level, a techslinger can spend 1 grit point to use 1 charge fewer than normal when firing a technological weapon (minimum 0), as long as the weapon has enough charges remaining to be fired at least once. This deed replaces deadeye.</p>
			<p><i>Reliable (Ex): </i>At 1st level, a techslinger can spend 1 grit point as a free action to prevent a timeworn firearm from glitching. This deed replaces quick clear.</p>
			<p><i>Charge Recycling (Ex): </i>At 11th level, by spending 1 grit point, a techslinger can grant 1 temporary charge to a technological firearm, even if the firearm normally can no longer be recharged. This charge must be used within 1 hour or it fades. The techslinger can grant temporary charges to multiple firearms as long as she has enough grit, but temporary charges do not stack with themselves in the same firearm. At 15th level, the techslinger can grant 2 temporary charges when she uses this deed, and at 19th level, she can grant 3 temporary charges. This deed replaces expert loading.</p>
			<p><i>Heavy Weaponry Deeds (Ex): </i>At 11th level, as long as the techslinger has at least 1 grit point, she can treat a heavy weapon as a firearm for the purpose of using deeds.</p>
			<p><b>Nimble (Ex): </b>Starting at 2nd level, a gunslinger gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC while wearing light or no armor. Anything that causes the gunslinger to lose her Dexterity bonus to AC also causes the gunslinger to lose this dodge bonus. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd level (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level).</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feats: </b>At 4th level, and every four levels thereafter, a gunslinger gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained by normal advancement. These bonus feats must be combat or grit feats.</p>
			<p>A techslinger can select Technologist as a bonus feat, even though it&#146;s neither a combat nor a grit feat.</p>
			<p><b>Technic Training (Ex): </b>Starting at 5th level, a techslinger can select one specific type of advanced technology firearm (such as a laser pistol, mindrender, stun gun, or zero rifle). Thereafter, she gains a bonus equal to her Dexterity modifier on damage rolls when using that firearm. Furthermore, she treats all detrimental glitches of timeworn versions of her selected firearm as a result of no glitch. (She can retain the effects of beneficial glitches if she wishes.)</p>
			<p>Every 4 levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), the techslinger selects another type of advanced technology firearm, gaining these bonuses for those types as well. This ability replaces gun training.</p>
			<p><b>True Grit (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a gunslinger picks two deeds that she has access to and that she must spend grit to perform. She can perform these deeds for 1 grit point fewer (minimum 0) than usual. If the number of grit points to perform a deed is reduced to 0, the gunslinger can perform this deed as long as she has at least 1 grit point. If a deed could already be performed as long as she had at least 1 grit point, she can now perform that deed even when she has no grit points.</p>

					<p>A siege gunner swaps a pair of deeds of her choosing for the following.</p>
					<p>Targeted Blast (Ex): At 1st level, when using a firearm or siege engine that targets an area rather than a specific creature, the siege gunner can spend 1 grit point to focus the brunt of the blast on a single creature within the target area. The target creature takes 1 additional point of damage for each level the siege gunner possesses. This is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. At 5th level and for every 5 levels the siege gunner possesses beyond that, she can select an additional creature to target with this bonus damage. Targets must be selected before any attack rolls or saving throws are made. This ability replaces deadeye.</p>
					<p>Scattershot (Ex): At 3rd level, if the siege gunner has at least 1 grit point, she can increase the effectiveness of scattering shots from hand-held firearms and blast shots from siege engines. The cone radius of scattering shots or blast shots increases by 5 feet for every three levels the siege gunner possesses (to a maximum of 30 feet at 18th level). This ability replaces gunslinger initiative.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The Grand Duchy of Alkenstar has spawned all manner of firearm specialists, wielding small and large firearms alike. Siege gunners specialize in the very largest&#151; cannons, bombards, and firedrakes. These specialists are rarely seen outside of Alkenstar, however, in part because the duchy keeps close tabs on its most powerful guns and few are found elsewhere in the Inner Sea. A few siege gunners outside of Alkenstar make a living renting out their services and the use of their personal collection of siege weaponry to causes in which they believe or to the highest bidder.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For a renegade few, battle sounds different than it does for the typical fighter. The clash of steel and the sizzle of spell energy are drowned out by the thunderous rhythm of gunfire&#151;the pounding beat of the gunslinger.</p>
			<p>Gunslingers are a bold and mysterious lot. While many treat the secrets of black powder with the same care and reverence that a wizard typically reserves for his spellbook, most gunslingers know that firearms are a secret that cannot remain concealed forever. While current firearms are simple, often imprecise, and even dangerous devices, they are a technology on the move, and one that will become even more powerful when it is fully fused with magic.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Gunslingers are thunderous artillery, often found where the fighting is fiercest. Brave, clever, and frequently foolhardy, many gunslingers push to position themselves at close range, barrels blazing, to take down their foes and demoralize their enemies. Other gunslingers are masters of distant death, picking off enemies from afar with their strange and wondrous weapons.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Gunslinger's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Gunslingers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with all firearms. They are proficient with all light armor.</p>
			<p><b>Gunsmith: </b>At 1st level, a gunslinger gains one of the following firearms of her choice: blunderbuss, musket, or pistol. Her starting weapon is battered, and only she knows how to use it properly. All other creatures treat her gun as if it had the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it does not work at all for anyone else trying to use it. This starting weapon can only be sold for scrap (it's worth 4d10 gp when sold). The gunslinger also gains Gunsmithing as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Grit (Ex): </b>A siege gunner relies less on luck and intuition and more on cold calculation and wit. The number of grit points a siege gunner gains each day and her maximum grit are based on the siege gunner&#146;s Intelligence modifier rather than her Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p><i>Critical Hit with a Firearm: </i><b>Each time the gunslinger confirms a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level does not restore grit.</b></p>
			<p><i>Killing Blow with a Firearm: </i><b>When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.</b></p>
			<p><b>Deeds: </b>Gunslingers spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.</p>
			<p>A siege gunner swaps a pair of deeds of her choosing for the following.</p>
			<p><b>Targeted Blast (Ex): </b>At 1st level, when using a firearm or siege engine that targets an area rather than a specific creature, the siege gunner can spend 1 grit point to focus the brunt of the blast on a single creature within the target area. The target creature takes 1 additional point of damage for each level the siege gunner possesses. This is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. At 5th level and for every 5 levels the siege gunner possesses beyond that, she can select an additional creature to target with this bonus damage. Targets must be selected before any attack rolls or saving throws are made. This ability replaces deadeye.</p>
			<p><b>Scattershot (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, if the siege gunner has at least 1 grit point, she can increase the effectiveness of scattering shots from hand-held firearms and blast shots from siege engines. The cone radius of scattering shots or blast shots increases by 5 feet for every three levels the siege gunner possesses (to a maximum of 30 feet at 18th level). This ability replaces gunslinger initiative.</p>
			<p><b>Engineer Training (Ex): </b>A siege gunner is trained in all aspects of siegecraft, including the workings of siege engines and knowledge of the structures that are often the target of their assaults. Starting at 2nd level, a siege gunner gains a bonus on Knowledge (engineering) checks equal to 1/2 her gunslinger level. This ability replaces nimble.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feats: </b>At 4th level, a siege gunner gains Siege EngineerUC as a bonus feat. At 8th level, she gains Master Siege EngineerUC as a bonus feat. She does not need to meet the prerequisites for these feats. At 12th level and for every 4 levels thereafter, the siege gunner gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained by normal advancement. These additional bonus feats must be combat or grit feats, and she must meet the prerequisites as normal. This replaces the gunslinger&#146;s normal bonus feats.</p>
			<p><b>Gun Training (Ex): </b>Starting at 5th level, a gunslinger can select one specific type of firearm (such as an axe musket, blunderbuss, musket, or pistol). She gains a bonus equal to her Dexterity modifier on damage rolls when firing that type of firearm. Furthermore, when she misfires with that type of firearm, the misfire value of that firearm increases by 2 instead of 4.</p>
			<p>Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), the gunslinger picks up another type of firearm, gaining these bonuses for those types as well.</p>
			<p><b>True Grit (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a gunslinger picks two deeds that she has access to and that she must spend grit to perform. She can perform these deeds for 1 grit point fewer (minimum 0) than usual. If the number of grit points to perform a deed is reduced to 0, the gunslinger can perform this deed as long as she has at least 1 grit point. If a deed could already be performed as long as she had at least 1 grit point, she can now perform that deed even when she has no grit points.</p>

					<p>A gunslinger makes her mark upon the world with daring deeds. Some gunslingers claim they belong to a mystical way of the gun, but it's more likely that the volatile nature of firearms simply prunes the unlucky and careless from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all gunslingers have grit. In game terms, grit is a fluctuating measure of a gunslinger's ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a gunslinger gains a number of grit points equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Her grit goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), though some feats and magic items may affect this maximum. A gunslinger spends grit to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains grit in the following ways.</p>
					<p><i>Critical Hit with a Firearm: </i>Each time the gunslinger confirms a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level does not restore grit.</p>
					<p><i>Killing Blow with a Firearm: </i>When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.</p>

Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.</p>
					<p>A scatter gunner gains the following deeds, each of which functions only when he uses a weapon with the scatter weapon quality to make a scattering shot.</p>
					<p>Careful Shot (Ex) As long as a scatter gunner has at least 1 grit point when making a scattering shot, he takes a penalty equal to his Wisdom modifier on his attack rolls against any allies in the area. He can spend 1 grit point when making a scattering shot to automatically miss a number of creatures equal to his Wisdom modifier. This replaces the deadeye deed.</p>
					<p>Scatter Artist (Ex): At 3rd level, when using a firearm to make a scattering shot, a scatter gunner can spend 1 grit point to add one of the following effects to his attack.</p>
					<p>Restricted Barrel: The scattering shot attacks all creatures in a line rather than in a cone. The line&#146;s length is twice the length of the weapon&#146;s cone (30 feet for most early firearms).</p>
					<p>Shaped Blast: Select one additional square adjacent to the scattering shot&#146;s area of effect; creatures in this square are also affected by the scattering shot.</p>
					<p>Vortex: The firearm releases an explosive torrent of air in the scattering shot&#146;s affected area for 1 round, creating a strong wind effect (25 mph) that can disperse fog and smoke effects such as those created by fog cloud. This replaces the utility shot deed.</p>
					<p>Overload (Ex): At 7th level, a scatter gunner knows just how to hold his weapon to maximize its devastating scattering effects. As a full-round action, a scatter gunner can make a scattering shot to fire a concentrated payload of pellets that strains his firearm. This doubles the area affected by the scattering shot (a 30-foot cone for most early firearms), increases the firearm&#146;s misfire value by 2, and causes each successful attack to deal an additional 1d6 points of damage that is not multiplied on a critical hit. This additional damage increases to 2d6 at 13th level and 3d6 at 19th level. The scatter gunner must spend 1 grit point to perform this deed. This replaces the dead shot deed.</p>
					<p>Satchel Shot (Ex): At 7th level, as a full-round action, a scatter gunner can load and fire an explosive shell, consuming ammunition as though he had made a scattering shot. This functions like throwing a splash weapon at a grid intersection but uses his firearm&#146;s range increment, attack bonus, and magic special abilities (if any). The shell affects creatures in a 10-foot radius as though the scatter gunner had made a scattering shot against them, and damaged creatures must succeed at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half the scatter gunner&#146;s level + the scatter gunner&#146;s Dexterity modifier) or catch fire (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 444). This replaces the targeting deed.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Punishing firearms such as the blunderbuss and dragon pistol can lay waste to invaders in tight corridors, and the dwarves of Dongun Hold have pioneered masterful methods for making the most of these indiscriminate weapons.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For a renegade few, battle sounds different than it does for the typical fighter. The clash of steel and the sizzle of spell energy are drowned out by the thunderous rhythm of gunfire&#151;the pounding beat of the gunslinger.</p>
			<p>Gunslingers are a bold and mysterious lot. While many treat the secrets of black powder with the same care and reverence that a wizard typically reserves for his spellbook, most gunslingers know that firearms are a secret that cannot remain concealed forever. While current firearms are simple, often imprecise, and even dangerous devices, they are a technology on the move, and one that will become even more powerful when it is fully fused with magic.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Gunslingers are thunderous artillery, often found where the fighting is fiercest. Brave, clever, and frequently foolhardy, many gunslingers push to position themselves at close range, barrels blazing, to take down their foes and demoralize their enemies. Other gunslingers are masters of distant death, picking off enemies from afar with their strange and wondrous weapons.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Gunslinger's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Gunslingers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with all firearms. They are proficient with all light armor.</p>
			<p><b>Gunsmith: </b>At 1st level, a gunslinger gains one of the following firearms of her choice: blunderbuss, musket, or pistol. Her starting weapon is battered, and only she knows how to use it properly. All other creatures treat her gun as if it had the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it does not work at all for anyone else trying to use it. This starting weapon can only be sold for scrap (it's worth 4d10 gp when sold). The gunslinger also gains Gunsmithing as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Grit (Ex): </b>A gunslinger makes her mark upon the world with daring deeds. Some gunslingers claim they belong to a mystical way of the gun, but it's more likely that the volatile nature of firearms simply prunes the unlucky and careless from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all gunslingers have grit. In game terms, grit is a fluctuating measure of a gunslinger's ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a gunslinger gains a number of grit points equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Her grit goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), though some feats and magic items may affect this maximum. A gunslinger spends grit to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains grit in the following ways.</p>
			<p><i>Critical Hit with a Firearm: </i>Each time the gunslinger confirms a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level does not restore grit.</p>
			<p><i>Killing Blow with a Firearm: </i>When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.</p>
			<p><b>Deeds: </b>Gunslingers spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.</p>
			<p>A scatter gunner gains the following deeds, each of which functions only when he uses a weapon with the scatter weapon quality to make a scattering shot.</p>
			<p><i>Careful Shot (Ex) </i>As long as a scatter gunner has at least 1 grit point when making a scattering shot, he takes a penalty equal to his Wisdom modifier on his attack rolls against any allies in the area. He can spend 1 grit point when making a scattering shot to automatically miss a number of creatures equal to his Wisdom modifier. This replaces the deadeye deed.</p>
			<p><i>Scatter Artist (Ex): </i>At 3rd level, when using a firearm to make a scattering shot, a scatter gunner can spend 1 grit point to add one of the following effects to his attack.</p>
			<list>
				<li>Restricted Barrel: The scattering shot attacks all creatures in a line rather than in a cone. The line&#146;s length is twice the length of the weapon&#146;s cone (30 feet for most early firearms).</li>
				<li>Shaped Blast: Select one additional square adjacent to the scattering shot&#146;s area of effect; creatures in this square are also affected by the scattering shot.</li>
				<li>Vortex: The firearm releases an explosive torrent of air in the scattering shot&#146;s affected area for 1 round, creating a strong wind effect (25 mph) that can disperse fog and smoke effects such as those created by fog cloud.</li>
			</list>
			<p>This replaces the utility shot deed.</p>
			<p>Overload (Ex): At 7th level, a scatter gunner knows just how to hold his weapon to maximize its devastating scattering effects. As a full-round action, a scatter gunner can make a scattering shot to fire a concentrated payload of pellets that strains his firearm. This doubles the area affected by the scattering shot (a 30-foot cone for most early firearms), increases the firearm&#146;s misfire value by 2, and causes each successful attack to deal an additional 1d6 points of damage that is not multiplied on a critical hit. This additional damage increases to 2d6 at 13th level and 3d6 at 19th level. The scatter gunner must spend 1 grit point to perform this deed. This replaces the dead shot deed.</p>
			<p>Satchel Shot (Ex): At 7th level, as a full-round action, a scatter gunner can load and fire an explosive shell, consuming ammunition as though he had made a scattering shot. This functions like throwing a splash weapon at a grid intersection but uses his firearm&#146;s range increment, attack bonus, and magic special abilities (if any). The shell affects creatures in a 10-foot radius as though the scatter gunner had made a scattering shot against them, and damaged creatures must succeed at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half the scatter gunner&#146;s level + the scatter gunner&#146;s Dexterity modifier) or catch fire (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 444). This replaces the targeting deed.</p>
			<p><b>Nimble (Ex): </b>Starting at 2nd level, a gunslinger gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC while wearing light or no armor. Anything that causes the gunslinger to lose her Dexterity bonus to AC also causes the gunslinger to lose this dodge bonus. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd level (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level).</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feats: </b>At 4th level, and every four levels thereafter, a gunslinger gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained by normal advancement. These bonus feats must be combat or grit feats.</p>
			<p><b>Gun Training (Ex): </b>Starting at 5th level, a gunslinger can select one specific type of firearm (such as an axe musket, blunderbuss, musket, or pistol). She gains a bonus equal to her Dexterity modifier on damage rolls when firing that type of firearm. Furthermore, when she misfires with that type of firearm, the misfire value of that firearm increases by 2 instead of 4.</p>
			<p>Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), the gunslinger picks up another type of firearm, gaining these bonuses for those types as well.</p>
			<p><b>True Grit (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a gunslinger picks two deeds that she has access to and that she must spend grit to perform. She can perform these deeds for 1 grit point fewer (minimum 0) than usual. If the number of grit points to perform a deed is reduced to 0, the gunslinger can perform this deed as long as she has at least 1 grit point. If a deed could already be performed as long as she had at least 1 grit point, she can now perform that deed even when she has no grit points.</p>

					<p>A mysterious stranger is a force to be reckoned with. Instead of using her Wisdom to determine the number of grit points she gains at the start of each day, she uses Charisma. This ability works in all other ways like the gunslinger&#146;s grit class feature.</p>
					<p>A gunslinger makes her mark upon the world with daring deeds. Some gunslingers claim they belong to a mystical way of the gun, but it's more likely that the volatile nature of firearms simply prunes the unlucky and careless from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all gunslingers have grit. In game terms, grit is a fluctuating measure of a gunslinger's ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a gunslinger gains a number of grit points equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Her grit goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), though some feats and magic items may affect this maximum. A gunslinger spends grit to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains grit in the following ways.</p>
					<p><i>Critical Hit with a Firearm: </i>Each time the gunslinger confirms a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level does not restore grit.</p>
					<p><i>Killing Blow with a Firearm: </i>When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.</p>

					<p>Gunslingers spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.</p>
					<p>A mysterious stranger swaps a pair of deeds for the following.</p>
					<p>Focused Aim (Ex): At 1st level, as a swift action, the mysterious stranger can spend 1 grit point to gain a bonus on all firearm damage rolls equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1) with all firearm attacks she makes until the end of her turn. At 7th level, when she uses the dead shot deed, she multiplies this bonus by the number of hits she made while rolling the Dead Shot attack. This deed replaces the quick clear deed.</p>
					<p>Clipping Shot (Ex): At 11th level, when the mysterious stranger misses with a firearm attack, she can spend 1 grit point to deal half the damage that attack would have dealt if it were a hit (roll damage normally). She can decide to use this deed and spend the grit point after making the attack. This deed has no effect if the attack used the dead shot deed. The cost of using this deed cannot be reduced with the Signature Deed feat, the true grit class feature, or any similar effect. This replaces the bleeding wound deed.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Gunslingers use a potent mixture of common sense and manual dexterity in order to control the fickle power of their weapons. But a few rare gunslingers seem to accomplish their chosen tasks purely through willpower and an unwillingness to ever give up. These mysterious strangers use their force of personality to keep going when the chips are down, often moving on from a region as soon as they accomplish their goals&#151;hence the name.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For a renegade few, battle sounds different than it does for the typical fighter. The clash of steel and the sizzle of spell energy are drowned out by the thunderous rhythm of gunfire&#151;the pounding beat of the gunslinger.</p>
			<p>Gunslingers are a bold and mysterious lot. While many treat the secrets of black powder with the same care and reverence that a wizard typically reserves for his spellbook, most gunslingers know that firearms are a secret that cannot remain concealed forever. While current firearms are simple, often imprecise, and even dangerous devices, they are a technology on the move, and one that will become even more powerful when it is fully fused with magic.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Gunslingers are thunderous artillery, often found where the fighting is fiercest. Brave, clever, and frequently foolhardy, many gunslingers push to position themselves at close range, barrels blazing, to take down their foes and demoralize their enemies. Other gunslingers are masters of distant death, picking off enemies from afar with their strange and wondrous weapons.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Gunslinger's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Gunslingers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with all firearms. They are proficient with all light armor.</p>
			<p><b>Gunsmith: </b>At 1st level, a gunslinger gains one of the following firearms of her choice: blunderbuss, musket, or pistol. Her starting weapon is battered, and only she knows how to use it properly. All other creatures treat her gun as if it had the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it does not work at all for anyone else trying to use it. This starting weapon can only be sold for scrap (it's worth 4d10 gp when sold). The gunslinger also gains Gunsmithing as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Grit (Ex): </b>A mysterious stranger is a force to be reckoned with. Instead of using her Wisdom to determine the number of grit points she gains at the start of each day, she uses Charisma. This ability works in all other ways like the gunslinger&#146;s grit class feature.</p>
			<p>A gunslinger makes her mark upon the world with daring deeds. Some gunslingers claim they belong to a mystical way of the gun, but it's more likely that the volatile nature of firearms simply prunes the unlucky and careless from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all gunslingers have grit. In game terms, grit is a fluctuating measure of a gunslinger's ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a gunslinger gains a number of grit points equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Her grit goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), though some feats and magic items may affect this maximum. A gunslinger spends grit to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains grit in the following ways.</p>
			<p><b>Critical Hit with a Firearm: </b>Each time the gunslinger confirms a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level does not restore grit.</p>
			<p><b>Killing Blow with a Firearm: </b>When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.</p>
			<p><b>Deeds: </b>Gunslingers spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.</p>
			<p>A mysterious stranger swaps a pair of deeds for the following.</p>
			<p><i>Focused Aim (Ex): </i>At 1st level, as a swift action, the mysterious stranger can spend 1 grit point to gain a bonus on all firearm damage rolls equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1) with all firearm attacks she makes until the end of her turn. At 7th level, when she uses the dead shot deed, she multiplies this bonus by the number of hits she made while rolling the Dead Shot attack. This deed replaces the quick clear deed.</p>
			<p><i>Clipping Shot (Ex): </i>At 11th level, when the mysterious stranger misses with a firearm attack, she can spend 1 grit point to deal half the damage that attack would have dealt if it were a hit (roll damage normally). She can decide to use this deed and spend the grit point after making the attack. This deed has no effect if the attack used the dead shot deed. The cost of using this deed cannot be reduced with the Signature Deed feat, the true grit class feature, or any similar effect. This replaces the bleeding wound deed.</p>
			<p><b>Lucky (Ex): </b>Starting at 2nd level, a mysterious stranger gains a +1 luck bonus on Will saving throws. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd level (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level). This ability replaces nimble.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feats: </b>At 4th level, and every four levels thereafter, a gunslinger gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained by normal advancement. These bonus feats must be combat or grit feats.</p>
			<p><b>Stranger&#146;s Fortune (Ex): </b>Starting at 5th level, a mysterious stranger can ignore a firearm misfire a number of times per day equal to her Charisma bonus. She can use this ability as a free action. This ability replaces gun training 1.</p>
			<p><b>Gun Training (Ex): </b>Starting at 9th level, a gunslinger can select one specific type of firearm (such as an axe musket, blunderbuss, musket, or pistol). She gains a bonus equal to her Dexterity modifier on damage rolls when firing that type of firearm. Furthermore, when she misfires with that type of firearm, the misfire value of that firearm increases by 2 instead of 4.</p>
			<p>Every four levels thereafter (13th, and 17th), the gunslinger picks up another type of firearm, gaining these bonuses for those types as well.</p>
			<p><b>True Grit (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a gunslinger picks two deeds that she has access to and that she must spend grit to perform. She can perform these deeds for 1 grit point fewer (minimum 0) than usual. If the number of grit points to perform a deed is reduced to 0, the gunslinger can perform this deed as long as she has at least 1 grit point. If a deed could already be performed as long as she had at least 1 grit point, she can now perform that deed even when she has no grit points.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A gunslinger makes her mark upon the world with daring deeds. Some gunslingers claim they belong to a mystical way of the gun, but it's more likely that the volatile nature of firearms simply prunes the unlucky and careless from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all gunslingers have grit. In game terms, grit is a fluctuating measure of a gunslinger's ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a gunslinger gains a number of grit points equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Her grit goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), though some feats and magic items may affect this maximum. A gunslinger spends grit to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains grit in the following ways.</p>
					<p><i>Critical Hit with a Firearm: </i>Each time the gunslinger confirms a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level does not restore grit.</p>
					<p><i>Killing Blow with a Firearm: </i>When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.</p>

When she does, she increases the range increment of the firearm she is firing by 10 feet. This stacks with other abilities that increase her range increment. This deed replaces the gunslinger&#146;s dodge deed.</p>
					<p>Fast Musket (Ex): At 3rd level, as long as the musket master has 1 grit point, she can reload any two-handed firearm as if it were a one-handed firearm. This deed replaces the utility shot deed.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Pistols and other one-handed firearms are often easy to conceal and faster to load than other firearms, and do sufficient damage for most situations. But some gunslingers want a little more firepower and range. These are the musket masters; the best of these gunslingers can reload a musket with dazzling speed, potentially putting even their pistol-wielding brethren to shame.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For a renegade few, battle sounds different than it does for the typical fighter. The clash of steel and the sizzle of spell energy are drowned out by the thunderous rhythm of gunfire&#151;the pounding beat of the gunslinger.</p>
			<p>Gunslingers are a bold and mysterious lot. While many treat the secrets of black powder with the same care and reverence that a wizard typically reserves for his spellbook, most gunslingers know that firearms are a secret that cannot remain concealed forever. While current firearms are simple, often imprecise, and even dangerous devices, they are a technology on the move, and one that will become even more powerful when it is fully fused with magic.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Gunslingers are thunderous artillery, often found where the fighting is fiercest. Brave, clever, and frequently foolhardy, many gunslingers push to position themselves at close range, barrels blazing, to take down their foes and demoralize their enemies. Other gunslingers are masters of distant death, picking off enemies from afar with their strange and wondrous weapons.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Gunslinger's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Instead of proficiency with all firearms, a musket master only gains proficiency with two-handed firearms. She must take the Exotic Weapon Proficiency (firearm) feat to gain proficiency with one-handed firearms and firearm siege engines. Gunslingers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons. They are proficient with all light armor.</p>
			<p><b>Gunsmith: </b>A musket master must take a musket when she chooses a battered firearm at 1st level. . Her starting weapon is battered, and only she knows how to use it properly. All other creatures treat her gun as if it had the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it does not work at all for anyone else trying to use it. This starting weapon can only be sold for scrap (it's worth 4d10 gp when sold). The gunslinger also gains Gunsmithing as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Grit (Ex): </b>A gunslinger makes her mark upon the world with daring deeds. Some gunslingers claim they belong to a mystical way of the gun, but it's more likely that the volatile nature of firearms simply prunes the unlucky and careless from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all gunslingers have grit. In game terms, grit is a fluctuating measure of a gunslinger's ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a gunslinger gains a number of grit points equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Her grit goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), though some feats and magic items may affect this maximum. A gunslinger spends grit to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains grit in the following ways.</p>
			<p><b>Critical Hit with a Firearm: </b>Each time the gunslinger confirms a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level does not restore grit.</p>
			<p><b>Killing Blow with a Firearm: </b>When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.</p>
			<p><b>Deeds: </b>Gunslingers spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.</p>
			<p>A musket master swaps a pair of deeds for the following.</p>
			<p><i>Steady Aim (Ex): </i>At 1st level, as long as a musket master has at least 1 grit point, she can take a move-equivalent action to increase the accuracy of a two-handed firearm. When she does, she increases the range increment of the firearm she is firing by 10 feet. This stacks with other abilities that increase her range increment. This deed replaces the gunslinger&#146;s dodge deed.</p>
			<p><i>Fast Musket (Ex): </i>At 3rd level, as long as the musket master has 1 grit point, she can reload any two-handed firearm as if it were a one-handed firearm. This deed replaces the utility shot deed.</p>
			<p><b>Rapid Reloader: </b>At 1st level, a musket master gains Rapid Reload (muskets) as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Nimble (Ex): </b>Starting at 2nd level, a gunslinger gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC while wearing light or no armor. Anything that causes the gunslinger to lose her Dexterity bonus to AC also causes the gunslinger to lose this dodge bonus. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd level (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level).</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feats: </b>At 4th level, and every four levels thereafter, a gunslinger gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained by normal advancement. These bonus feats must be combat or grit feats.</p>
			<p><b>Musket Training (Ex): </b>Starting at 5th level, a musket master increases her skill with two-handed firearms. She gains a bonus on damage rolls equal to her Dexterity modifier, and when she misfires with a two-handed firearm, the misfire value increases by 2 instead of 4. Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), the bonus on damage rolls increases by +1. This replaces firearm training 1, 2, 3, and 4.</p>
			<p><b>True Grit (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a gunslinger picks two deeds that she has access to and that she must spend grit to perform. She can perform these deeds for 1 grit point fewer (minimum 0) than usual. If the number of grit points to perform a deed is reduced to 0, the gunslinger can perform this deed as long as she has at least 1 grit point. If a deed could already be performed as long as she had at least 1 grit point, she can now perform that deed even when she has no grit points.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Trouble always finds a maverick, whether she is a con artist or an honest gambler. Quick with her gun and no stranger to barroom brawls, she can hold her own when bullets and punches start flying.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For a renegade few, battle sounds different than it does for the typical fighter. The clash of steel and the sizzle of spell energy are drowned out by the thunderous rhythm of gunfire&#151;the pounding beat of the gunslinger.</p>
			<p>Gunslingers are a bold and mysterious lot. While many treat the secrets of black powder with the same care and reverence that a wizard typically reserves for his spellbook, most gunslingers know that firearms are a secret that cannot remain concealed forever. While current firearms are simple, often imprecise, and even dangerous devices, they are a technology on the move, and one that will become even more powerful when it is fully fused with magic.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Gunslingers are thunderous artillery, often found where the fighting is fiercest. Brave, clever, and frequently foolhardy, many gunslingers push to position themselves at close range, barrels blazing, to take down their foes and demoralize their enemies. Other gunslingers are masters of distant death, picking off enemies from afar with their strange and wondrous weapons.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Gunslinger's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Gunslingers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with all firearms. They are proficient with all light armor.</p>
			<p><b>Gunsmith: </b>At 1st level, a gunslinger gains one of the following firearms of her choice: blunderbuss, musket, or pistol. Her starting weapon is battered, and only she knows how to use it properly. All other creatures treat her gun as if it had the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it does not work at all for anyone else trying to use it. This starting weapon can only be sold for scrap (it's worth 4d10 gp when sold). The gunslinger also gains Gunsmithing as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Grit (Ex): </b>A gunslinger makes her mark upon the world with daring deeds. Some gunslingers claim they belong to a mystical way of the gun, but it's more likely that the volatile nature of firearms simply prunes the unlucky and careless from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all gunslingers have grit. In game terms, grit is a fluctuating measure of a gunslinger's ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a gunslinger gains a number of grit points equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Her grit goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), though some feats and magic items may affect this maximum. A gunslinger spends grit to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains grit in the following ways.</p>
			<p><b>Critical Hit with a Firearm: </b>Each time the gunslinger confirms a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level does not restore grit.</p>
			<p><b>Killing Blow with a Firearm: </b>When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.</p>
			<p><b>Deeds: </b>Gunslingers spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.</p>
			<p>A maverick gains the following three deeds.</p>
			<p><i>Stacked Deck (Ex) </i>At 1st level, the maverick can spend 1 grit point when she attempts a Bluff, Profession (gambler), or Sleight of Hand check to roll 1d6 and add the result to the check. She can do this after she rolls the check but before the result is revealed. If the result of the d6 roll is a natural 6, she rolls another 1d6 and adds it to the check. She can continue to do this as long as she rolls natural 6s, up to a number of times equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1).</p>
			<p><i>Fist Fighter (Ex) </i>At 3rd level, as long as the maverick has at least 1 grit point, she gains the benefit of the Improved Unarmed Strike feat.</p>
			<p><i>Gun Twirl (Ex) </i>At 3rd level, as long as the maverick has at least 1 grit point, she can use flashy gunplay to intimidate her opponents. She gains the Dazzling Display feat and can use it with any firearm, even if she doesn&#146;t have Weapon Focus in that firearm.</p>
			<p><b>Nimble (Ex): </b>Starting at 2nd level, a gunslinger gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC while wearing light or no armor. Anything that causes the gunslinger to lose her Dexterity bonus to AC also causes the gunslinger to lose this dodge bonus. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd level (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level).</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feats: </b>At 4th level, and every four levels thereafter, a gunslinger gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained by normal advancement. These bonus feats must be combat or grit feats.</p>
			<p><b>Gun Training (Ex): </b>Starting at 5th level, a gunslinger can select one specific type of firearm (such as an axe musket, blunderbuss, musket, or pistol). She gains a bonus equal to her Dexterity modifier on damage rolls when firing that type of firearm. Furthermore, when she misfires with that type of firearm, the misfire value of that firearm increases by 2 instead of 4.</p>
			<p>Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), the gunslinger picks up another type of firearm, gaining these bonuses for those types as well.</p>
			<p><b>True Grit (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a gunslinger picks two deeds that she has access to and that she must spend grit to perform. She can perform these deeds for 1 grit point fewer (minimum 0) than usual. If the number of grit points to perform a deed is reduced to 0, the gunslinger can perform this deed as long as she has at least 1 grit point. If a deed could already be performed as long as she had at least 1 grit point, she can now perform that deed even when she has no grit points.</p>

					<p>A gunner squire swaps a pair of deeds for the following. two deeds The new deed descriptions include information on which deeds from the gunslinger class feature these new deeds replace.</p>
					<p>Spotter (Ex): At 1st level, as a standard action, a gunner squire can spend 1 grit point to pinpoint a target within her line of sight and inform her knightly liege of the target&#146;s exact location. During the knight&#146;s next turn, if he makes a ranged attack against the pinpointed target and would take a penalty on his attack roll due to range, he may reduce this penalty by an amount equal to his gunner squire&#146;s Wisdom modifier (to a minimum penalty of 0). The gunner squire must be adjacent to her liege and able to communicate to use this deed, though a knight may move away from the gunner squire during his turn and still gain the benefits of this deed. This deed replaces the gunslinger&#146;s dodge deed.</p>
					<p>Side Arm (Ex): At 3rd level, as a full-round action, a gunner squire can spend 1 grit point to reload a one-handed or two-handed firearm she is holding. If the firearm has multiple barrels, she can reload a number of barrels per round equal to her Dexterity modifier (minimum 1). A gunner squire equipped with alchemical cartridges (see Ultimate Equipment) can use this deed to reload multiple firearms at once, dividing the number of barrels she&#146;s able to reload among the firearms she is carrying however she wishes, even if this would mean stowing and retrieving multiple firearms from her equipment with one action. Abilities, deeds, and feats that decrease reloading time (such as Rapid Reload) do not improve this deed. This deed replaces gunslinger initiative.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Prepared to reload or repair her lord&#146;s firearms at a moment&#146;s notice, the gunner squire is an indispensable aid for knights skilled in the use of pistols and rifles.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For a renegade few, battle sounds different than it does for the typical fighter. The clash of steel and the sizzle of spell energy are drowned out by the thunderous rhythm of gunfire&#151;the pounding beat of the gunslinger.</p>
			<p>Gunslingers are a bold and mysterious lot. While many treat the secrets of black powder with the same care and reverence that a wizard typically reserves for his spellbook, most gunslingers know that firearms are a secret that cannot remain concealed forever. While current firearms are simple, often imprecise, and even dangerous devices, they are a technology on the move, and one that will become even more powerful when it is fully fused with magic.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Gunslingers are thunderous artillery, often found where the fighting is fiercest. Brave, clever, and frequently foolhardy, many gunslingers push to position themselves at close range, barrels blazing, to take down their foes and demoralize their enemies. Other gunslingers are masters of distant death, picking off enemies from afar with their strange and wondrous weapons.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Gunslinger's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Gunslingers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with all firearms. They are proficient with all light armor.</p>
			<p><b>Gunsmith: </b>At 1st level, a gunslinger gains one of the following firearms of her choice: blunderbuss, musket, or pistol. Her starting weapon is battered, and only she knows how to use it properly. All other creatures treat her gun as if it had the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it does not work at all for anyone else trying to use it. This starting weapon can only be sold for scrap (it's worth 4d10 gp when sold). The gunslinger also gains Gunsmithing as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Grit (Ex): </b>A gunslinger makes her mark upon the world with daring deeds. Some gunslingers claim they belong to a mystical way of the gun, but it's more likely that the volatile nature of firearms simply prunes the unlucky and careless from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all gunslingers have grit. In game terms, grit is a fluctuating measure of a gunslinger's ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a gunslinger gains a number of grit points equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Her grit goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), though some feats and magic items may affect this maximum. A gunslinger spends grit to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains grit in the following ways.</p>
			<p><b>Critical Hit with a Firearm: </b>Each time the gunslinger confirms a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level does not restore grit.</p>
			<p><b>Killing Blow with a Firearm: </b>When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.</p>
			<p><b>Deeds: </b>Gunslingers spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.</p>
			<p>A gunner squire swaps a pair of deeds for the following. two deeds The new deed descriptions include information on which deeds from the gunslinger class feature these new deeds replace.</p>
			<p><i>Spotter (Ex): </i>At 1st level, as a standard action, a gunner squire can spend 1 grit point to pinpoint a target within her line of sight and inform her knightly liege of the target&#146;s exact location. During the knight&#146;s next turn, if he makes a ranged attack against the pinpointed target and would take a penalty on his attack roll due to range, he may reduce this penalty by an amount equal to his gunner squire&#146;s Wisdom modifier (to a minimum penalty of 0). The gunner squire must be adjacent to her liege and able to communicate to use this deed, though a knight may move away from the gunner squire during his turn and still gain the benefits of this deed. This deed replaces the gunslinger&#146;s dodge deed.</p>
			<p><i>Side Arm (Ex): </i>At 3rd level, as a full-round action, a gunner squire can spend 1 grit point to reload a one-handed or two-handed firearm she is holding. If the firearm has multiple barrels, she can reload a number of barrels per round equal to her Dexterity modifier (minimum 1). A gunner squire equipped with alchemical cartridges (see Ultimate Equipment) can use this deed to reload multiple firearms at once, dividing the number of barrels she&#146;s able to reload among the firearms she is carrying however she wishes, even if this would mean stowing and retrieving multiple firearms from her equipment with one action. Abilities, deeds, and feats that decrease reloading time (such as Rapid Reload) do not improve this deed. This deed replaces gunslinger initiative.</p>
			<p><b>Safe Handling (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, as a full-round action, a gunner squire can temporarily ensure the safety of a firearm she is holding, reducing its misfire chance by 1 (to a minimum of 0) on the next attack roll made with that firearm. This reduction does not stack with itself. This reduction occurs after any increases are calculated for firing with the broken condition, or for any other effect that might increase the misfire value of a firearm. This ability replaces nimble +1.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feats: </b>At 4th level, and every four levels thereafter, a gunslinger gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained by normal advancement. These bonus feats must be combat or grit feats.</p>
			<p><b>Gun Training (Ex): </b>Starting at 5th level, a gunslinger can select one specific type of firearm (such as an axe musket, blunderbuss, musket, or pistol). She gains a bonus equal to her Dexterity modifier on damage rolls when firing that type of firearm. Furthermore, when she misfires with that type of firearm, the misfire value of that firearm increases by 2 instead of 4.</p>
			<p>Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), the gunslinger picks up another type of firearm, gaining these bonuses for those types as well.</p>
			<p><b>True Grit (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a gunslinger picks two deeds that she has access to and that she must spend grit to perform. She can perform these deeds for 1 grit point fewer (minimum 0) than usual. If the number of grit points to perform a deed is reduced to 0, the gunslinger can perform this deed as long as she has at least 1 grit point. If a deed could already be performed as long as she had at least 1 grit point, she can now perform that deed even when she has no grit points.</p>

While a gun tank&#146;s resolve does not stack with the fortification armor special ability, it does work in concert with that armor special ability or similar effects, so a gun tank can use this ability even after the armor of fortification has failed to negate the critical hit or sneak attack damage. This deed replaces the gunslinger&#146;s dodge deed.</p>
					<p>Gun Tank&#146;s Resilience (Ex): At 15th level, when the gun tank has at least 1 grit point and makes a successful Fortitude saving throw against an attack that would deal half damage or have a partial effect, she takes no damage or other effects from that attack. Furthermore, she gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against fear and mind-affecting effects. This deed replaces the evasive deed.</p>

While a gun tank&#146;s resolve does not stack with the fortification armor special ability, it does work in concert with that armor special ability or similar effects, so a gun tank can use this ability even after the armor of fortification has failed to negate the critical hit or sneak attack damage.

					<p>Gun Tank&#146;s Resilience (Ex): At 15th level, when the gun tank has at least 1 grit point and makes a successful Fortitude saving throw against an attack that would deal half damage or have a partial effect, she takes no damage or other effects from that attack.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Gunslingers usually don&#146;t use heavy armor, but there are a few who use and modify their armor to protect themselves from both traditional weapons and gunfire. These gun tanks trundle into battle with barrels blazing, dealing out punishment with their firearms while knowing few can penetrate their hard protective shells.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For a renegade few, battle sounds different than it does for the typical fighter. The clash of steel and the sizzle of spell energy are drowned out by the thunderous rhythm of gunfire&#151;the pounding beat of the gunslinger.</p>
			<p>Gunslingers are a bold and mysterious lot. While many treat the secrets of black powder with the same care and reverence that a wizard typically reserves for his spellbook, most gunslingers know that firearms are a secret that cannot remain concealed forever. While current firearms are simple, often imprecise, and even dangerous devices, they are a technology on the move, and one that will become even more powerful when it is fully fused with magic.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Gunslingers are thunderous artillery, often found where the fighting is fiercest. Brave, clever, and frequently foolhardy, many gunslingers push to position themselves at close range, barrels blazing, to take down their foes and demoralize their enemies. Other gunslingers are masters of distant death, picking off enemies from afar with their strange and wondrous weapons.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Gunslinger's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A gun tank is proficient with all armors and shields, including tower shields.</p>
			<p><b>Gunsmith: </b>At 1st level, a gunslinger gains one of the following firearms of her choice: blunderbuss, musket, or pistol. Her starting weapon is battered, and only she knows how to use it properly. All other creatures treat her gun as if it had the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it does not work at all for anyone else trying to use it. This starting weapon can only be sold for scrap (it's worth 4d10 gp when sold). The gunslinger also gains Gunsmithing as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Grit (Ex): </b>A gunslinger makes her mark upon the world with daring deeds. Some gunslingers claim they belong to a mystical way of the gun, but it's more likely that the volatile nature of firearms simply prunes the unlucky and careless from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all gunslingers have grit. In game terms, grit is a fluctuating measure of a gunslinger's ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a gunslinger gains a number of grit points equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Her grit goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), though some feats and magic items may affect this maximum. A gunslinger spends grit to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains grit in the following ways.</p>
			<p><b>Critical Hit with a Firearm: </b>Each time the gunslinger confirms a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level does not restore grit.</p>
			<p><b>Killing Blow with a Firearm: </b>When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.</p>
			<p><b>Deeds: </b>Gunslingers spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.</p>
			<p>A gun tank swaps a pair of deeds for the following. The new deed descriptions include information on which deeds from the gunslinger class feature these new deeds replace.</p>
			<p><i>Gun Tank&#146;s Resolve (Ex): </i>At 1st level, the gun tank can shrug off the most serious of attacks. When the gun tank is wearing medium or heavy armor and is subject to a critical hit or sneak attack, she can spend 1 grit point as an immediate action to attempt to negate the critical hit or sneak attack damage. At 1st level, she has a 25% chance of doing so. At 10th level, the chance increases to 50%. At 15th level, the chance increases to 75%. While a gun tank&#146;s resolve does not stack with the fortification armor special ability, it does work in concert with that armor special ability or similar effects, so a gun tank can use this ability even after the armor of fortification has failed to negate the critical hit or sneak attack damage. This deed replaces the gunslinger&#146;s dodge deed.</p>
			<p><i>Gun Tank&#146;s Resilience (Ex): </i>At 15th level, when the gun tank has at least 1 grit point and makes a successful Fortitude saving throw against an attack that would deal half damage or have a partial effect, she takes no damage or other effects from that attack. Furthermore, she gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against fear and mind-affecting effects. This deed replaces the evasive deed.</p>
			<p><b>Bullet Defection (Ex): </b>A gun tank is adept at modifying and using her armor to stop firearm attacks. Starting at 2nd level, a gun tank wearing medium or heavy armor gains half the armor&#146;s bonus plus the armor&#146;s enhancement bonus (if any) as a deflection bonus against any non-siege firearm or splash weapon attack (including the alchemist&#146;s bomb class ability). This ability has no affect on spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities that make a touch attack. This ability replaces nimble.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Training (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a gun tank learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever she is wearing armor, the armor check penalty is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by her armor increases by 1. Every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and 16th), the bonus increases by 1, to a maximum of a &#150;4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase to the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed. This ability stacks with the fighter class ability of the same name. If the gun tank has both class features, she takes the most advantageous benefit of the two class features. This ability replaces the bonus feats the gunslinger gains at 4th level and every four levels thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Gun Training (Ex): </b>Starting at 5th level, a gunslinger can select one specific type of firearm (such as an axe musket, blunderbuss, musket, or pistol). She gains a bonus equal to her Dexterity modifier on damage rolls when firing that type of firearm. Furthermore, when she misfires with that type of firearm, the misfire value of that firearm increases by 2 instead of 4.</p>
			<p>Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), the gunslinger picks up another type of firearm, gaining these bonuses for those types as well.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feats: </b>At 20th level, a gunslinger gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained by normal advancement. These bonus feats must be combat or grit feats.</p>
			<p><b>True Grit (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a gunslinger picks two deeds that she has access to and that she must spend grit to perform. She can perform these deeds for 1 grit point fewer (minimum 0) than usual. If the number of grit points to perform a deed is reduced to 0, the gunslinger can perform this deed as long as she has at least 1 grit point. If a deed could already be performed as long as she had at least 1 grit point, she can now perform that deed even when she has no grit points.</p>

					<p>At 1st level, a gunslinger gains one of the following firearms of her choice: blunderbuss, musket, or pistol. Her starting weapon is battered, and only she knows how to use it properly. All other creatures treat her gun as if it had the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it does not work at all for anyone else trying to use it. This starting weapon can only be sold for scrap (it's worth 4d10 gp when sold). The gunslinger also gains Gunsmithing as a bonus feat.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A gunslinger makes her mark upon the world with daring deeds. Some gunslingers claim they belong to a mystical way of the gun, but it's more likely that the volatile nature of firearms simply prunes the unlucky and careless from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all gunslingers have grit. In game terms, grit is a fluctuating measure of a gunslinger's ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a gunslinger gains a number of grit points equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Her grit goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), though some feats and magic items may affect this maximum. A gunslinger spends grit to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains grit in the following ways.</p>
					<p><i>Critical Hit with a Firearm: </i>Each time the gunslinger confirms a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level does not restore grit.</p>
					<p><i>Killing Blow with a Firearm: </i>When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.</p>

					<p>Gunslingers spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.</p>
					<p>A gun scavenger gains the following deeds at the listed level.</p>
					<p>Change Out (Ex): At 1st level, as a full-round action, a gun scavenger can remove the broken condition from a single firearm she is currently wielding, as long as that condition was gained by a firearm misfire. When she does, she can replace the broken part with a specialized, short-lived component that does one of the following: gives the firearm the scatter weapon quality (Ultimate Combat 137); increases the damage dealt by the pistolwhip deed by one die size; or increases the firearm&#146;s range increment by 10 feet. A firearm with such a modification increases its misfire chance cumulatively by 1 each time it is fired until it misfires. When it does misfire, the effects of the temporary component are lost. A gun scavenger must have at least 1 grit point to perform this deed. Alternatively, if the gun scavenger spends 1 grit point to perform a change out, she can either perform the change out as a standard action instead of a full-round action, or perform the change out on a firearm that isn&#146;t broken. This deed replaces the quick clear deed.</p>
					<p>Jury-Rig (Ex): At 7th level, as a standard action, a gun scavenger can adjust a firearm she is currently wielding to fire in an unconventional way. She can spend 1 grit point to grant her firearm one of the following magic weapon enhancements for 1 round per gunslinger level: distance, flaming, glameredUE, or thundering. If she spends 2 grit points, she can instead grant the firearm flaming burst or stalkingUE. Multiple uses of this ability don&#146;t stack with themselves. This deed replaces the targeting deed.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Although Alkenstar is the center of firearm production and innovation in the Inner Sea, the crack of flint and tang of gun smoke is enough to inspire enthusiasts elsewhere to try their hand at making their own guns using intuition instead of blueprints. A gun scavenger collects scraps, spare parts, and other components that might&#151;if modified properly&#151;give her firearm an extra edge.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For a renegade few, battle sounds different than it does for the typical fighter. The clash of steel and the sizzle of spell energy are drowned out by the thunderous rhythm of gunfire&#151;the pounding beat of the gunslinger.</p>
			<p>Gunslingers are a bold and mysterious lot. While many treat the secrets of black powder with the same care and reverence that a wizard typically reserves for his spellbook, most gunslingers know that firearms are a secret that cannot remain concealed forever. While current firearms are simple, often imprecise, and even dangerous devices, they are a technology on the move, and one that will become even more powerful when it is fully fused with magic.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Gunslingers are thunderous artillery, often found where the fighting is fiercest. Brave, clever, and frequently foolhardy, many gunslingers push to position themselves at close range, barrels blazing, to take down their foes and demoralize their enemies. Other gunslingers are masters of distant death, picking off enemies from afar with their strange and wondrous weapons.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Gunslinger's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Gunslingers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with all firearms. They are proficient with all light armor.</p>
			<p><b>Gunsmith: </b>The gun scavenger&#146;s starting weapon is a mishmash of pieces that even other gunpowder enthusiasts fail to comprehend. Anyone other than the gun scavenger treats her starting weapon as broken, even if she uses the Gunsmithing feat (Ultimate Combat 103) to repair it. This ability works in all other ways like the gunslinger&#146;s gunsmith class feature.This starting weapon can only be sold for scrap (it's worth 4d10 gp when sold). The gunslinger also gains Gunsmithing as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Grit (Ex): </b>A gunslinger makes her mark upon the world with daring deeds. Some gunslingers claim they belong to a mystical way of the gun, but it's more likely that the volatile nature of firearms simply prunes the unlucky and careless from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all gunslingers have grit. In game terms, grit is a fluctuating measure of a gunslinger's ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a gunslinger gains a number of grit points equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Her grit goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), though some feats and magic items may affect this maximum. A gunslinger spends grit to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains grit in the following ways.</p>
			<p><b>Critical Hit with a Firearm: </b>Each time the gunslinger confirms a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level does not restore grit.</p>
			<p><b>Killing Blow with a Firearm: </b>When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.</p>
			<p><b>Go By Feel (Ex): </b>A gun scavenger&#146;s intuitive and unique style leaves her firearms prone to misfire, whether as a result of using too much powder, using imperfectly milled parts, or any number of other minor inconsistencies. When using a firearm, a gun scavenger cannot reduce that firearm&#146;s misfire chance to 0; it can always misfire on a natural 1.</p>
			<p><b>Deeds: </b>Gunslingers spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.</p>
			<p>A gun scavenger gains the following deeds at the listed level.</p>
			<p><i>Change Out (Ex): </i>At 1st level, as a full-round action, a gun scavenger can remove the broken condition from a single firearm she is currently wielding, as long as that condition was gained by a firearm misfire. When she does, she can replace the broken part with a specialized, short-lived component that does one of the following: gives the firearm the scatter weapon quality (Ultimate Combat 137); increases the damage dealt by the pistolwhip deed by one die size; or increases the firearm&#146;s range increment by 10 feet. A firearm with such a modification increases its misfire chance cumulatively by 1 each time it is fired until it misfires. When it does misfire, the effects of the temporary component are lost. A gun scavenger must have at least 1 grit point to perform this deed. Alternatively, if the gun scavenger spends 1 grit point to perform a change out, she can either perform the change out as a standard action instead of a full-round action, or perform the change out on a firearm that isn&#146;t broken. This deed replaces the quick clear deed.</p>
			<p><i>Jury-Rig (Ex): </i>At 7th level, as a standard action, a gun scavenger can adjust a firearm she is currently wielding to fire in an unconventional way. She can spend 1 grit point to grant her firearm one of the following magic weapon enhancements for 1 round per gunslinger level: distance, flaming, glameredUE, or thundering. If she spends 2 grit points, she can instead grant the firearm flaming burst or stalkingUE. Multiple uses of this ability don&#146;t stack with themselves. This deed replaces the targeting deed.</p>
			<p><b>Arbitrary Aim (Ex): </b>Starting at 2nd level, a gun scavenger&#146;s attacks with firearms are difficult to predict. When shooting a firearm at a creature that has a dodge or insight bonus to its Armor Class, the gun scavenger treats the combined bonus as if it were 1 lower. This value increases by 1 for every 4 levels beyond 2nd level (to a maximum of 5 at 20th level). This ability replaces nimble.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feats: </b>At 4th level, and every four levels thereafter, a gunslinger gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained by normal advancement. These bonus feats must be combat or grit feats.</p>
			<p><b>Gun Training (Ex): </b>Starting at 5th level, a gunslinger can select one specific type of firearm (such as an axe musket, blunderbuss, musket, or pistol). She gains a bonus equal to her Dexterity modifier on damage rolls when firing that type of firearm. Furthermore, when she misfires with that type of firearm, the misfire value of that firearm increases by 2 instead of 4.</p>
			<p>Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), the gunslinger picks up another type of firearm, gaining these bonuses for those types as well.</p>
			<p><b>True Grit (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a gunslinger picks two deeds that she has access to and that she must spend grit to perform. She can perform these deeds for 1 grit point fewer (minimum 0) than usual. If the number of grit points to perform a deed is reduced to 0, the gunslinger can perform this deed as long as she has at least 1 grit point. If a deed could already be performed as long as she had at least 1 grit point, she can now perform that deed even when she has no grit points.</p>

					<p>At 1st level, a gunslinger gains one of the following firearms of her choice: blunderbuss, musket, or pistol. Her starting weapon is battered, and only she knows how to use it properly. All other creatures treat her gun as if it had the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it does not work at all for anyone else trying to use it. This starting weapon can only be sold for scrap (it's worth 4d10 gp when sold). The gunslinger also gains Gunsmithing as a bonus feat.</p>

					<p><i>Daring Adjacent Shot: </i>The first time each round the gulch gunner makes a ranged firearm attack against an adjacent foe and provokes an attack of opportunity, she regains 1 grit point. Making an adjacent firearm attack against a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gulch gunner&#146;s character level does not restore grit, nor do ranged attacks using some ability that prevents the gulch gunner from provoking an attack of opportunity.

					<p>A gulch gunner has some unique deeds, which replace some of the standard gunslinger deeds as listed in each entry. These deeds follow all the general rules and restrictions of gunslinger deeds.</p>
					<p>Flash and Shock (Ex): At 1st level, the gulch gunner can take advantage of the flash and sound of a firearm to throw off an attacker&#146;s aim at close range. When she makes an attack against a foe within her firearm&#146;s first range increment, she may spend 1 grit point to gain a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against that opponent until the beginning of her next turn. She can only perform this deed while wearing medium, light, or no armor, and while carrying no more than a light load. This deed replaces the deadeye deed.</p>
					<p>Powder Burns (Ex): At 3rd level, the gulch gunner learns to maximize the damage dealt by a firearm at extremely close range. When the gulch gunner successfully hits an adjacent foe with a ranged firearm attack, she may spend 1 grit point to deal an additional 1d6 points of fire damage from the muzzle flash of her weapon. The target must also make a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the gulch gunner&#146;s level + the gulch gunner&#146;s Wisdom modifier) or catch on fire. This deed replaces the pistol whip deed.</p>
					<p>Staggering Shot (Ex): At 15th level, when the gulch gunner hits an adjacent target with a ranged firearm attack, the target must also make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the gulch gunner&#146;s level + the gulch gunner&#146;s Wisdom modifier) or be staggered for 1d4 rounds. This deed replaces the menacing shot deed.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Ratfolk warfare often occurs in cramped, claustrophobic spaces such as the ratfolk&#146;s own underground warrens and heavily trapped gulch fortresses, or the subterranean tunnels of goblins and similar foes. Since these battlegrounds often have tight corners and few areas with long lines of sight, those ratfolk who seek to master the use of firearms almost inevitably become experts in close-quarters combat. These gulch gunners often specialize in proficiency with a single pistol (easily handled in tight spaces) and wander from warren to warren selling their tunnel-shooting skills to the highest bidder. A gulch gunner has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For a renegade few, battle sounds different than it does for the typical fighter. The clash of steel and the sizzle of spell energy are drowned out by the thunderous rhythm of gunfire&#151;the pounding beat of the gunslinger.</p>
			<p>Gunslingers are a bold and mysterious lot. While many treat the secrets of black powder with the same care and reverence that a wizard typically reserves for his spellbook, most gunslingers know that firearms are a secret that cannot remain concealed forever. While current firearms are simple, often imprecise, and even dangerous devices, they are a technology on the move, and one that will become even more powerful when it is fully fused with magic.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Gunslingers are thunderous artillery, often found where the fighting is fiercest. Brave, clever, and frequently foolhardy, many gunslingers push to position themselves at close range, barrels blazing, to take down their foes and demoralize their enemies. Other gunslingers are masters of distant death, picking off enemies from afar with their strange and wondrous weapons.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Race: </b>Rat Folk Only</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Gunslinger's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Disable Device (Dex), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), and Survival (Wis).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Gunslingers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with all firearms. They are proficient with all light armor.</p>
			<p><b>Gunsmith: </b>At 1st level, a gunslinger gains one of the following firearms of her choice: blunderbuss, musket, or pistol. Her starting weapon is battered, and only she knows how to use it properly. All other creatures treat her gun as if it had the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it does not work at all for anyone else trying to use it. This starting weapon can only be sold for scrap (it's worth 4d10 gp when sold). The gunslinger also gains Gunsmithing as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Grit (Ex): </b>A gunslinger makes her mark upon the world with daring deeds. Some gunslingers claim they belong to a mystical way of the gun, but it's more likely that the volatile nature of firearms simply prunes the unlucky and careless from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all gunslingers have grit. In game terms, grit is a fluctuating measure of a gunslinger's ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a gunslinger gains a number of grit points equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Her grit goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), though some feats and magic items may affect this maximum. A gunslinger spends grit to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains grit in the following ways.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, a gulch gunner gains grit as a standard gunslinger. However, the close-combat focus of the gulch gunner results in a slightly different set of circumstances for regaining grit.</p>
			<p><i>Daring Adjacent Shot: </i>The first time each round the gulch gunner makes a ranged firearm attack against an adjacent foe and provokes an attack of opportunity, she regains 1 grit point. Making an adjacent firearm attack against a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gulch gunner&#146;s character level does not restore grit, nor do ranged attacks using some ability that prevents the gulch gunner from provoking an attack of opportunity. This ability replaces the ability to regain grit from a critical hit with a firearm.</p>
			<p><i>Killing Blow with a Firearm: </i>When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.</p>
			<p><b>Deeds: </b>Gunslingers spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.</p>
			<p>A gulch gunner has some unique deeds, which replace some of the standard gunslinger deeds as listed in each entry. These deeds follow all the general rules and restrictions of gunslinger deeds.</p>
			<p><i>Flash and Shock (Ex): </i>At 1st level, the gulch gunner can take advantage of the flash and sound of a firearm to throw off an attacker&#146;s aim at close range. When she makes an attack against a foe within her firearm&#146;s first range increment, she may spend 1 grit point to gain a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against that opponent until the beginning of her next turn. She can only perform this deed while wearing medium, light, or no armor, and while carrying no more than a light load. This deed replaces the deadeye deed.</p>
			<p><i>Powder Burns (Ex): </i>At 3rd level, the gulch gunner learns to maximize the damage dealt by a firearm at extremely close range. When the gulch gunner successfully hits an adjacent foe with a ranged firearm attack, she may spend 1 grit point to deal an additional 1d6 points of fire damage from the muzzle flash of her weapon. The target must also make a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the gulch gunner&#146;s level + the gulch gunner&#146;s Wisdom modifier) or catch on fire. This deed replaces the pistol whip deed.</p>
			<p><i>Staggering Shot (Ex): </i>At 15th level, when the gulch gunner hits an adjacent target with a ranged firearm attack, the target must also make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the gulch gunner&#146;s level + the gulch gunner&#146;s Wisdom modifier) or be staggered for 1d4 rounds. This deed replaces the menacing shot deed.</p>
			<p><b>Nimble (Ex): </b>Starting at 2nd level, a gunslinger gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC while wearing light or no armor. Anything that causes the gunslinger to lose her Dexterity bonus to AC also causes the gunslinger to lose this dodge bonus. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd level (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level).</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feats: </b>At 4th level, and every four levels thereafter, a gunslinger gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained by normal advancement. These bonus feats must be combat or grit feats.</p>
			<p><b>Gun Training (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a gunslinger can select one specific type of firearm (such as an axe musket, blunderbuss, musket, or pistol). She gains a bonus equal to her Dexterity modifier on damage rolls when firing that type of firearm. Furthermore, when she misfires with that type of firearm, the misfire value of that firearm increases by 2 instead of 4.</p>
			<p><b>Belly Shot (Ex): </b>At 9th level, a gulch gunner can press her firearm directly against a vulnerable location of an adjacent target, dealing additional damage. When the gulch gunner successfully hits an adjacent target with a ranged firearm attack, she deals +1d6 points of damage. This damage increases to +2d6 at 13th level and to +3d6 at 17th level. Creatures immune to precision damage, critical hits, or sneak attacks do not take this additional damage. This ability replaces the gun training ability gained at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.</p>
			<p><b>True Grit (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a gunslinger picks two deeds that she has access to and that she must spend grit to perform. She can perform these deeds for 1 grit point fewer (minimum 0) than usual. If the number of grit points to perform a deed is reduced to 0, the gunslinger can perform this deed as long as she has at least 1 grit point. If a deed could already be performed as long as she had at least 1 grit point, she can now perform that deed even when she has no grit points.</p>

					<p>A graveslinger gains the following deeds.</p>
					<p>Ghostbane Shot (Ex): At 1st level, once per day by spending 10 minutes to combine mundane ammunition with a mixture of grave dirt and powdered bone, the graveslinger can prepare a number of special bullets equal to her graveslinger level plus her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). When attacking incorporeal undead, these bullets are treated as if they had the ghost touch special ability. These bullets function only for the graveslinger, and if not fired within 24 hours, the bullets become inert, losing their ghost touch special ability. This deed replaces the deadeye deed.</p>
					<p>Ectoplasmic Anchor (Su): At 7th level, an incorporeal undead creature hit by one of the graveslinger's ghostbane shots becomes infused with ectoplasm, interfering with its defenses and mobility. The creature must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half the graveslinger's level + the graveslinger's Wisdom modifier) or become semicorporeal for 1 round. A semicorporeal creature takes half damage (50%) from nonmagical attack forms, and it takes full damage from magic weapons, spells, spell-like effects, and supernatural effects. During this time, it cannot enter or pass through solid objects. This deed replaces the startling shot deed.</p>
					<p>Undead Hunter (Ex): At 11th level, the graveslinger's ghostbane shots are treated as if they also had the undead bane special ability. This deed replaces the bleeding wound deed.</p>
					<p>Staggering Shot (Ex): At 15th level, when a graveslinger confirms a critical hit against an undead creature with one of her ghostbane shots, the creature is staggered for 1 round. This deed replaces the menacing shot deed.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Graveslingers craft signature bullets to hunt down wandering undead. With this infused ammunition, they can take on the most resilient spectral foes with ease.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For a renegade few, battle sounds different than it does for the typical fighter. The clash of steel and the sizzle of spell energy are drowned out by the thunderous rhythm of gunfire&#151;the pounding beat of the gunslinger.</p>
			<p>Gunslingers are a bold and mysterious lot. While many treat the secrets of black powder with the same care and reverence that a wizard typically reserves for his spellbook, most gunslingers know that firearms are a secret that cannot remain concealed forever. While current firearms are simple, often imprecise, and even dangerous devices, they are a technology on the move, and one that will become even more powerful when it is fully fused with magic.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Gunslingers are thunderous artillery, often found where the fighting is fiercest. Brave, clever, and frequently foolhardy, many gunslingers push to position themselves at close range, barrels blazing, to take down their foes and demoralize their enemies. Other gunslingers are masters of distant death, picking off enemies from afar with their strange and wondrous weapons.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Gunslinger's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Gunslingers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with all firearms. They are proficient with all light armor.</p>
			<p><b>Gunsmith: </b>At 1st level, a gunslinger gains one of the following firearms of her choice: blunderbuss, musket, or pistol. Her starting weapon is battered, and only she knows how to use it properly. All other creatures treat her gun as if it had the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it does not work at all for anyone else trying to use it. This starting weapon can only be sold for scrap (it's worth 4d10 gp when sold). The gunslinger also gains Gunsmithing as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Grit (Ex): </b>A gunslinger makes her mark upon the world with daring deeds. Some gunslingers claim they belong to a mystical way of the gun, but it's more likely that the volatile nature of firearms simply prunes the unlucky and careless from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all gunslingers have grit. In game terms, grit is a fluctuating measure of a gunslinger's ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a gunslinger gains a number of grit points equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Her grit goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), though some feats and magic items may affect this maximum. A gunslinger spends grit to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains grit in the following ways.</p>
			<p><i>Critical Hit with a Firearm: </i>Each time the gunslinger confirms a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level does not restore grit.</p>
			<p><i>Killing Blow with a Firearm: </i>When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.</p>
			<p><b>Deeds: </b>Gunslingers spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.</p>
			<p>A graveslinger gains the following deeds.</p>
			<p><i>Ghostbane Shot (Ex): </i>At 1st level, once per day by spending 10 minutes to combine mundane ammunition with a mixture of grave dirt and powdered bone, the graveslinger can prepare a number of special bullets equal to her graveslinger level plus her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). When attacking incorporeal undead, these bullets are treated as if they had the ghost touch special ability. These bullets function only for the graveslinger, and if not fired within 24 hours, the bullets become inert, losing their ghost touch special ability. This deed replaces the deadeye deed.</p>
			<p><i>Ectoplasmic Anchor (Su): </i>At 7th level, an incorporeal undead creature hit by one of the graveslinger's ghostbane shots becomes infused with ectoplasm, interfering with its defenses and mobility. The creature must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half the graveslinger's level + the graveslinger's Wisdom modifier) or become semicorporeal for 1 round. A semicorporeal creature takes half damage (50%) from nonmagical attack forms, and it takes full damage from magic weapons, spells, spell-like effects, and supernatural effects. During this time, it cannot enter or pass through solid objects. This deed replaces the startling shot deed.</p>
			<p><i>Undead Hunter (Ex): </i>At 11th level, the graveslinger's ghostbane shots are treated as if they also had the undead bane special ability. This deed replaces the bleeding wound deed.</p>
			<p><i>Staggering Shot (Ex): </i>At 15th level, when a graveslinger confirms a critical hit against an undead creature with one of her ghostbane shots, the creature is staggered for 1 round. This deed replaces the menacing shot deed.</p>
			<p><b>Nimble (Ex): </b>Starting at 2nd level, a gunslinger gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC while wearing light or no armor. Anything that causes the gunslinger to lose her Dexterity bonus to AC also causes the gunslinger to lose this dodge bonus. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd level (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level).</p>
			<p><b>Supernatural Awareness (Ex) : </b>At 4th level, the graveslinger gains Blind-Fight as a bonus feat. Additionally, as long as she has 1 grit point, she can always act in surprise rounds that are triggered by haunts and incorporeal undead, even if she fails to notice them.</p>
			<p><b>Gun Training (Ex): </b>Starting at 5th level, a gunslinger can select one specific type of firearm (such as an axe musket, blunderbuss, musket, or pistol). She gains a bonus equal to her Dexterity modifier on damage rolls when firing that type of firearm. Furthermore, when she misfires with that type of firearm, the misfire value of that firearm increases by 2 instead of 4.</p>
			<p>Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), the gunslinger picks up another type of firearm, gaining these bonuses for those types as well.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feats: </b>At 8th level, and every four levels thereafter, a gunslinger gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained by normal advancement. These bonus feats must be combat or grit feats.</p>
			<p><b>True Grit (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a gunslinger picks two deeds that she has access to and that she must spend grit to perform. She can perform these deeds for 1 grit point fewer (minimum 0) than usual. If the number of grit points to perform a deed is reduced to 0, the gunslinger can perform this deed as long as she has at least 1 grit point. If a deed could already be performed as long as she had at least 1 grit point, she can now perform that deed even when she has no grit points.</p>

					<p><i>Killing Blow with a Firearm: </i>When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.</p>

					<p>Gunslingers spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.</p>
					<p>A commando gains the following deeds; each of these deeds replaces an existing deed.</p>
					<p>Trap Shot (Ex): At 3rd level, the commando can spend 1 point of grit and target a 5-foot square with her firearm. If she succeeds at an attack against an AC of 10, she triggers a single trap within that 5-foot square, even if she is unaware of the trap. If there are multiple traps within the same 5-foot square, the commando must declare which trap she is triggering; otherwise it is determined randomly. If a creature is occupying the same square as the triggered trap, the trap affects the creature as if it had triggered the trap. This deed replaces utility shot.</p>
					<p>Sniping Shot (Ex): At 11th level, the commando can spend 1 point of grit as a swift action to negate the &#150;20 penalty on Stealth checks when sniping until the start of her next turn. This deed replaces expert loading.</p>
					<p>Camouflage (Ex): At 11th level, as long as the commando has 1 point of grit, she gains the camouflage ranger class feature. This deed replaces lightning reload.</p>
					<p>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): At 15th level, as long as the commando has 1 point of grit, she gains the hide in plain sight ranger class feature. This deed replaces slinger&#146;s luck.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Commandos are those rough and ready gunslingers who excel at hit-and-run tactics and leveraging their expertise in the wild against their enemies.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For a renegade few, battle sounds different than it does for the typical fighter. The clash of steel and the sizzle of spell energy are drowned out by the thunderous rhythm of gunfire&#151;the pounding beat of the gunslinger.</p>
			<p>Gunslingers are a bold and mysterious lot. While many treat the secrets of black powder with the same care and reverence that a wizard typically reserves for his spellbook, most gunslingers know that firearms are a secret that cannot remain concealed forever. While current firearms are simple, often imprecise, and even dangerous devices, they are a technology on the move, and one that will become even more powerful when it is fully fused with magic.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Gunslingers are thunderous artillery, often found where the fighting is fiercest. Brave, clever, and frequently foolhardy, many gunslingers push to position themselves at close range, barrels blazing, to take down their foes and demoralize their enemies. Other gunslingers are masters of distant death, picking off enemies from afar with their strange and wondrous weapons.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Gunslinger's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Gunslingers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with all firearms. They are proficient with all light armor.</p>
			<p><b>Gunsmith: </b>At 1st level, a gunslinger gains one of the following firearms of her choice: blunderbuss, musket, or pistol. Her starting weapon is battered, and only she knows how to use it properly. All other creatures treat her gun as if it had the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it does not work at all for anyone else trying to use it. This starting weapon can only be sold for scrap (it's worth 4d10 gp when sold). The gunslinger also gains Gunsmithing as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Grit (Ex): </b>A gunslinger makes her mark upon the world with daring deeds. Some gunslingers claim they belong to a mystical way of the gun, but it's more likely that the volatile nature of firearms simply prunes the unlucky and careless from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all gunslingers have grit. In game terms, grit is a fluctuating measure of a gunslinger's ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a gunslinger gains a number of grit points equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Her grit goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), though some feats and magic items may affect this maximum. A gunslinger spends grit to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains grit in the following ways.</p>
			<p><i>Critical Hit with a Firearm: </i>Each time the gunslinger confirms a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level does not restore grit.</p>
			<p><i>Killing Blow with a Firearm: </i>When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.</p>
			<p><b>Deeds: </b>Gunslingers spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.</p>
			<p>A commando gains the following deeds; each of these deeds replaces an existing deed.</p>
			<p>Trap Shot (Ex): At 3rd level, the commando can spend 1 point of grit and target a 5-foot square with her firearm. If she succeeds at an attack against an AC of 10, she triggers a single trap within that 5-foot square, even if she is unaware of the trap. If there are multiple traps within the same 5-foot square, the commando must declare which trap she is triggering; otherwise it is determined randomly. If a creature is occupying the same square as the triggered trap, the trap affects the creature as if it had triggered the trap. This deed replaces utility shot.</p>
			<p>Sniping Shot (Ex): At 11th level, the commando can spend 1 point of grit as a swift action to negate the &#150;20 penalty on Stealth checks when sniping until the start of her next turn. This deed replaces expert loading.</p>
			<p>Camouflage (Ex): At 11th level, as long as the commando has 1 point of grit, she gains the camouflage ranger class feature. This deed replaces lightning reload.</p>
			<p>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): At 15th level, as long as the commando has 1 point of grit, she gains the hide in plain sight ranger class feature. This deed replaces slinger&#146;s luck.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a commando gains the favored terrain ranger class feature. At 6th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the commando can pick an additional favored terrain.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a commando adds half her level on Survival checks to follow tracks. This replaces the bonus feat gained at 4th level.</p>
			<p><b>Gun Training (Ex): </b>Starting at 5th level, a gunslinger can select one specific type of firearm (such as an axe musket, blunderbuss, musket, or pistol). She gains a bonus equal to her Dexterity modifier on damage rolls when firing that type of firearm. Furthermore, when she misfires with that type of firearm, the misfire value of that firearm increases by 2 instead of 4.</p>
			<p>Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), the gunslinger picks up another type of firearm, gaining these bonuses for those types as well.</p>
			<p><b>Trapsmith: </b>At 5th level, a commando can learn how to create one ranger trap in place of gaining the next level of gun training. A commando can use a known trap a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom bonus (minimum 1). The DC for a commando&#146;s trap is equal to 10 + half her commando level + her Wisdom bonus, and it lasts 1 day per 2 levels she has. A commando can set only extraordinary ranger traps with this ability; as with extraordinary ranger traps, the trap DC for these traps has a &#150;2 penalty.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feats: </b>At 8th level, and every four levels thereafter, a gunslinger gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained by normal advancement. These bonus feats must be combat or grit feats.</p>
			<p><b>True Grit (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a gunslinger picks two deeds that she has access to and that she must spend grit to perform. She can perform these deeds for 1 grit point fewer (minimum 0) than usual. If the number of grit points to perform a deed is reduced to 0, the gunslinger can perform this deed as long as she has at least 1 grit point. If a deed could already be performed as long as she had at least 1 grit point, she can now perform that deed even when she has no grit points.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Where other gunslingers rely on precision shooting, the firebrand instead masters explosive ordnance. Firebrands tend to be passionate, devil-may-care wanderers living each day to the fullest.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For a renegade few, battle sounds different than it does for the typical fighter. The clash of steel and the sizzle of spell energy are drowned out by the thunderous rhythm of gunfire&#151;the pounding beat of the gunslinger.</p>
			<p>Gunslingers are a bold and mysterious lot. While many treat the secrets of black powder with the same care and reverence that a wizard typically reserves for his spellbook, most gunslingers know that firearms are a secret that cannot remain concealed forever. While current firearms are simple, often imprecise, and even dangerous devices, they are a technology on the move, and one that will become even more powerful when it is fully fused with magic.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Gunslingers are thunderous artillery, often found where the fighting is fiercest. Brave, clever, and frequently foolhardy, many gunslingers push to position themselves at close range, barrels blazing, to take down their foes and demoralize their enemies. Other gunslingers are masters of distant death, picking off enemies from afar with their strange and wondrous weapons.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Gunslinger's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Gunslingers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with all firearms. They are proficient with all light armor.</p>
			<p><b>Gunsmith: </b>At 1st level, a firebrand gains a dragon pistol (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 45) as her battered firearm. Her starting weapon is battered, and only she knows how to use it properly. All other creatures treat her gun as if it had the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it does not work at all for anyone else trying to use it. This starting weapon can only be sold for scrap (it's worth 4d10 gp when sold). The gunslinger also gains Gunsmithing as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Grit (Ex): </b>A gunslinger makes her mark upon the world with daring deeds. Some gunslingers claim they belong to a mystical way of the gun, but it's more likely that the volatile nature of firearms simply prunes the unlucky and careless from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all gunslingers have grit. In game terms, grit is a fluctuating measure of a gunslinger's ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a gunslinger gains a number of grit points equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Her grit goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), though some feats and magic items may affect this maximum. A gunslinger spends grit to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains grit in the following ways.</p>
			<p><i>Critical Hit with a Firearm: </i>Each time the gunslinger confirms a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level does not restore grit.</p>
			<p><i>Killing Blow with a Firearm: </i>When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.</p>
			<p><b>Deeds: </b>Gunslingers spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.</p>
			<p>A firebrand gains the following deeds.</p>
			<p><i>Dragon Fire (Ex): </i>A firebrand is a master of the volatile substance known as dragon&#146;s breath. At 1st level, as a swift action, the firebrand can spend 1 grit point to add her Charisma modifier to the DCs of all dragon&#146;s breath cartridges (Ultimate Equipment 42) she fires until the end of her turn. Her attacks with dragon&#146;s breath cartridges misfire only if a 1 is rolled on two or more of the damage dice. This deed replaces the deadeye deed.</p>
			<p><i>Big Boom! (Su): </i>At 7th level, a firebrand can channel her explosive potential into a mighty blast. As a standard action, the firebrand shoots a 30-foot cone of fire from the barrel of her gun. The firebrand designates one creature in the squares affected by the cone to be the target and makes an attack roll with her firearm against that creature; on a hit, the target takes damage as if it were directly hit by both the firebrand&#146;s firearm and her bomb. Creatures in all other squares in the cone (as well as the target&#146;s square, if the gunslinger&#146;s attack missed) take splash damage as if they were in the area of the firebrand&#146;s bomb, with a Reflex saving throw for half damage. (The DC of this saving throw is equal to 10 + half the firebrand&#146;s gunslinger level + the firebrand&#146;s Charisma modifier.) Using this deed costs 2 grit points and expends one of the firebrand&#146;s daily uses of bombs (see the bombs ability on page 5), as well as the appropriate ammunition for the firearm attack; ammunition that does not require an attack roll cannot be used this way. This deed replaces the dead shot deed.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Card (Ex): </b>A firebrand uses her Charisma instead of Wisdom to determine the number of grit points she gains at the start of each day and to determine the DCs of her gunslinger deeds. A firebrand treats direct hits with her bombs as firearm attacks for the purpose of regaining grit (see the bombs ability on page 5). This ability works in all other ways like the gunslinger&#146;s grit class feature. This ability alters grit.</p>
			<p><b>Nimble (Ex): </b>Starting at 2nd level, a gunslinger gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC while wearing light or no armor. Anything that causes the gunslinger to lose her Dexterity bonus to AC also causes the gunslinger to lose this dodge bonus. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd level (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level).</p>
			<p><b>Scorched Earth (Ex): </b>The firebrand knows how to make dragon&#146;s breath burn white-hot. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the fire damage of the first dragon&#146;s breath cartridge fired by the firebrand each round increases by 1d6 (to a maximum total of 7d6 at 20th level).</p>
			<p><b>Bombs (Su): </b>At 5th level, the firebrand gains the bombs ability as an alchemist of her gunslinger level &#150; 4, using her Charisma modifier in place of her Intelligence modifier to determine her number of bombs per day and the DC to avoid splash damage. The firebrand adds her Charisma modifier to her bombs&#146; damage instead of her Intelligence modifier, even if she has the throw anything class feature. In addition, the firebrand&#146;s bombs are always under the effect of the explosive bombs discovery. Firebrand levels do not stack with levels in other classes with the bombs class feature.</p>
			<p><b>True Grit (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a gunslinger picks two deeds that she has access to and that she must spend grit to perform. She can perform these deeds for 1 grit point fewer (minimum 0) than usual. If the number of grit points to perform a deed is reduced to 0, the gunslinger can perform this deed as long as she has at least 1 grit point. If a deed could already be performed as long as she had at least 1 grit point, she can now perform that deed even when she has no grit points.</p>

					<p>A gunslinger makes her mark upon the world with daring deeds. Some gunslingers claim they belong to a mystical way of the gun, but it's more likely that the volatile nature of firearms simply prunes the unlucky and careless from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all gunslingers have grit. In game terms, grit is a fluctuating measure of a gunslinger's ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a gunslinger gains a number of grit points equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Her grit goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), though some feats and magic items may affect this maximum. A gunslinger spends grit to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains grit in the following ways.</p>
					<p><i>Critical Hit with a Firearm: </i>Each time the gunslinger confirms a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level does not restore grit.</p>
					<p><i>Killing Blow with a Firearm: </i>When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>An experimental gunsmith starts play with one innovation she can make to her experimental firearms, selected from the list below. This innovation is a radical change to the typical design of a firearm, and comes with both additional benefits and noteworthy drawbacks. The experimental gunsmith can maintain only one experimental firearm modified with one or more innovations, as it requires constant adjustments and much of her time is spent maintaining the weapon. If the experimental gunsmith takes the Gunsmithing feat, she can create other firearms using a single innovation she knows (or add one innovation to an existing firearm), though such weapons become unreliable over time. The misfire value of such weapons increases by 1 for each week after its creation, although the experimental gunsmith can return the misfire rate to normal by spending 1 day maintaining the weapon and spending 50 gp in raw materials. For the purposes of crafting such firearms, each innovation is treated as the masterwork weapon quality (with a value of 300 gp).</p>
					<p>At 5th level, and every four levels after that (9th, 13th, and 17th level), the experimental gunsmith learns one additional innovation from the list below. These represent constant and increasingly skilled tinkering with a single firearm in her possession, and when the experimental gunsmith gains an innovation, she may immediately apply it to her experimental firearm. Once an innovation has been selected, it cannot be changed. This ability replaces gun training.</p>
					<p>Expanded Capacity: The experimental gunsmith increases her firearm&#146;s capacity by one (generally by adding another barrel, depending on the weapon&#146;s design). She also increases its weight by 50%. Because of the complexity of increasing its capacity, her weapon is more prone to misfire, and its misfire value increases by 1 (this is in addition to any misfire increase if the weapon is made with the Gunsmithing feat).</p>
					<p>Expanded Chamber: The experimental gunsmith&#146;s firearm has a much larger than normal chamber for black powder, allowing her to use 2 doses of powder with each shot. The weapon grants a +1 circumstance bonus on damage rolls. However, when the weapon misfires, it causes a flashburn. This is the same as the weapon exploding (dealing damage from a corner of the experimental gunsmith&#146;s square), except the weapon is not automatically destroyed. If a broken weapon misfires, it is destroyed as normal.</p>
					<p>Grapple Launcher: The experimental gunsmith&#146;s firearm includes a special set of rails that allows her to slide a grappling hook over the barrel and fire it as a full-round action. The grappling hook anchors into anything she successfully hits with an attack roll, and the DC of the Strength check required to pull the grappling hook loose is equal to her attack roll to lodge it in place. A Disable Device check can remove it with a +5 bonus on the check, and a creature struck by the hook can escape it with a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check with a +5 bonus on the check. The firearm is powerful enough to fire a hook trailing up to 100 feet of rope, but throws off the balance of the experimental gunsmith&#146;s firearm, reducing its range increment by 50%.</p>
					<p>Recoilless: The experimental gunsmith&#146;s firearm includes a series of gears, springs, and pistons designed to reduce its recoil and thus improve accuracy. The range increment of the weapon increases by 10 feet. However, the system is fragile, and easily damaged. Anytime the weapon misfires, this system becomes broken and does not function until the experimental gunsmith spends 1 hour repairing it.</p>
					<p>Vial Launcher: The experimental gunsmith adds a special tube onto her firearm that can hold 1 vial of alchemical material, such as alchemist&#146;s fire, a tanglefoot bag, or a thunderstone. A special trigger allows her to channel the force of black powder into this tube to launch the vial as a ranged attack with half the range increment of her firearm. The experimental gunsmith can take this action in place of any single ranged attack, and may use the same attack bonus that she can apply to the firearm. If the alchemical substance has a save DC, it becomes 10 + 1/2 her experimental gunsmith level + her Wisdom modifier when she launches the vial from her firearm. This increase only applies to the initial saving throw. If additional saving throws are called for, they are resolved as normal. Reloading the tube is a time-consuming process and requires two full-round actions. If the weapon misfires while loaded with an alchemical substance, it detonates with the experimental gunsmith (and the firearm) as the target.</p>

					<p>Expanded Capacity: The experimental gunsmith increases her firearm&#146;s capacity by one (generally by adding another barrel, depending on the weapon&#146;s design). She also increases its weight by 50%. Because of the complexity of increasing its capacity, her weapon is more prone to misfire, and its misfire value increases by 1 (this is in addition to any misfire increase if the weapon is made with the Gunsmithing feat).</p>
					<p>Expanded Chamber: The experimental gunsmith&#146;s firearm has a much larger than normal chamber for black powder, allowing her to use 2 doses of powder with each shot. The weapon grants a +1 circumstance bonus on damage rolls. However, when the weapon misfires, it causes a flashburn. This is the same as the weapon exploding (dealing damage from a corner of the experimental gunsmith&#146;s square), except the weapon is not automatically destroyed. If a broken weapon misfires, it is destroyed as normal.</p>
					<p>Grapple Launcher: The experimental gunsmith&#146;s firearm includes a special set of rails that allows her to slide a grappling hook over the barrel and fire it as a full-round action. The grappling hook anchors into anything she successfully hits with an attack roll, and the DC of the Strength check required to pull the grappling hook loose is equal to her attack roll to lodge it in place. A Disable Device check can remove it with a +5 bonus on the check, and a creature struck by the hook can escape it with a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check with a +5 bonus on the check. The firearm is powerful enough to fire a hook trailing up to 100 feet of rope, but throws off the balance of the experimental gunsmith&#146;s firearm, reducing its range increment by 50%.</p>
					<p>Recoilless: The experimental gunsmith&#146;s firearm includes a series of gears, springs, and pistons designed to reduce its recoil and thus improve accuracy. The range increment of the weapon increases by 10 feet. However, the system is fragile, and easily damaged. Anytime the weapon misfires, this system becomes broken and does not function until the experimental gunsmith spends 1 hour repairing it.</p>
					<p>Vial Launcher: The experimental gunsmith adds a special tube onto her firearm that can hold 1 vial of alchemical material, such as alchemist&#146;s fire, a tanglefoot bag, or a thunderstone. A special trigger allows her to channel the force of black powder into this tube to launch the vial as a ranged attack with half the range increment of her firearm. The experimental gunsmith can take this action in place of any single ranged attack, and may use the same attack bonus that she can apply to the firearm. If the alchemical substance has a save DC, it becomes 10 + 1/2 her experimental gunsmith level + her Wisdom modifier when she launches the vial from her firearm. This increase only applies to the initial saving throw. If additional saving throws are called for, they are resolved as normal. Reloading the tube is a time-consuming process and requires two full-round actions. If the weapon misfires while loaded with an alchemical substance, it detonates with the experimental gunsmith (and the firearm) as the target.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The experimental gunsmith is obsessed with creating the ultimate firearm, and is willing to take risks to work the kinks out of her design. An experimental gunsmith has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For a renegade few, battle sounds different than it does for the typical fighter. The clash of steel and the sizzle of spell energy are drowned out by the thunderous rhythm of gunfire&#151;the pounding beat of the gunslinger.</p>
			<p>Gunslingers are a bold and mysterious lot. While many treat the secrets of black powder with the same care and reverence that a wizard typically reserves for his spellbook, most gunslingers know that firearms are a secret that cannot remain concealed forever. While current firearms are simple, often imprecise, and even dangerous devices, they are a technology on the move, and one that will become even more powerful when it is fully fused with magic.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Gunslingers are thunderous artillery, often found where the fighting is fiercest. Brave, clever, and frequently foolhardy, many gunslingers push to position themselves at close range, barrels blazing, to take down their foes and demoralize their enemies. Other gunslingers are masters of distant death, picking off enemies from afar with their strange and wondrous weapons.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Gunslinger's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>

			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Gunslingers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with all firearms. They are proficient with all light armor.</p>
			<p><b>Gunsmith: </b>At 1st level, a gunslinger gains one of the following firearms of her choice: blunderbuss, musket, or pistol. Her starting weapon is battered, and only she knows how to use it properly. All other creatures treat her gun as if it had the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it does not work at all for anyone else trying to use it. This starting weapon can only be sold for scrap (it's worth 4d10 gp when sold). The gunslinger also gains Gunsmithing as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Grit (Ex): </b>A gunslinger makes her mark upon the world with daring deeds. Some gunslingers claim they belong to a mystical way of the gun, but it's more likely that the volatile nature of firearms simply prunes the unlucky and careless from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all gunslingers have grit. In game terms, grit is a fluctuating measure of a gunslinger's ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a gunslinger gains a number of grit points equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Her grit goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), though some feats and magic items may affect this maximum. A gunslinger spends grit to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains grit in the following ways.</p>
			<p><i>Critical Hit with a Firearm: </i>Each time the gunslinger confirms a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level does not restore grit.</p>
			<p><i>Killing Blow with a Firearm: </i>When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.</p>
			<p><b>Deeds: </b>Gunslingers spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.</p>
			<p><b>Nimble (Ex): </b>Starting at 2nd level, a gunslinger gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC while wearing light or no armor. Anything that causes the gunslinger to lose her Dexterity bonus to AC also causes the gunslinger to lose this dodge bonus. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd level (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level).</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feats: </b>At 4th level, and every four levels thereafter, a gunslinger gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained by normal advancement. These bonus feats must be combat or grit feats.</p>
			<p><b>Innovations (Ex): </b>An experimental gunsmith starts play with one innovation she can make to her experimental firearms, selected from the list below. This innovation is a radical change to the typical design of a firearm, and comes with both additional benefits and noteworthy drawbacks. The experimental gunsmith can maintain only one experimental firearm modified with one or more innovations, as it requires constant adjustments and much of her time is spent maintaining the weapon. If the experimental gunsmith takes the Gunsmithing feat, she can create other firearms using a single innovation she knows (or add one innovation to an existing firearm), though such weapons become unreliable over time. The misfire value of such weapons increases by 1 for each week after its creation, although the experimental gunsmith can return the misfire rate to normal by spending 1 day maintaining the weapon and spending 50 gp in raw materials. For the purposes of crafting such firearms, each innovation is treated as the masterwork weapon quality (with a value of 300 gp).</p>
			<p>At 5th level, and every four levels after that (9th, 13th, and 17th level), the experimental gunsmith learns one additional innovation from the list below. These represent constant and increasingly skilled tinkering with a single firearm in her possession, and when the experimental gunsmith gains an innovation, she may immediately apply it to her experimental firearm. Once an innovation has been selected, it cannot be changed. This ability replaces gun training.</p>
			<p><i>Expanded Capacity: </i>The experimental gunsmith increases her firearm&#146;s capacity by one (generally by adding another barrel, depending on the weapon&#146;s design). She also increases its weight by 50%. Because of the complexity of increasing its capacity, her weapon is more prone to misfire, and its misfire value increases by 1 (this is in addition to any misfire increase if the weapon is made with the Gunsmithing feat).</p>
			<p><i>Expanded Chamber: </i>The experimental gunsmith&#146;s firearm has a much larger than normal chamber for black powder, allowing her to use 2 doses of powder with each shot. The weapon grants a +1 circumstance bonus on damage rolls. However, when the weapon misfires, it causes a flashburn. This is the same as the weapon exploding (dealing damage from a corner of the experimental gunsmith&#146;s square), except the weapon is not automatically destroyed. If a broken weapon misfires, it is destroyed as normal.</p>
			<p><i>Grapple Launcher: </i>The experimental gunsmith&#146;s firearm includes a special set of rails that allows her to slide a grappling hook over the barrel and fire it as a full-round action. The grappling hook anchors into anything she successfully hits with an attack roll, and the DC of the Strength check required to pull the grappling hook loose is equal to her attack roll to lodge it in place. A Disable Device check can remove it with a +5 bonus on the check, and a creature struck by the hook can escape it with a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check with a +5 bonus on the check. The firearm is powerful enough to fire a hook trailing up to 100 feet of rope, but throws off the balance of the experimental gunsmith&#146;s firearm, reducing its range increment by 50%.</p>
			<p><i>Recoilless: </i>The experimental gunsmith&#146;s firearm includes a series of gears, springs, and pistons designed to reduce its recoil and thus improve accuracy. The range increment of the weapon increases by 10 feet. However, the system is fragile, and easily damaged. Anytime the weapon misfires, this system becomes broken and does not function until the experimental gunsmith spends 1 hour repairing it.</p>
			<p><i>Vial Launcher: </i>The experimental gunsmith adds a special tube onto her firearm that can hold 1 vial of alchemical material, such as alchemist&#146;s fire, a tanglefoot bag, or a thunderstone. A special trigger allows her to channel the force of black powder into this tube to launch the vial as a ranged attack with half the range increment of her firearm. The experimental gunsmith can take this action in place of any single ranged attack, and may use the same attack bonus that she can apply to the firearm. If the alchemical substance has a save DC, it becomes 10 + 1/2 her experimental gunsmith level + her Wisdom modifier when she launches the vial from her firearm. This increase only applies to the initial saving throw. If additional saving throws are called for, they are resolved as normal. Reloading the tube is a time-consuming process and requires two full-round actions. If the weapon misfires while loaded with an alchemical substance, it detonates with the experimental gunsmith (and the firearm) as the target.</p>
			<p><b>True Grit (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a gunslinger picks two deeds that she has access to and that she must spend grit to perform. She can perform these deeds for 1 grit point fewer (minimum 0) than usual. If the number of grit points to perform a deed is reduced to 0, the gunslinger can perform this deed as long as she has at least 1 grit point. If a deed could already be performed as long as she had at least 1 grit point, she can now perform that deed even when she has no grit points.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The bushwhacker specializes in the art of the ambush. For her, gunplay works best when it comes from a concealed position and is directed against a target that falls with the very first volley and is dead before the smoke clears. A bushwhacker has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For a renegade few, battle sounds different than it does for the typical fighter. The clash of steel and the sizzle of spell energy are drowned out by the thunderous rhythm of gunfire&#151;the pounding beat of the gunslinger.</p>
			<p>Gunslingers are a bold and mysterious lot. While many treat the secrets of black powder with the same care and reverence that a wizard typically reserves for his spellbook, most gunslingers know that firearms are a secret that cannot remain concealed forever. While current firearms are simple, often imprecise, and even dangerous devices, they are a technology on the move, and one that will become even more powerful when it is fully fused with magic.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Gunslingers are thunderous artillery, often found where the fighting is fiercest. Brave, clever, and frequently foolhardy, many gunslingers push to position themselves at close range, barrels blazing, to take down their foes and demoralize their enemies. Other gunslingers are masters of distant death, picking off enemies from afar with their strange and wondrous weapons.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Race: </b>Kobold Only</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Gunslinger's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Gunslingers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with all firearms. They are proficient with all light armor.</p>
			<p><b>Gunsmith: </b>At 1st level, a gunslinger gains one of the following firearms of her choice: blunderbuss, musket, or pistol. Her starting weapon is battered, and only she knows how to use it properly. All other creatures treat her gun as if it had the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it does not work at all for anyone else trying to use it. This starting weapon can only be sold for scrap (it's worth 4d10 gp when sold). The gunslinger also gains Gunsmithing as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Grit (Ex): </b>A gunslinger makes her mark upon the world with daring deeds. Some gunslingers claim they belong to a mystical way of the gun, but it's more likely that the volatile nature of firearms simply prunes the unlucky and careless from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all gunslingers have grit. In game terms, grit is a fluctuating measure of a gunslinger's ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a gunslinger gains a number of grit points equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Her grit goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), though some feats and magic items may affect this maximum. A gunslinger spends grit to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains grit in the following ways.</p>
			<p><i>Critical Hit with a Firearm: </i>Each time the gunslinger confirms a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level does not restore grit.</p>
			<p><i>Killing Blow with a Firearm: </i>When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.</p>
			<p><b>Trembling Grit (Ex): </b>At 1st level, at the start of each day, a bushwhacker gains grit points equal to her Wisdom modifier &#150; 1 (minimum of 1). In addition to all the ways any gunslinger can regain grit, a bushwhacker who reduces a helpless or unaware opponent to 0 hit points or fewer also regains 1 grit point. This expands the way in which the bushwhacker gains grit points, so a bushwhacker who gains grit points in this way only gains 1 grit point for reducing a helpless or unaware opponent, not 2 grit points. This otherwise works like the gunslinger&#146;s grit ability and alters that ability.</p>
			<p><b>Craven Deeds (Ex): </b>A bushwhacker replaces some of her deeds with the following deeds. This ability otherwise works like the gunslinger&#146;s deed ability and alters that ability.</p>
			<p><i>Shifty Shot (Ex): </i>At 3rd level, a bushwhacker with at least 1 grit point deals 1d6 points of extra damage when using her firearm to attack opponents denied their Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not). Except for the requirement that she must use a firearm and must have at least 1 grit point to use it, this deed otherwise works identically to a rogue&#146;s sneak attack class feature (including the requirement that she must be within 30 feet of her target to deal this extra damage), and stacks with the sneak shot ability (see below) and sneak attack. This deed replaces the utility shot deed.</p>
			<p><i>Long Range Shifty Shot (Ex): </i>At 7th level, a bushwhacker can double the range at which she deals extra damage from a sneak attack or shifty shot (from 30 feet to 60 feet) with a firearm by spending 1 grit point. When she spends this grit point, she must still have at least 1 grit point left to deal extra damage from shifty shot if she is using this deed. This deed replaces the targeting deed.</p>
			<p><b>Deeds: </b>Gunslingers spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.</p>
			<p><b>Nimble (Ex): </b>Starting at 2nd level, a gunslinger gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC while wearing light or no armor. Anything that causes the gunslinger to lose her Dexterity bonus to AC also causes the gunslinger to lose this dodge bonus. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd level (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level).</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Shot (Ex): </b>At 4th level and every four levels thereafter, a bushwhacker deals 1d6 points of extra damage when using a firearm to attack opponents who are unable to properly defend themselves. Unlike with the shifty shot ability, she deals this extra damage regardless of whether or not she has any grit points when making the attack. Except for the requirement that she makes a firearm attack, this works identically to a rogue&#146;s sneak attack class feature. This extra damage stacks with sneak attack and the damage from shifty shot. This ability replaces the bonus feats the gunslinger gains at 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th level.</p>
			<p><b>Gun Training (Ex): </b>Starting at 5th level, a gunslinger can select one specific type of firearm (such as an axe musket, blunderbuss, musket, or pistol). She gains a bonus equal to her Dexterity modifier on damage rolls when firing that type of firearm. Furthermore, when she misfires with that type of firearm, the misfire value of that firearm increases by 2 instead of 4.</p>
			<p>Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), the gunslinger picks up another type of firearm, gaining these bonuses for those types as well.</p>
			<p><b>True Grit (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a gunslinger picks two deeds that she has access to and that she must spend grit to perform. She can perform these deeds for 1 grit point fewer (minimum 0) than usual. If the number of grit points to perform a deed is reduced to 0, the gunslinger can perform this deed as long as she has at least 1 grit point. If a deed could already be performed as long as she had at least 1 grit point, she can now perform that deed even when she has no grit points.</p>

					<p>Pirate&#146;s Jargon (Ex): At 3rd level, the buccaneer&#146;s baffling palaver of nautical jargon and piratical cant provides a +2 bonus on Bluff and Intimidate checks. Furthermore, she can spend a swift action and 1 grit point to cause a single living creature within 30 feet to make a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 her buccaneer level + her Charisma modifier) or become confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting language-dependent effect. This replaces the pistol whip deed.</p>
					<p>Rope Swing (Ex): At 7th level, as long as the buccaneer has at least 1 grit point, she gains a bonus on Acrobatics and Climb checks equal to her gunslinger level when climbing or swinging on a rope. If she spends 1 grit point, her move while climbing or swinging on a rope does not provoke attacks of opportunity. This replaces the dead shot deed.</p>
					<p>Captain&#146;s Curse (Sp): At 11th level, a buccaneer can spend 2 grit points to use old salt&#146;s curse as a spell-like ability. At 15th level, she may use black mark instead. The caster level for these spell-like abilities is equal to the buccaneer&#146;s class level, and the save DC is equal to 10 + her buccaneer level + her Charisma modifier.

					<p>Pirate&#146;s Jargon (Ex): At 3rd level, the buccaneer&#146;s baffling palaver of nautical jargon and piratical cant provides a +2 bonus on Bluff and Intimidate checks. Furthermore, she can spend a swift action and 1 grit point to cause a single living creature within 30 feet to make a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 her buccaneer level + her Charisma modifier) or become confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting language-dependent effect. This replaces the pistol whip deed.</p>
					<p>Rope Swing (Ex): At 7th level, as long as the buccaneer has at least 1 grit point, she gains a bonus on Acrobatics and Climb checks equal to her gunslinger level when climbing or swinging on a rope. If she spends 1 grit point, her move while climbing or swinging on a rope does not provoke attacks of opportunity. This replaces the dead shot deed.</p>
					<p>Captain&#146;s Curse (Sp): At 11th level, a buccaneer can spend 2 grit points to use old salt&#146;s curse as a spell-like ability. At 15th level, she may use black mark instead. The caster level for these spell-like abilities is equal to the buccaneer&#146;s class level, and the save DC is equal to 10 + her buccaneer level + her Charisma modifier. This replaces the lightning reload deed.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Freebooters who cling to the convoluted codes that rule independent ships, the buccaneer is a gunslinger of the high seas. Their exploits are fueled by the thrill of danger and often by the temporary courage provided by grog. A buccaneer has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For a renegade few, battle sounds different than it does for the typical fighter. The clash of steel and the sizzle of spell energy are drowned out by the thunderous rhythm of gunfire&#151;the pounding beat of the gunslinger.</p>
			<p>Gunslingers are a bold and mysterious lot. While many treat the secrets of black powder with the same care and reverence that a wizard typically reserves for his spellbook, most gunslingers know that firearms are a secret that cannot remain concealed forever. While current firearms are simple, often imprecise, and even dangerous devices, they are a technology on the move, and one that will become even more powerful when it is fully fused with magic.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Gunslingers are thunderous artillery, often found where the fighting is fiercest. Brave, clever, and frequently foolhardy, many gunslingers push to position themselves at close range, barrels blazing, to take down their foes and demoralize their enemies. Other gunslingers are masters of distant death, picking off enemies from afar with their strange and wondrous weapons.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Gunslinger's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Gunslingers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with all firearms. They are proficient with all light armor.</p>
			<p><b>Gunsmith: </b>At 1st level, a gunslinger gains one of the following firearms of her choice: blunderbuss, musket, or pistol. Her starting weapon is battered, and only she knows how to use it properly. All other creatures treat her gun as if it had the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it does not work at all for anyone else trying to use it. This starting weapon can only be sold for scrap (it's worth 4d10 gp when sold). The gunslinger also gains Gunsmithing as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Grit (Ex): </b>Like the sea itself, a buccaneer is a force of nature. Instead of using her Wisdom modifier to determine the number of grit points she gains at the start of each day, she uses her Charisma modifier. This ability works in all other ways like the gunslinger&#146;s grit class feature.</p>
			<p>A gunslinger makes her mark upon the world with daring deeds. Some gunslingers claim they belong to a mystical way of the gun, but it's more likely that the volatile nature of firearms simply prunes the unlucky and careless from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all gunslingers have grit. In game terms, grit is a fluctuating measure of a gunslinger's ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a gunslinger gains a number of grit points equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Her grit goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), though some feats and magic items may affect this maximum. A gunslinger spends grit to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains grit in the following ways.</p>
			<p><i>Critical Hit with a Firearm: </i>Each time the gunslinger confirms a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level does not restore grit.</p>
			<p><i>Killing Blow with a Firearm: </i>When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.</p>
			<p><b>Deeds: </b>Gunslingers spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.</p>
			<p>A buccaneer swaps four of the normal gunslinger deeds for the following deeds.</p>
			<p><i>Seadog&#146;s Gait (Ex): </i>At 1st level, the buccaneer gains Sea Legs as a bonus feat. If she spends 1 grit point, she can ignore difficult terrain until the end of her turn. This replaces the quick clear deed.</p>
			<p><i>Pirate&#146;s Jargon (Ex): </i>At 3rd level, the buccaneer&#146;s baffling palaver of nautical jargon and piratical cant provides a +2 bonus on Bluff and Intimidate checks. Furthermore, she can spend a swift action and 1 grit point to cause a single living creature within 30 feet to make a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 her buccaneer level + her Charisma modifier) or become confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting language-dependent effect. This replaces the pistol whip deed.</p>
			<p><i>Rope Swing (Ex): </i>At 7th level, as long as the buccaneer has at least 1 grit point, she gains a bonus on Acrobatics and Climb checks equal to her gunslinger level when climbing or swinging on a rope. If she spends 1 grit point, her move while climbing or swinging on a rope does not provoke attacks of opportunity. This replaces the dead shot deed.</p>
			<p><i>Captain&#146;s Curse (Sp): </i>At 11th level, a buccaneer can spend 2 grit points to use old salt&#146;s curse as a spell-like ability. At 15th level, she may use black mark instead. The caster level for these spell-like abilities is equal to the buccaneer&#146;s class level, and the save DC is equal to 10 + her buccaneer level + her Charisma modifier. This replaces the lightning reload deed.</p>
			<p><b>Nimble (Ex): </b>Starting at 2nd level, a gunslinger gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC while wearing light or no armor. Anything that causes the gunslinger to lose her Dexterity bonus to AC also causes the gunslinger to lose this dodge bonus. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd level (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level).</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feats: </b>At 4th level, and every four levels thereafter, a gunslinger gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained by normal advancement. These bonus feats must be combat or grit feats.</p>
			<p>In addition to combat and grit feats, a buccaneer can select from the following feats as her bonus feats: Expert Driver (water vehicles only), Master Siege Engineer, Siege Engineer, Siege Gunner, Skilled Driver (water vehicles only).</p>
			<p><b>Exotic Pet (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a buccaneer gains a familiar as a wizard of half the buccaneer&#146;s class level (though the exotic pet never gains the ability to deliver touch spells or share spells). This pet is typically a monkey or parrot (use the stats for a raven familiar). Such animals are useful scouts, even in the thick of combat. As long as the pet is within 30 feet of the buccaneer, the buccaneer also gains the benefit of evasion. This ability replaces gun training 1.</p>
			<p><b>Sword and Pistol: </b>At 9th level, a buccaneer gains Sword and Pistol as a bonus feat even if she does not meet the prerequisites. This ability replaces gun training 2.</p>
			<p><b>Gun Training (Ex): </b>Starting at 13th level, a gunslinger can select one specific type of firearm (such as an axe musket, blunderbuss, musket, or pistol). She gains a bonus equal to her Dexterity modifier on damage rolls when firing that type of firearm. Furthermore, when she misfires with that type of firearm, the misfire value of that firearm increases by 2 instead of 4.</p>
			<p><b>Raider&#146;s Riposte (Ex): </b>At 17th level, whenever an enemy misses a buccaneer with an attack of opportunity, it provokes an attack of opportunity from the buccaneer. This ability replaces gun training 4.</p>
			<p><b>True Grit (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a gunslinger picks two deeds that she has access to and that she must spend grit to perform. She can perform these deeds for 1 grit point fewer (minimum 0) than usual. If the number of grit points to perform a deed is reduced to 0, the gunslinger can perform this deed as long as she has at least 1 grit point. If a deed could already be performed as long as she had at least 1 grit point, she can now perform that deed even when she has no grit points.</p>

					<p>A bolt ace regains grit when she scores a critical hit or deals a killing blow with any kind of crossbow. This ability modifies the grit class feature.</p>
					<p>A gunslinger makes her mark upon the world with daring deeds. Some gunslingers claim they belong to a mystical way of the gun, but it's more likely that the volatile nature of firearms simply prunes the unlucky and careless from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all gunslingers have grit. In game terms, grit is a fluctuating measure of a gunslinger's ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a gunslinger gains a number of grit points equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Her grit goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), though some feats and magic items may affect this maximum. A gunslinger spends grit to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains grit in the following ways.</p>
					<p><i>Critical Hit with a Firearm: </i>Each time the gunslinger confirms a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level does not restore grit.</p>
					<p><i>Killing Blow with a Firearm: </i>When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.</p>

					<p>Sharp Shoot (Ex): At 1st level, a bolt ace can resolve an attack against touch AC instead of normal AC when firing a crossbow at a target within its first range increment. Performing this deed costs 1 grit point. This deed's cost cannot be reduced by any ability or effect that reduces the amount of grit points a deed costs (such as Signature Deed). This deed replaces deadeye.</p>
					<p>Vigilant Loading (Ex): At 1st level, as long as a bolt ace has at least 1 grit point, she does not provoke attacks of opportunity when loading a crossbow. This deed replaces quick clear.</p>
					<p>Shooter&#146;s Resolve (Ex): At 3rd level, a bolt ace can spend 1 grit point when making a crossbow attack as a standard action and ignore the effects of concealment (though not total concealment) and cover (other than total cover) against that shot. This deed replaces utility shot.</p>
					<p>Distracting Shot (Ex): At 7th level, a bolt ace can spend 1 grit point and choose to miss a target that she could normally attack within her range with a crossbow attack. When she does, the target loses its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) for 1 round. This deed replaces startling shot.</p>
					<p>Vigilant Shooter (Ex): At 11th level, as long as a bolt ace spends 1 grit point when she does so, she does not provoke attacks of opportunity when firing a crossbow. This deed replaces expert loading.</p>
					<p>Inexplicable Reload (Ex): At 11th level, loading a crossbow becomes unthinking and automatic for a bolt ace. As long as she has at least 1 grit point, she always starts each round of combat (even a surprise round) with her crossbow loaded. Also the amount of time needed to reload a crossbow decreases by one step: a standard action becomes a move action, a move action becomes a swift action, a swift action becomes a free action, and a free action becomes not an action. This deed replaces lightning reload.</p>
					<p>Pinning Shot (Ex): At 15th level, the bolt ace can spend 1 grit point while shooting a crossbow and attempt to pin down its target with the bolt. If the crossbow attack hits, it pins the target to a nearby object, to a wall, or to the ground, entangling and staggering the target. While pinned by the bolt, the target cannot move out of its space until it takes a standard action to free itself from the pinning bolt, except by means of teleportation.

If the number of grit points to perform a deed is reduced to 0, the gunslinger can perform this deed as long as she has at least 1 grit point. If a deed could already be performed as long as she had at least 1 grit point, she can now perform that deed even when she has no grit points.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>While gunslingers are full of sound and fury, there is a class of gunslingers that never soil their hands with powder or feel the sting of gun smoke. They commit their deeds in a more hushed manner, but with just as much flair.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For a renegade few, battle sounds different than it does for the typical fighter. The clash of steel and the sizzle of spell energy are drowned out by the thunderous rhythm of gunfire&#151;the pounding beat of the gunslinger.</p>
			<p>Gunslingers are a bold and mysterious lot. While many treat the secrets of black powder with the same care and reverence that a wizard typically reserves for his spellbook, most gunslingers know that firearms are a secret that cannot remain concealed forever. While current firearms are simple, often imprecise, and even dangerous devices, they are a technology on the move, and one that will become even more powerful when it is fully fused with magic.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Gunslingers are thunderous artillery, often found where the fighting is fiercest. Brave, clever, and frequently foolhardy, many gunslingers push to position themselves at close range, barrels blazing, to take down their foes and demoralize their enemies. Other gunslingers are masters of distant death, picking off enemies from afar with their strange and wondrous weapons.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Gunslinger's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Gunslingers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with all firearms. They are proficient with all light armor.</p>
			<p><b>Gunsmith: </b>At 1st level, a gunslinger gains one of the following firearms of her choice: blunderbuss, musket, or pistol. Her starting weapon is battered, and only she knows how to use it properly. All other creatures treat her gun as if it had the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it does not work at all for anyone else trying to use it. This starting weapon can only be sold for scrap (it's worth 4d10 gp when sold). The gunslinger also gains Gunsmithing as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Grit (Ex): </b>A bolt ace regains grit when she scores a critical hit or deals a killing blow with any kind of crossbow. This ability modifies the grit class feature.</p>
			<p>A gunslinger makes her mark upon the world with daring deeds. Some gunslingers claim they belong to a mystical way of the gun, but it's more likely that the volatile nature of firearms simply prunes the unlucky and careless from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all gunslingers have grit. In game terms, grit is a fluctuating measure of a gunslinger's ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a gunslinger gains a number of grit points equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Her grit goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), though some feats and magic items may affect this maximum. A gunslinger spends grit to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains grit in the following ways.</p>
			<p><i>Critical Hit with a Firearm: </i>Each time the gunslinger confirms a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level does not restore grit.</p>
			<p><i>Killing Blow with a Firearm: </i>When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.</p>
			<p><b>Deeds: </b>Gunslingers spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.</p>
			<p>A bolt ace can perform the following deeds with a crossbow instead of a firearm: gunslinger initiative, pistol-whip, dead shot, targeting, bleeding wound, death&#146;s shot, and stunning shot. The bolt ace swaps the following deeds.</p>
			<p><i>Sharp Shoot (Ex): </i>At 1st level, a bolt ace can resolve an attack against touch AC instead of normal AC when firing a crossbow at a target within its first range increment. Performing this deed costs 1 grit point. This deed's cost cannot be reduced by any ability or effect that reduces the amount of grit points a deed costs (such as Signature Deed). This deed replaces deadeye.</p>
			<p><i>Vigilant Loading (Ex): </i>At 1st level, as long as a bolt ace has at least 1 grit point, she does not provoke attacks of opportunity when loading a crossbow. This deed replaces quick clear.</p>
			<p><i>Shooter&#146;s Resolve (Ex): </i>At 3rd level, a bolt ace can spend 1 grit point when making a crossbow attack as a standard action and ignore the effects of concealment (though not total concealment) and cover (other than total cover) against that shot. This deed replaces utility shot.</p>
			<p><i>Distracting Shot (Ex): </i>At 7th level, a bolt ace can spend 1 grit point and choose to miss a target that she could normally attack within her range with a crossbow attack. When she does, the target loses its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) for 1 round. This deed replaces startling shot.</p>
			<p><i>Vigilant Shooter (Ex): </i>At 11th level, as long as a bolt ace spends 1 grit point when she does so, she does not provoke attacks of opportunity when firing a crossbow. This deed replaces expert loading.</p>
			<p><i>Inexplicable Reload (Ex): </i>At 11th level, loading a crossbow becomes unthinking and automatic for a bolt ace. As long as she has at least 1 grit point, she always starts each round of combat (even a surprise round) with her crossbow loaded. Also the amount of time needed to reload a crossbow decreases by one step: a standard action becomes a move action, a move action becomes a swift action, a swift action becomes a free action, and a free action becomes not an action. This deed replaces lightning reload.</p>
			<p><i>Pinning Shot (Ex): </i>At 15th level, the bolt ace can spend 1 grit point while shooting a crossbow and attempt to pin down its target with the bolt. If the crossbow attack hits, it pins the target to a nearby object, to a wall, or to the ground, entangling and staggering the target. While pinned by the bolt, the target cannot move out of its space until it takes a standard action to free itself from the pinning bolt, except by means of teleportation. This deed replaces menacing shot.</p>
			<p><b>Nimble (Ex): </b>Starting at 2nd level, a gunslinger gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC while wearing light or no armor. Anything that causes the gunslinger to lose her Dexterity bonus to AC also causes the gunslinger to lose this dodge bonus. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd level (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level).</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feats: </b>At 4th level, and every four levels thereafter, a gunslinger gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained by normal advancement. These bonus feats must be combat or grit feats.</p>
			<p><b>Crossbow Training (Ex): </b>Starting at 5th level, a bolt ace can select one specific type of crossbow, such as hand crossbow or heavy crossbow. She gains a bonus on damage rolls equal to her Dexterity modifier with that crossbow. Furthermore, when she scores a critical hit with that type of crossbow, her critical modifier increases by 1 (a 2 becomes a 3, for example).</p>
			<p>Every 4 levels thereafter, she can pick a different type of crossbow, gaining the bonus damage and increased critical multiplier with that type of crossbow as well. This ability replaces gun training.</p>
			<p><b>True Grit (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a gunslinger picks two deeds that she has access to and that she must spend grit to perform. She can perform these deeds for 1 grit point fewer (minimum 0) than usual. If the number of grit points to perform a deed is reduced to 0, the gunslinger can perform this deed as long as she has at least 1 grit point. If a deed could already be performed as long as she had at least 1 grit point, she can now perform that deed even when she has no grit points.</p>

					<p>A blatherskite swaps four deeds for the following.</p>
					<p>Blatherskite&#146;s Stagger (Ex): At 1st level as an immediate action, when a ranged attack would normally miss a blatherskite, he can allow it to hit him and dramatically stagger a few steps backward, moving up to 10 feet directly away from the attacker. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. The attack deals the minimum amount of damage (as though the attacker had rolled a natural 1 on each damage die).</p>
					<p>At 2nd level, if a ranged attack hits the blatherskite but the attack roll exceeds his AC by no more than his bonus from the nimble class feature, he can spend 1 grit point as an immediate action to take the minimum amount of damage and move up to 10 feet directly away from the attacker. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.</p>
					<p>The gunslinger can perform this deed only while wearing medium or light armor and while carrying no more than a light load. This deed replaces the gunslinger&#146;s dodge deed.</p>
					<p>Blatherskite&#146;s Initiative (Ex): At 3rd level, the blatherskite gains benefits as long as he has at least 1 grit point. The blatherskite gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks. Furthermore, if he is trained in Stealth (and as long as he is not paralyzed, prone, or otherwise immobilized), he can take a 5-foot step and attempt a Stealth check to hide as part of the initiative check, provided there is an object or a larger creature to hide behind; if he spends 1 grit point, he can move up to half his speed instead of taking only a 5-foot step as part of the initiative check. This deed replaces the gunslinger initiative deed.</p>
					<p>Cheap Shot (Ex): At 3rd level, if the blatherskite has at least 1 grit point and makes a successful attack against an unarmed target with a firearm that is not making a scattering shot, he deals 1d6 additional points of damage. This is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. This deed replaces the pistol-whip deed.</p>
					<p>Blatherskite&#146;s Surprise (Ex): At 7th level, when the blatherskite succeeds at a saving throw against a spell or an effect that would cause him to be blinded, confused, dazed, fascinated, frightened, nauseated, paralyzed, or stunned, he can allow the effect to affect him normally. As long as he has at least 1 grit point, as an immediate action he can cause the creature from which the effect originated to lose its Dexterity bonus to AC for a number of rounds equal to half the duration of the effect (in rounds) or half the gunslinger&#146;s level, whichever is lower (minimum 1 round). If he instead spends 1 grit point, he does not need to allow the effect to affect him normally to use this deed.</p>

					<p>Blatherskite&#146;s Surprise (Ex): At 7th level, when the blatherskite succeeds at a saving throw against a spell or an effect that would cause him to be blinded, confused, dazed, fascinated, frightened, nauseated, paralyzed, or stunned, he can allow the effect to affect him normally. As long as he has at least 1 grit point, as an immediate action he can cause the creature from which the effect originated to lose its Dexterity bonus to AC for a number of rounds equal to half the duration of the effect (in rounds) or half the gunslinger&#146;s level, whichever is lower (minimum 1 round). If he instead spends 1 grit point, he does not need to allow the effect to affect him normally to use this deed.</p>

					<p>Gunslingers spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower.

					<p>Blatherskite&#146;s Stagger (Ex): At 1st level as an immediate action, when a ranged attack would normally miss a blatherskite, he can allow it to hit him and dramatically stagger a few steps backward, moving up to 10 feet directly away from the attacker. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. The attack deals the minimum amount of damage (as though the attacker had rolled a natural 1 on each damage die).</p>
					<p>At 2nd level, if a ranged attack hits the blatherskite but the attack roll exceeds his AC by no more than his bonus from the nimble class feature, he can spend 1 grit point as an immediate action to take the minimum amount of damage and move up to 10 feet directly away from the attacker. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.</p>
					<p>The gunslinger can perform this deed only while wearing medium or light armor and while carrying no more than a light load. This deed replaces the gunslinger&#146;s dodge deed.</p>
					<p>Blatherskite&#146;s Initiative (Ex): At 3rd level, the blatherskite gains benefits as long as he has at least 1 grit point. The blatherskite gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks. Furthermore, if he is trained in Stealth (and as long as he is not paralyzed, prone, or otherwise immobilized), he can take a 5-foot step and attempt a Stealth check to hide as part of the initiative check, provided there is an object or a larger creature to hide behind; if he spends 1 grit point, he can move up to half his speed instead of taking only a 5-foot step as part of the initiative check.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A blatherskite talks big and feels powerful when holding a loaded gun, but when the gun jams or the situation gets too intense, he&#146;s the first to run for cover. He has an extraordinary talent for retreating from harm&#146;s way and fooling his enemies into thinking he is weaker than he is.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For a renegade few, battle sounds different than it does for the typical fighter. The clash of steel and the sizzle of spell energy are drowned out by the thunderous rhythm of gunfire&#151;the pounding beat of the gunslinger.</p>
			<p>Gunslingers are a bold and mysterious lot. While many treat the secrets of black powder with the same care and reverence that a wizard typically reserves for his spellbook, most gunslingers know that firearms are a secret that cannot remain concealed forever. While current firearms are simple, often imprecise, and even dangerous devices, they are a technology on the move, and one that will become even more powerful when it is fully fused with magic.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Gunslingers are thunderous artillery, often found where the fighting is fiercest. Brave, clever, and frequently foolhardy, many gunslingers push to position themselves at close range, barrels blazing, to take down their foes and demoralize their enemies. Other gunslingers are masters of distant death, picking off enemies from afar with their strange and wondrous weapons.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Gunslinger's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Gunslingers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with all firearms. They are proficient with all light armor.</p>
			<p><b>Gunsmith: </b>At 1st level, a gunslinger gains one of the following firearms of her choice: blunderbuss, musket, or pistol. Her starting weapon is battered, and only she knows how to use it properly. All other creatures treat her gun as if it had the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it does not work at all for anyone else trying to use it. This starting weapon can only be sold for scrap (it's worth 4d10 gp when sold). The gunslinger also gains Gunsmithing as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Grit (Ex): </b>A gunslinger makes her mark upon the world with daring deeds. Some gunslingers claim they belong to a mystical way of the gun, but it's more likely that the volatile nature of firearms simply prunes the unlucky and careless from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all gunslingers have grit. In game terms, grit is a fluctuating measure of a gunslinger's ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a gunslinger gains a number of grit points equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Her grit goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), though some feats and magic items may affect this maximum. A gunslinger spends grit to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains grit in the following ways.</p>
			<p><i>Critical Hit with a Firearm: </i>Each time the gunslinger confirms a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level does not restore grit.</p>
			<p><i>Killing Blow with a Firearm: </i>When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.</p>
			<p><b>Deeds: </b>Gunslingers spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.</p>
			<p>A blatherskite swaps four deeds for the following.</p>
			<p><i>Blatherskite&#146;s Stagger (Ex): </i>At 1st level as an immediate action, when a ranged attack would normally miss a blatherskite, he can allow it to hit him and dramatically stagger a few steps backward, moving up to 10 feet directly away from the attacker. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. The attack deals the minimum amount of damage (as though the attacker had rolled a natural 1 on each damage die).</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, if a ranged attack hits the blatherskite but the attack roll exceeds his AC by no more than his bonus from the nimble class feature, he can spend 1 grit point as an immediate action to take the minimum amount of damage and move up to 10 feet directly away from the attacker. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.</p>
			<p>The gunslinger can perform this deed only while wearing medium or light armor and while carrying no more than a light load. This deed replaces the gunslinger&#146;s dodge deed.</p>
			<p><i>Blatherskite&#146;s Initiative (Ex): </i>At 3rd level, the blatherskite gains benefits as long as he has at least 1 grit point. The blatherskite gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks. Furthermore, if he is trained in Stealth (and as long as he is not paralyzed, prone, or otherwise immobilized), he can take a 5-foot step and attempt a Stealth check to hide as part of the initiative check, provided there is an object or a larger creature to hide behind; if he spends 1 grit point, he can move up to half his speed instead of taking only a 5-foot step as part of the initiative check. This deed replaces the gunslinger initiative deed.</p>
			<p><i>Cheap Shot (Ex): </i>At 3rd level, if the blatherskite has at least 1 grit point and makes a successful attack against an unarmed target with a firearm that is not making a scattering shot, he deals 1d6 additional points of damage. This is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. This deed replaces the pistol-whip deed.</p>
			<p><i>Blatherskite&#146;s Surprise (Ex): </i>At 7th level, when the blatherskite succeeds at a saving throw against a spell or an effect that would cause him to be blinded, confused, dazed, fascinated, frightened, nauseated, paralyzed, or stunned, he can allow the effect to affect him normally. As long as he has at least 1 grit point, as an immediate action he can cause the creature from which the effect originated to lose its Dexterity bonus to AC for a number of rounds equal to half the duration of the effect (in rounds) or half the gunslinger&#146;s level, whichever is lower (minimum 1 round). If he instead spends 1 grit point, he does not need to allow the effect to affect him normally to use this deed. This deed replaces the startling shot deed.</p>
			<p><b>Nimble (Ex): </b>Starting at 2nd level, a gunslinger gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC while wearing light or no armor. Anything that causes the gunslinger to lose her Dexterity bonus to AC also causes the gunslinger to lose this dodge bonus. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd level (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level).</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feats: </b>At 4th level, and every four levels thereafter, a gunslinger gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained by normal advancement. These bonus feats must be combat or grit feats.</p>
			<p><b>Gun Training (Ex): </b>Starting at 5th level, a gunslinger can select one specific type of firearm (such as an axe musket, blunderbuss, musket, or pistol). She gains a bonus equal to her Dexterity modifier on damage rolls when firing that type of firearm. Furthermore, when she misfires with that type of firearm, the misfire value of that firearm increases by 2 instead of 4.</p>
			<p>Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), the gunslinger picks up another type of firearm, gaining these bonuses for those types as well.</p>
			<p><b>True Grit (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a gunslinger picks two deeds that she has access to and that she must spend grit to perform. She can perform these deeds for 1 grit point fewer (minimum 0) than usual. If the number of grit points to perform a deed is reduced to 0, the gunslinger can perform this deed as long as she has at least 1 grit point. If a deed could already be performed as long as she had at least 1 grit point, she can now perform that deed even when she has no grit points.</p>

					<p>At 1st level, a gunslinger gains one of the following firearms of her choice: blunderbuss, musket, or pistol. Her starting weapon is battered, and only she knows how to use it properly. All other creatures treat her gun as if it had the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it does not work at all for anyone else trying to use it. This starting weapon can only be sold for scrap (it's worth 4d10 gp when sold). The gunslinger also gains Gunsmithing as a bonus feat.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A gunslinger makes her mark upon the world with daring deeds. Some gunslingers claim they belong to a mystical way of the gun, but it's more likely that the volatile nature of firearms simply prunes the unlucky and careless from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all gunslingers have grit. In game terms, grit is a fluctuating measure of a gunslinger's ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a gunslinger gains a number of grit points equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Her grit goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), though some feats and magic items may affect this maximum. A gunslinger spends grit to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains grit in the following ways.</p>
					<p><i>Critical Hit with a Firearm: </i>Each time the gunslinger confirms a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level does not restore grit.</p>
					<p><i>Killing Blow with a Firearm: </i>When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.</p>

					<p>Gunslingers spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.</p>
					<p>A black powder vaulter gains the following deeds.</p>
					<p>Mobile Reload (Ex): If a black powder vaulter has at least 1 grit point, she can reload a firearm as part of a move action to move, provided that the action to reload that firearm with that type of ammunition would normally take only a move action or swift action. At 3rd level, she can use this deed while also using the shot on the run deed. This deed replaces the deadeye deed.</p>
					<p>Daring Vault (Ex): A black powder vaulter can spend 1 grit point as a swift action to increase her land speed by 20 feet (gaining the appropriate bonus on Acrobatics checks to jump) until the end of her turn. If the black powder vaulter jumps while affected by this deed, she can make a second jump while midair if she is adjacent to a wall, column, or other solid, permanent structure. The second jump counts as having a running start even if the direction is different from the first jump. This deed replaces the gunslinger&#146;s dodge deed.</p>
					<p>Shot on the Run (Ex): At 3rd level, if the black powder vaulter has at least 1 grit point, she gains the benefits of the Shot on the Run feat. She gains this benefit only when making an attack with a firearm with which she is proficient. At 7th level, she can use the targeting deed as part of the same full-round action as using Shot on the Run. This deed replaces the gunslinger initiative deed.</p>
					<p>Art of the Gun (Ex): At 7th level, if the black powder vaulter has at least 1 grit point, she doesn&#146;t provoke attacks of opportunity when attacking with a firearm or reloading a firearm. Additionally, whenever she is wielding a firearm, she counts as threatening an area around her as though she were wielding a melee weapon. If an opponent provokes an attack of opportunity from her, she can use the pistol-whip deed as her attack of opportunity, spending 1 grit point as normal. Alternatively, if her firearm is loaded, she can spend 1 grit point to fire her gun as her attack of opportunity. This deed replaces the startling shot deed.</p>
					<p>Dual Shot on the Run (Ex): At 11th level, the black powder vaulter can make two attacks with firearms while using the shot on the run deed. This deed replaces the expert loading deed.</p>

			<p><i>While firearms were designed to allow combatants to fight their foes from a distance, some gunslingers like to get into the thick of the battle, maneuvering among the fray to find the most advantageous positions from which to kill their enemies. The daredevil fighting style of the black powder vaulter has arisen simultaneously in two places&#151;among Mana Wastes gunslingers inspired by the graceful fighting styles of Mwangi tribes, and among pirates from Tian Xia and the Shackles who encountered and inspired one another.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>For a renegade few, battle sounds different than it does for the typical fighter. The clash of steel and the sizzle of spell energy are drowned out by the thunderous rhythm of gunfire&#151;the pounding beat of the gunslinger.</p>
			<p>Gunslingers are a bold and mysterious lot. While many treat the secrets of black powder with the same care and reverence that a wizard typically reserves for his spellbook, most gunslingers know that firearms are a secret that cannot remain concealed forever. While current firearms are simple, often imprecise, and even dangerous devices, they are a technology on the move, and one that will become even more powerful when it is fully fused with magic.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Gunslingers are thunderous artillery, often found where the fighting is fiercest. Brave, clever, and frequently foolhardy, many gunslingers push to position themselves at close range, barrels blazing, to take down their foes and demoralize their enemies. Other gunslingers are masters of distant death, picking off enemies from afar with their strange and wondrous weapons.</p>

			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Gunslingers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with all firearms. They are proficient with all light armor.</p>
			<p><b>Gunsmith: </b>At 1st level, a gunslinger gains one of the following firearms of her choice: blunderbuss, musket, or pistol. Her starting weapon is battered, and only she knows how to use it properly. All other creatures treat her gun as if it had the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it does not work at all for anyone else trying to use it. This starting weapon can only be sold for scrap (it's worth 4d10 gp when sold). The gunslinger also gains Gunsmithing as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p><b>Grit (Ex): </b>A gunslinger makes her mark upon the world with daring deeds. Some gunslingers claim they belong to a mystical way of the gun, but it's more likely that the volatile nature of firearms simply prunes the unlucky and careless from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all gunslingers have grit. In game terms, grit is a fluctuating measure of a gunslinger's ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a gunslinger gains a number of grit points equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Her grit goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), though some feats and magic items may affect this maximum. A gunslinger spends grit to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains grit in the following ways.</p>
			<p><i>Critical Hit with a Firearm: </i>Each time the gunslinger confirms a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level does not restore grit.</p>
			<p><i>Killing Blow with a Firearm: </i>When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.</p>
			<p><b>Deeds: </b>Gunslingers spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.</p>
			<p>A black powder vaulter gains the following deeds.</p>
			<p>Mobile Reload (Ex): If a black powder vaulter has at least 1 grit point, she can reload a firearm as part of a move action to move, provided that the action to reload that firearm with that type of ammunition would normally take only a move action or swift action. At 3rd level, she can use this deed while also using the shot on the run deed. This deed replaces the deadeye deed.</p>
			<p>Daring Vault (Ex): A black powder vaulter can spend 1 grit point as a swift action to increase her land speed by 20 feet (gaining the appropriate bonus on Acrobatics checks to jump) until the end of her turn. If the black powder vaulter jumps while affected by this deed, she can make a second jump while midair if she is adjacent to a wall, column, or other solid, permanent structure. The second jump counts as having a running start even if the direction is different from the first jump. This deed replaces the gunslinger&#146;s dodge deed.</p>
			<p>Shot on the Run (Ex): At 3rd level, if the black powder vaulter has at least 1 grit point, she gains the benefits of the Shot on the Run feat. She gains this benefit only when making an attack with a firearm with which she is proficient. At 7th level, she can use the targeting deed as part of the same full-round action as using Shot on the Run. This deed replaces the gunslinger initiative deed.</p>
			<p>Art of the Gun (Ex): At 7th level, if the black powder vaulter has at least 1 grit point, she doesn&#146;t provoke attacks of opportunity when attacking with a firearm or reloading a firearm. Additionally, whenever she is wielding a firearm, she counts as threatening an area around her as though she were wielding a melee weapon. If an opponent provokes an attack of opportunity from her, she can use the pistol-whip deed as her attack of opportunity, spending 1 grit point as normal. Alternatively, if her firearm is loaded, she can spend 1 grit point to fire her gun as her attack of opportunity. This deed replaces the startling shot deed.</p>
			<p>Dual Shot on the Run (Ex): At 11th level, the black powder vaulter can make two attacks with firearms while using the shot on the run deed. This deed replaces the expert loading deed.</p>
			<p><b>Nimble (Ex): </b>Starting at 2nd level, a gunslinger gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC while wearing light or no armor. Anything that causes the gunslinger to lose her Dexterity bonus to AC also causes the gunslinger to lose this dodge bonus. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd level (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level).</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feats: </b>At 4th level, and every four levels thereafter, a gunslinger gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained by normal advancement. These bonus feats must be combat or grit feats.</p>
			<p><b>Gun Training (Ex): </b>Starting at 5th level, a gunslinger can select one specific type of firearm (such as an axe musket, blunderbuss, musket, or pistol). She gains a bonus equal to her Dexterity modifier on damage rolls when firing that type of firearm. Furthermore, when she misfires with that type of firearm, the misfire value of that firearm increases by 2 instead of 4.</p>
			<p>Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), the gunslinger picks up another type of firearm, gaining these bonuses for those types as well.</p>
			<p><b>True Grit (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a gunslinger picks two deeds that she has access to and that she must spend grit to perform. She can perform these deeds for 1 grit point fewer (minimum 0) than usual. If the number of grit points to perform a deed is reduced to 0, the gunslinger can perform this deed as long as she has at least 1 grit point. If a deed could already be performed as long as she had at least 1 grit point, she can now perform that deed even when she has no grit points.</p>
