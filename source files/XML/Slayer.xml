			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A slayer is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, as well as with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Studied Target (Ex): </b>A slayer can study an opponent he can see as a move action. The slayer then gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks attempted against that opponent, and a +1 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against it. The DCs of slayer class abilities against that opponent increase by 1. A slayer can only maintain these bonuses against one opponent at a time; these bonuses remain in effect until either the opponent is dead or the slayer studies a new target.</p>
			<p>If a slayer deals sneak attack damage to a target, he can study that target as an immediate action, allowing him to apply his studied target bonuses against that target (including to the normal weapon damage roll).</p>
			<p>At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the bonuses on weapon attack, damage rolls, and skill checks and to slayer DCs against a studied target increase by 1. In addition, at each such interval, the slayer is able to maintain these bonuses against an additional studied target at the same time. The slayer may discard this connection to a studied target as a free action, allowing him to study another target in its place.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a slayer can study an opponent as a move or swift action.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A slayer adds 1/2 his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer Talents: </b>As a slayer gains experience, he learns a number of talents that aid him and confound his foes. Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer gains one slayer talent. Unless otherwise noted, a slayer cannot select an individual talent more than once. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a slayer&#146;s sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision of which to use must be made before the attack roll is made.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>At 3rd level, if a slayer catches an opponent unable to defend itself effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot for extra damage. The slayer&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime his target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the slayer flanks his target. This additional damage is 1d6 at 3rd level, and increases by 1d6 every 3 levels thereafter. Should the slayer score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this additional damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or unarmed strike), a slayer can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. He cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The slayer must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A slayer cannot use sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Stalker (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a slayer gains his studied target bonus on Disguise, Intimidate, and Stealth checks against his studied opponent.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer can select one of the following advanced talents in place of a slayer talent.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a slayer can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. When moving at up to twice his normal speed while tracking, he takes only a &#150;10 penalty instead of the normal &#150;20.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer&#146;s Advance (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a slayer can once per day move up to twice his base speed as a move action. He may use Stealth as part of this movement, but takes a &#150;10 penalty to his check for doing so. At 17th level, he can do this twice per day.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a slayer can as a standard action denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a slayer can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he gains a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats against his quarry are automatically conf irmed. A slayer can have no more than one quarry at a time, and the target must be selected as a studied target. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry target for 24 hours. If the slayer sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry target after 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the slayer&#146;s ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Slayer (Ex): </b>At 20th level, the slayer becomes a master at capturing or killing his studied targets. As a standard action, he can make a single attack against a studied target at his full attack bonus, choosing one of the following effects: kill, knock unconscious for 1d4 hours, or paralyze for 2d6 rounds. If the attack succeeds, the target takes damage normally and must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or suffer the additional effect. The DC for this save is 10 + 1/2 the slayer&#146;s level + the slayer&#146;s Intelligence modifier. Whether or not the target succeeds, it cannot be targeted by this ability again (by any slayer) for 24 hours.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Woodland snipers are guardians of forest and grove, keeping vigil on their borders and hunting bounties and trespassers from the shelter of sturdy branches.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skilled at tracking down targets, slayers are consummate hunters, living for the chase and the deadly stroke that brings it to a close. Slayers spend most of their time honing their weapon skills, studying the habits and anatomy of foes, and practicing combat maneuvers.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The slayer is elusive, and good at finding the opportune time and location to strike. Combining the deadliest talents of rangers and rogues, a slayer&#146;s abilities are all about getting into combat, dealing with a target, and then getting back out again.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Ranger and rogue.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A slayer is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, as well as with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Studied Target (Ex): </b>A slayer can study an opponent he can see as a move action. The slayer then gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks attempted against that opponent, and a +1 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against it. The DCs of slayer class abilities against that opponent increase by 1. A slayer can only maintain these bonuses against one opponent at a time; these bonuses remain in effect until either the opponent is dead or the slayer studies a new target.</p>
			<p>If a slayer deals sneak attack damage to a target, he can study that target as an immediate action, allowing him to apply his studied target bonuses against that target (including to the normal weapon damage roll).</p>
			<p>At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the bonuses on weapon attack, damage rolls, and skill checks and to slayer DCs against a studied target increase by 1. In addition, at each such interval, the slayer is able to maintain these bonuses against an additional studied target at the same time. The slayer may discard this connection to a studied target as a free action, allowing him to study another target in its place.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a slayer can study an opponent as a move or swift action.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A slayer adds 1/2 his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer Talents: </b>As a slayer gains experience, he learns a number of talents that aid him and confound his foes. Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer gains one slayer talent. Unless otherwise noted, a slayer cannot select an individual talent more than once. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a slayer&#146;s sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision of which to use must be made before the attack roll is made.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>At 3rd level, whenever a woodland sniper makes a ranged attack against a creature within 30 feet that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), he deals an additional 1d6 points of damage. This damage increases by 1d6 every 3 levels thereafter. Should the woodland sniper score a critical hit with his ranged attack, this additional damage is not multiplied. A woodland sniper cannot use sneak attack with a melee attack.</p>
			<p>At 6th level and every 3rd level thereafter, the range at which he can make a sneak attack increases by 10 feet.</p>
			<p>At 3rd level, if a slayer catches an opponent unable to defend itself effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot for extra damage. The slayer&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime his target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the slayer flanks his target. This additional damage is 1d6 at 3rd level, and increases by 1d6 every 3 levels thereafter. Should the slayer score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this additional damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or unarmed strike), a slayer can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. He cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The slayer must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A slayer cannot use sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Still Shot (Ex): </b>At 7th level, when he has cover provided by one or more trees, the woodland sniper reduces the penalty on Stealth checks to remain hidden while sniping by half his slayer level.</p>
			<p>This replaces stalker.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer can select one of the following advanced talents in place of a slayer talent.</p>
			<p><b>Branchwalking (Ex): </b>At 11th level, the woodland sniper gains a climb speed equal to his base speed. In addition, at 13th level, he can move from one tree to another via connecting branches by adding 5 to the DC of an Acrobatics or Climb check to move within the canopy. The woodland sniper cannot end his movement on a branch that cannot support his weight.</p>
			<p>This replaces swift tracker and slayer&#146;s advance.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a slayer can as a standard action denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a slayer can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he gains a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats against his quarry are automatically conf irmed.

					<p>At 10th level, once per day when a witch killer observes a creature within 30 feet cast an arcane spell or use an arcane spell-like ability, he can use foster hatredOA on that character, or target one creature harmed by the arcane effect with vengeful outrageUM, identifying the caster as the enemy. He can use this ability twice per day at 15th level, and he can use this ability three times per day at 20th level.

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A slayer is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, as well as with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Studied Target (Ex): </b>A slayer can study an opponent he can see as a move action. The slayer then gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks attempted against that opponent, and a +1 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against it. The DCs of slayer class abilities against that opponent increase by 1. A slayer can only maintain these bonuses against one opponent at a time; these bonuses remain in effect until either the opponent is dead or the slayer studies a new target.</p>
			<p>If a slayer deals sneak attack damage to a target, he can study that target as an immediate action, allowing him to apply his studied target bonuses against that target (including to the normal weapon damage roll).</p>
			<p>At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the bonuses on weapon attack, damage rolls, and skill checks and to slayer DCs against a studied target increase by 1. In addition, at each such interval, the slayer is able to maintain these bonuses against an additional studied target at the same time. The slayer may discard this connection to a studied target as a free action, allowing him to study another target in its place.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a slayer can study an opponent as a move or swift action.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Witch (Ex): </b>A witch killer&#146;s studied combat bonus applies on Spellcraft checks and saving throws against arcane spells and spell-like abilities and hexes. This bonus is reduced by 1 (minimum 0) if the target is not an arcane spellcaster, or a being called or summoned by arcane magic. He does not gain the increases to the maximum number of studied targets he can have at a time normally attained at 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, but his bonuses still increase at those levels.</p>
			<p>This ability alters studied target.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A slayer adds 1/2 his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer Talents: </b>As a slayer gains experience, he learns a number of talents that aid him and confound his foes. Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (execpt 4th, 10th), a slayer gains one slayer talent. Unless otherwise noted, a slayer cannot select an individual talent more than once. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a slayer&#146;s sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision of which to use must be made before the attack roll is made.</p>
			<p><b>Superstitous (Ex): </b>Instead of being able to select ranger combat style feats as slayer talents, a witch killer can select any of the following barbarian rage powers as slayer talents, treating his slayer level as his barbarian level: clear mind, disruptiveAPG, eater of magicUC, spell sunderUC, spellbreakerAPG, sunder enchantmentUC, superstition, or witch hunterAPG. If the witch killer selects a rage power that can normally be used only once per rage (eater of magic, spell sunder, or sunder enchantment), he can use it once per day per 5 slayer levels he possesses, though no more than once per round in any event. The other rage powers affect the slayer constantly, though the superstition and witch hunter rage powers apply only against arcane spells and spell-like abilities and the creatures that use them.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>At 3rd level, if a slayer catches an opponent unable to defend itself effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot for extra damage. The slayer&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime his target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the slayer flanks his target. This additional damage is 1d6 at 3rd level, and increases by 1d6 every 3 levels thereafter. Should the slayer score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this additional damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or unarmed strike), a slayer can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. He cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The slayer must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A slayer cannot use sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Lingering Thrust (Ex): </b>At 4th level, when a witch killer&#146;s attack against an arcane spellcaster in the midst of casting forces the spellcaster to attempt a concentration check, the witch killer adds half his slayer level to the check&#146;s DC. When he makes a sneak attack against an arcane spellcaster, up to 1 point of sneak attack damage per slayer level counts as ongoing damage for the purpose of forcing the spellcaster to attempt concentration checks (the witch killer does not add half his slayer level to this DC).</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the slayer talent gained at 4th level.</p>
			<p><b>Scent Magic (Su): </b>At 5th level, a witch killer can detect arcane magic by scent. He can use detect magic at will (as per a paladin&#146;s ability to detect evil), but only against arcane magic, and the ability is scentbased and thus defeated by effects like negate aromaAPG. Even when he isn&#146;t concentrating on using his magic scent, when a creature within scent range casts an arcane spell (including arcane spell-like abilities or magic item effects), the witch killer automatically pinpoints the caster&#146;s location.</p>
			<p><b>Stalker (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a slayer gains his studied target bonus on Disguise, Intimidate, and Stealth checks against his studied opponent.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer can select one of the following advanced talents in place of a slayer talent.</p>
			<p><b>Burn the Witch (Sp): </b>At 10th level, once per day when a witch killer observes a creature within 30 feet cast an arcane spell or use an arcane spell-like ability, he can use foster hatredOA on that character, or target one creature harmed by the arcane effect with vengeful outrageUM, identifying the caster as the enemy. He can use this ability twice per day at 15th level, and he can use this ability three times per day at 20th level. The save DC is Charisma-based and uses the witch killer&#146;s slayer level as his caster level.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the slayer talent normally gained at 10th level.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a slayer can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. When moving at up to twice his normal speed while tracking, he takes only a &#150;10 penalty instead of the normal &#150;20.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer&#146;s Advance (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a slayer can once per day move up to twice his base speed as a move action. He may use Stealth as part of this movement, but takes a &#150;10 penalty to his check for doing so. At 17th level, he can do this twice per day.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a slayer can as a standard action denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a slayer can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he gains a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats against his quarry are automatically conf irmed. A slayer can have no more than one quarry at a time, and the target must be selected as a studied target. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry target for 24 hours. If the slayer sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry target after 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the slayer&#146;s ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Slayer (Ex): </b>At 20th level, the slayer becomes a master at capturing or killing his studied targets. As a standard action, he can make a single attack against a studied target at his full attack bonus, choosing one of the following effects: kill, knock unconscious for 1d4 hours, or paralyze for 2d6 rounds. If the attack succeeds, the target takes damage normally and must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or suffer the additional effect. The DC for this save is 10 + 1/2 the slayer&#146;s level + the slayer&#146;s Intelligence modifier. Whether or not the target succeeds, it cannot be targeted by this ability again (by any slayer) for 24 hours.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Velvet blades specialize in infiltrating the upper echelons of society, mingling with nobles and courtiers, and killing them. Velvet blades are often born into the aristocracy, with an intricate understanding of the inner workings of upperclass society. Though a few velvet blades are unhinged maniacs who enjoy preying on their peers, most of these well-heeled slayers assume a professional demeanor and hire themselves out to other nobles or well-connected criminal organizations.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skilled at tracking down targets, slayers are consummate hunters, living for the chase and the deadly stroke that brings it to a close. Slayers spend most of their time honing their weapon skills, studying the habits and anatomy of foes, and practicing combat maneuvers.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The slayer is elusive, and good at finding the opportune time and location to strike. Combining the deadliest talents of rangers and rogues, a slayer&#146;s abilities are all about getting into combat, dealing with a target, and then getting back out again.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Ranger and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Slayer's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A slayer is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, as well as with light armor.</p>
			<p><b>Courtly Graces (Ex): </b>A velvet blade spends long hours memorizing etiquette and family lineages of royalty and other prominent families. She gains a bonus on Knowledge (nobility checks) equal to half her slayer level (minimum +1).</p>
			<p>This ability replaces track.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Socialite (Ex): </b>A velvet blade focuses her studies on social infiltration rather than brute force, believing it is easier to kill an opponent quietly and unprepared than in a loud battle. She adds her studied target bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Disguise, Intimidate, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, Stealth, and Survival checks against studied opponents, as well as to the DCs of slayer class abilities she uses against such opponents. She never gains a bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls from her studied target ability.</p>
			<p>This ability alters studied target.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Target (Ex): </b>A slayer can study an opponent he can see as a move action. The slayer then gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks attempted against that opponent, and a +1 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against it. The DCs of slayer class abilities against that opponent increase by 1. A slayer can only maintain these bonuses against one opponent at a time; these bonuses remain in effect until either the opponent is dead or the slayer studies a new target.</p>
			<p>If a slayer deals sneak attack damage to a target, he can study that target as an immediate action, allowing him to apply his studied target bonuses against that target (including to the normal weapon damage roll).</p>
			<p>At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the bonuses on weapon attack, damage rolls, and skill checks and to slayer DCs against a studied target increase by 1. In addition, at each such interval, the slayer is able to maintain these bonuses against an additional studied target at the same time. The slayer may discard this connection to a studied target as a free action, allowing him to study another target in its place.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a slayer can study an opponent as a move or swift action.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer Talents: </b>As a slayer gains experience, he learns a number of talents that aid him and confound his foes. Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer gains one slayer talent. Unless otherwise noted, a slayer cannot select an individual talent more than once. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a slayer&#146;s sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision of which to use must be made before the attack roll is made.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>At 3rd level, if a slayer catches an opponent unable to defend itself effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot for extra damage. The slayer&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime his target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the slayer flanks his target. This additional damage is 1d6 at 3rd level, and increases by 1d6 every 3 levels thereafter. Should the slayer score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this additional damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or unarmed strike), a slayer can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. He cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The slayer must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A slayer cannot use sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Stalker (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a slayer gains his studied target bonus on Disguise, Intimidate, and Stealth checks against his studied opponent.</p>
			<p><b>Treacherous Blade (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a velvet blade can capitalize on how others underestimate her and allow her close to them, assuming she is harmless. She gains the BetrayerUC feat as a bonus feat, whether or not she meets the prerequisites. Additionally, when making her first attack against a studied target that believes her to be harmless or to be an ally, the attack counts as a sneak attack, even if the target isn&#146;t flanked or denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, and the velvet blade gains +2d6 sneak attack damage, increasing by 1d6 at 10th level and every 5 levels thereafter. Even if she immediately attacks the target again (such as by continuing a full attack), only the first attack gains these benefits, since the target immediately realizes the velvet blade is something more than she seemed.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer can select one of the following advanced talents in place of a slayer talent.</p>
			<p><b>Silent Dispatch (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a velvet blade becomes adept at taking out her targets quietly. She gains the silent dispatch vigilante talent without meeting the talent&#146;s prerequisites.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces swift tracker.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer&#146;s Advance (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a slayer can once per day move up to twice his base speed as a move action. He may use Stealth as part of this movement, but takes a &#150;10 penalty to his check for doing so. At 17th level, he can do this twice per day.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a slayer can as a standard action denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a slayer can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he gains a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats against his quarry are automatically conf irmed. A slayer can have no more than one quarry at a time, and the target must be selected as a studied target. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry target for 24 hours. If the slayer sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry target after 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the slayer&#146;s ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Slayer (Ex): </b>At 20th level, the slayer becomes a master at capturing or killing his studied targets. As a standard action, he can make a single attack against a studied target at his full attack bonus, choosing one of the following effects: kill, knock unconscious for 1d4 hours, or paralyze for 2d6 rounds. If the attack succeeds, the target takes damage normally and must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or suffer the additional effect. The DC for this save is 10 + 1/2 the slayer&#146;s level + the slayer&#146;s Intelligence modifier. Whether or not the target succeeds, it cannot be targeted by this ability again (by any slayer) for 24 hours.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Vanguards are battlefield commanders who focus on the brutality of combat and lead their allies to bloody victory. Quick to react to danger, a vanguard is a valuable scout, capable officer, and skilled tactician.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skilled at tracking down targets, slayers are consummate hunters, living for the chase and the deadly stroke that brings it to a close. Slayers spend most of their time honing their weapon skills, studying the habits and anatomy of foes, and practicing combat maneuvers.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The slayer is elusive, and good at finding the opportune time and location to strike. Combining the deadliest talents of rangers and rogues, a slayer&#146;s abilities are all about getting into combat, dealing with a target, and then getting back out again.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Ranger and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A slayer is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, as well as with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Lookout (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a vanguard adds 1/2 his level (minimum 1) to initiative checks. This ability replaces track.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Target (Ex): </b>A slayer can study an opponent he can see as a move action. The slayer then gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks attempted against that opponent, and a +1 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against it. The DCs of slayer class abilities against that opponent increase by 1. A slayer can only maintain these bonuses against one opponent at a time; these bonuses remain in effect until either the opponent is dead or the slayer studies a new target.</p>
			<p>If a slayer deals sneak attack damage to a target, he can study that target as an immediate action, allowing him to apply his studied target bonuses against that target (including to the normal weapon damage roll).</p>
			<p>At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the bonuses on weapon attack, damage rolls, and skill checks and to slayer DCs against a studied target increase by 1. In addition, at each such interval, the slayer is able to maintain these bonuses against an additional studied target at the same time. The slayer may discard this connection to a studied target as a free action, allowing him to study another target in its place.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a slayer can study an opponent as a move or swift action.</p>
			<p><b>Tactician (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a vanguard receives a teamwork feat as a bonus feat. He must meet the prerequisites for this feat. Once per day as a standard action, the vanguard can grant one of his teamwork feats to all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear him. Allies retain the use of this bonus feat for 3 rounds plus 1 round for every 2 levels the vanguard possesses. Allies do not need to meet the prerequisites of this bonus feat. Whenever the vanguard is able to select a new slayer talent, he can instead choose to gain an additional use per day of this ability. This ability replaces the slayer talent gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>At 3rd level, if a slayer catches an opponent unable to defend itself effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot for extra damage. The slayer&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime his target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the slayer flanks his target. This additional damage is 1d6 at 3rd level, and increases by 1d6 every 3 levels thereafter. Should the slayer score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this additional damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or unarmed strike), a slayer can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. He cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The slayer must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A slayer cannot use sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Vanguard&#146;s Bond (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a vanguard forms a bond with his fighting companions. As a move action, he can choose one of his current studied targets and grant half his studied target bonus against that target to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the slayer&#146;s Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy or studied target bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher. This ability replaces the slayer talent gained at 4th level.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer Talents: </b>As a slayer gains experience, he learns a number of talents that aid him and confound his foes. Starting at 6th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer gains one slayer talent. Unless otherwise noted, a slayer cannot select an individual talent more than once. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a slayer&#146;s sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision of which to use must be made before the attack roll is made.</p>
			<p><b>Ever Ready (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a vanguard is never considered an unaware combatant (Core Rulebook 178) and is always able to act in the surprise round. The vanguard is still flat-footed in the surprise round until he acts. This ability replaces stalker.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer can select one of the following advanced talents in place of a slayer talent.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a slayer can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. When moving at up to twice his normal speed while tracking, he takes only a &#150;10 penalty instead of the normal &#150;20.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer&#146;s Advance (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a slayer can once per day move up to twice his base speed as a move action. He may use Stealth as part of this movement, but takes a &#150;10 penalty to his check for doing so. At 17th level, he can do this twice per day.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a slayer can as a standard action denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>In Sekamina, betraying others before they have the chance to betray you can be a necessary survival technique. While not all adventurers have the heart for such underhanded dealings, others have developed a knack for it. The turncoat&#146;s natural talents for deception and treachery are fitting when negotiating with the untrustworthy inhabitants of Sekamina and other notoriously unscrupulous areas, and his ability to adapt allows him to preempt opponents&#146; schemes. Not all party members may be comfortable with having someone so adept at backstabbing among their ranks, but most tend to be grateful that he uses his skills to their benefit.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skilled at tracking down targets, slayers are consummate hunters, living for the chase and the deadly stroke that brings it to a close. Slayers spend most of their time honing their weapon skills, studying the habits and anatomy of foes, and practicing combat maneuvers.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The slayer is elusive, and good at finding the opportune time and location to strike. Combining the deadliest talents of rangers and rogues, a slayer&#146;s abilities are all about getting into combat, dealing with a target, and then getting back out again.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Ranger and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Slayer's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Disguise (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A slayer is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, as well as with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Dubious Recognition (Ex): </b>A turncoat adds half his level (minimum 1) to Sense Motive checks to recognize when a creature is lying or attempting to take advantage of the turncoat and his allies.</p>
			<p>This replaces track.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Target (Ex): </b>A slayer can study an opponent he can see as a move action. The slayer then gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks attempted against that opponent, and a +1 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against it. The DCs of slayer class abilities against that opponent increase by 1. A slayer can only maintain these bonuses against one opponent at a time; these bonuses remain in effect until either the opponent is dead or the slayer studies a new target.</p>
			<p>If a slayer deals sneak attack damage to a target, he can study that target as an immediate action, allowing him to apply his studied target bonuses against that target (including to the normal weapon damage roll).</p>
			<p>At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the bonuses on weapon attack, damage rolls, and skill checks and to slayer DCs against a studied target increase by 1. In addition, at each such interval, the slayer is able to maintain these bonuses against an additional studied target at the same time. The slayer may discard this connection to a studied target as a free action, allowing him to study another target in its place.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a slayer can study an opponent as a move or swift action.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer Talents: </b>As a slayer gains experience, he learns a number of talents that aid him and confound his foes. Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer gains one slayer talent. Unless otherwise noted, a slayer cannot select an individual talent more than once. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a slayer&#146;s sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision of which to use must be made before the attack roll is made.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>At 3rd level, if a slayer catches an opponent unable to defend itself effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot for extra damage. The slayer&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime his target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the slayer flanks his target. This additional damage is 1d6 at 3rd level, and increases by 1d6 every 3 levels thereafter. Should the slayer score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this additional damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or unarmed strike), a slayer can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. He cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The slayer must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A slayer cannot use sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Double Speak (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a turncoat can attempt a Bluff check in place of a Diplomacy check against a studied target. The target can attempt an opposed Sense Motive check.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces stalker.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer can select one of the following advanced talents in place of a slayer talent.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a slayer can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. When moving at up to twice his normal speed while tracking, he takes only a &#150;10 penalty instead of the normal &#150;20.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer&#146;s Advance (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a slayer can once per day move up to twice his base speed as a move action. He may use Stealth as part of this movement, but takes a &#150;10 penalty to his check for doing so. At 17th level, he can do this twice per day.</p>
			<p><b>Sudden Betrayal (Ex): </b>At 14th level, as a standard action a turncoat can choose a single creature within 30 feet. He gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks against this target. If the target has an attitude of indifferent or better toward him, the first attack roll the turncoat makes against that target is automatically treated as threatening a critical hit. If the target&#146;s attitude is friendly or better, a successful attack is treated as a confirmed critical hit. This ability can be used only once per day.</p>
			<p>At 19th level, the bonus increases to +6, and the attack is treated as a confirmed critical hit if the target is at least indifferent to the turncoat.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces quarry and improved quarry.</p>
			<p><b>Master Slayer (Ex): </b>At 20th level, the slayer becomes a master at capturing or killing his studied targets. As a standard action, he can make a single attack against a studied target at his full attack bonus, choosing one of the following effects: kill, knock unconscious for 1d4 hours, or paralyze for 2d6 rounds. If the attack succeeds, the target takes damage normally and must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or suffer the additional effect. The DC for this save is 10 + 1/2 the slayer&#146;s level + the slayer&#146;s Intelligence modifier. Whether or not the target succeeds, it cannot be targeted by this ability again (by any slayer) for 24 hours.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A toxic sniper is proficient with all simple weapons and firearms. He is proficient with light armor. This alters the toxic sniper&#146;s weapon and armor proficiency.</p>
			<p><b>Scrapper&#146;s Gun: </b>A toxic sniper gains the Gunsmithing feat, a battered gun identical to that gained by a 1st-level gunslinger, and the ability to restore his battered gun as if he were a gunslinger.</p>
			<p>This replaces track.</p>
			<p><b>Sharpshooter&#146;s Study (Ex): </b>A toxic sniper&#146;s focus makes him extremely deadly with ranged weapons. He gains a bonus on attack and damage rolls against his studied target only when attacking with a ranged weapon.</p>
			<p>This alters studied target.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Target (Ex): </b>A slayer can study an opponent he can see as a move action. The slayer then gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks attempted against that opponent, and a +1 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against it. The DCs of slayer class abilities against that opponent increase by 1. A slayer can only maintain these bonuses against one opponent at a time; these bonuses remain in effect until either the opponent is dead or the slayer studies a new target.</p>
			<p>If a slayer deals sneak attack damage to a target, he can study that target as an immediate action, allowing him to apply his studied target bonuses against that target (including to the normal weapon damage roll).</p>
			<p>At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the bonuses on weapon attack, damage rolls, and skill checks and to slayer DCs against a studied target increase by 1. In addition, at each such interval, the slayer is able to maintain these bonuses against an additional studied target at the same time. The slayer may discard this connection to a studied target as a free action, allowing him to study another target in its place.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a slayer can study an opponent as a move or swift action.</p>
			<p><b>Toxic Grit (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, the toxic sniper gains the Amateur Gunslinger feat as a bonus feat.</p>
			<p>This replaces the slayer talent gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>At 3rd level, if a slayer catches an opponent unable to defend itself effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot for extra damage. The slayer&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime his target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the slayer flanks his target. This additional damage is 1d6 at 3rd level, and increases by 1d6 every 3 levels thereafter. Should the slayer score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this additional damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or unarmed strike), a slayer can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. He cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The slayer must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A slayer cannot use sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Toxic Shots (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a toxic sniper can coat his ammunition in poison without requiring a pitted bullet. He is trained in applying poison in this way and cannot accidentally poison himself when applying poison to his ammunition. The toxic sniper can create a number of toxic shots per day equal to half his slayer level plus his Wisdom modifier. The penetrating nature of a toxic shot increases the DC of any poisons applied in this way by 2. A toxic sniper cannot create a toxic shot that is part of an alchemical cartridge.</p>
			<p>This replaces the slayer talent gained at 4th level.</p>
			<p><b>Marksman (Ex): </b>At 6th level, a toxic sniper reduces the penalty on Stealth checks while sniping by 5. He reduces the penalty by 5 again at 12th level and at 18th level. At 8th level, he increases the distance from which he can deliver a ranged sneak attack against his studied target by 10 feet. This increases by 10 feet again at 14th level and at 20th level.</p>
			<p>This replaces slayer talents gained at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, and 20th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Stalker (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a slayer gains his studied target bonus on Disguise, Intimidate, and Stealth checks against his studied opponent.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer can select one of the following advanced talents in place of a slayer talent.</p>
			<p><b>Precise Toxin (Ex): </b>At 10th level, a toxic sniper can deliver a toxic shot to especially vulnerable areas. When he hits an opponent with a toxic shot and deals sneak attack damage, he can forgo all his bonus damage to increase the DC of the his toxic shot&#146;s poison. The DC increases by 1 for every 2d6 points of sneak attack damage he forgoes in this way.</p>
			<p>This replaces the slayer talent gained at 10th level.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a slayer can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. When moving at up to twice his normal speed while tracking, he takes only a &#150;10 penalty instead of the normal &#150;20.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer&#146;s Advance (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a slayer can once per day move up to twice his base speed as a move action. He may use Stealth as part of this movement, but takes a &#150;10 penalty to his check for doing so. At 17th level, he can do this twice per day.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a slayer can as a standard action denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a slayer can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he gains a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats against his quarry are automatically conf irmed. A slayer can have no more than one quarry at a time, and the target must be selected as a studied target. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry target for 24 hours. If the slayer sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry target after 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the slayer&#146;s ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Slayer (Ex): </b>At 20th level, the slayer becomes a master at capturing or killing his studied targets. As a standard action, he can make a single attack against a studied target at his full attack bonus, choosing one of the following effects: kill, knock unconscious for 1d4 hours, or paralyze for 2d6 rounds. If the attack succeeds, the target takes damage normally and must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or suffer the additional effect. The DC for this save is 10 + 1/2 the slayer&#146;s level + the slayer&#146;s Intelligence modifier. Whether or not the target succeeds, it cannot be targeted by this ability again (by any slayer) for 24 hours.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A stygian slayer crawls out of the darkest shadows to strike fear into the hearts of civilized folk. He&#146;s a merciless killer who can control a sliver of magic, allowing him to arrive unseen, commit murder, and depart without detection.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skilled at tracking down targets, slayers are consummate hunters, living for the chase and the deadly stroke that brings it to a close. Slayers spend most of their time honing their weapon skills, studying the habits and anatomy of foes, and practicing combat maneuvers.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The slayer is elusive, and good at finding the opportune time and location to strike. Combining the deadliest talents of rangers and rogues, a slayer&#146;s abilities are all about getting into combat, dealing with a target, and then getting back out again.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Ranger and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Slayer's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Disguise (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A slayer is proficient with all simple and martial weapons. A stygian slayer is proficient with light armor, but not with medium armor, heavy armor, or any kind of shield (including tower shields). This replaces the slayer&#146;s armor proficiency.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Target (Ex): </b>A slayer can study an opponent he can see as a move action. The slayer then gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks attempted against that opponent, and a +1 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against it. The DCs of slayer class abilities against that opponent increase by 1. A slayer can only maintain these bonuses against one opponent at a time; these bonuses remain in effect until either the opponent is dead or the slayer studies a new target.</p>
			<p>If a slayer deals sneak attack damage to a target, he can study that target as an immediate action, allowing him to apply his studied target bonuses against that target (including to the normal weapon damage roll).</p>
			<p>At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the bonuses on weapon attack, damage rolls, and skill checks and to slayer DCs against a studied target increase by 1. In addition, at each such interval, the slayer is able to maintain these bonuses against an additional studied target at the same time. The slayer may discard this connection to a studied target as a free action, allowing him to study another target in its place.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a slayer can study an opponent as a move or swift action.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A slayer adds 1/2 his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer Talents: </b>As a slayer gains experience, he learns a number of talents that aid him and confound his foes. Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (execpt 4th and 10th), a slayer gains one slayer talent. Unless otherwise noted, a slayer cannot select an individual talent more than once. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a slayer&#146;s sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision of which to use must be made before the attack roll is made.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>At 3rd level, if a slayer catches an opponent unable to defend itself effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot for extra damage. The slayer&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime his target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the slayer flanks his target. This additional damage is 1d6 at 3rd level, and increases by 1d6 every 3 levels thereafter. Should the slayer score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this additional damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or unarmed strike), a slayer can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. He cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The slayer must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A slayer cannot use sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Invisibility (Sp): </b>At 4th level, a stygian slayer can cast invisibility once per day, using his slayer level as his caster level. The slayer uses his Intelligence modifier for concentration checks when using this ability. The slayer can use this an additional time per day at 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter. This ability replaces the slayer talent gained at 4th level.</p>
			<p><b>Spell Use: </b>At 7th level, a stygian slayer is able to use spell completion and spell trigger items as if he were an arcane caster with these spells on his spell list: darkness, forced quietUM, modify memory, nondetection, obscuring mist, phantom steed, shadow walk, and wizard spells of the illusion school of spell level 0 through 4th. The slayer&#146;s uses his class level as his caster level for this ability. This ability replaces stalker.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer can select one of the following advanced talents in place of a slayer talent.</p>
			<p><b>Shadowy Mist Form (Sp): </b>At 10th level, a stygian slayer can transform into an inky black cloud of mist. This functions as gaseous form, except it also obscures vision as fog cloud. The slayer can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to his level. These minutes need not be consecutive, but must be used in 1-minute increments. This ability replaces the advanced slayer talent gained at 10th level.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a slayer can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. When moving at up to twice his normal speed while tracking, he takes only a &#150;10 penalty instead of the normal &#150;20.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer&#146;s Advance (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a slayer can once per day move up to twice his base speed as a move action. He may use Stealth as part of this movement, but takes a &#150;10 penalty to his check for doing so. At 17th level, he can do this twice per day.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a slayer can as a standard action denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a slayer can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he gains a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats against his quarry are automatically conf irmed. A slayer can have no more than one quarry at a time, and the target must be selected as a studied target. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry target for 24 hours. If the slayer sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry target after 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the slayer&#146;s ability to hunt his quarry improves.

			<p><b>Master Slayer (Ex): </b>At 20th level, the slayer becomes a master at capturing or killing his studied targets. As a standard action, he can make a single attack against a studied target at his full attack bonus, choosing one of the following effects: kill, knock unconscious for 1d4 hours, or paralyze for 2d6 rounds. If the attack succeeds, the target takes damage normally and must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or suffer the additional effect. The DC for this save is 10 + 1/2 the slayer&#146;s level + the slayer&#146;s Intelligence modifier. Whether or not the target succeeds, it cannot be targeted by this ability again (by any slayer) for 24 hours.</p>

					<p><i>Improved Spirit Sense: </i>A spiritslayer who selects this talent gains Improved Blind-FightAPG as a bonus feat, ignoring its prerequisites. In addition, he adds 1/2 his slayer level on Perception checks to pinpoint the location of an invisible creature. He can use Perception to pinpoint the location of an ethereal creature, but he doesn&#146;t gain this bonus on Perception checks when doing so. A spiritslayer must be at least 6th level before selecting this talent.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Originally trained and employed by the enforcers of the Pure Legion seeking to defend Rahadoum from divine spellcasters, Rahadoumi spiritslayers have proven so invaluable in culling ghosts, shadow demons, and other incorporeal creatures that their techniques have spread across the Inner Sea region and beyond. Ironically, most now are trained and employed by the church of Pharasma to cull wicked spirits.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skilled at tracking down targets, slayers are consummate hunters, living for the chase and the deadly stroke that brings it to a close. Slayers spend most of their time honing their weapon skills, studying the habits and anatomy of foes, and practicing combat maneuvers.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The slayer is elusive, and good at finding the opportune time and location to strike. Combining the deadliest talents of rangers and rogues, a slayer&#146;s abilities are all about getting into combat, dealing with a target, and then getting back out again.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Ranger and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Slayer's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Disguise (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A slayer is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, as well as with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Studied Target (Ex): </b>A slayer can study an opponent he can see as a move action. The slayer then gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks attempted against that opponent, and a +1 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against it. The DCs of slayer class abilities against that opponent increase by 1. A slayer can only maintain these bonuses against one opponent at a time; these bonuses remain in effect until either the opponent is dead or the slayer studies a new target.</p>
			<p>If a slayer deals sneak attack damage to a target, he can study that target as an immediate action, allowing him to apply his studied target bonuses against that target (including to the normal weapon damage roll).</p>
			<p>At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the bonuses on weapon attack, damage rolls, and skill checks and to slayer DCs against a studied target increase by 1. In addition, at each such interval, the slayer is able to maintain these bonuses against an additional studied target at the same time. The slayer may discard this connection to a studied target as a free action, allowing him to study another target in its place.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a slayer can study an opponent as a move or swift action.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A slayer adds 1/2 his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Spirit Sense (Ex) : </b>At 2nd level, a spiritslayer manifests an uncanny sixth sense regarding the presence of invisible creatures. He gains Blind-Fight as a bonus feat and ignores the usual +20 bonus to the DC of any Perception check to pinpoint the location of an invisible creature. If the spiritslayer manages to pinpoint an invisible creature&#146;s location using a Perception check, he can study that creature with his studied target ability as a swift action.</p>
			<p>In addition, whenever the spiritslayer studies a possessed creature, he can automatically switch his studied target from the possessed creature to the possessing entity should that entity be expelled from his studied target. A spiritslayer adds his studied target bonus on attack rolls to all saving throws he attempts against possession effects used by his studied targets.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the slayer talent gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>At 3rd level, if a slayer catches an opponent unable to defend itself effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot for extra damage. The slayer&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime his target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the slayer flanks his target. This additional damage is 1d6 at 3rd level, and increases by 1d6 every 3 levels thereafter. Should the slayer score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this additional damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or unarmed strike), a slayer can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. He cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The slayer must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A slayer cannot use sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer Talents: </b>As a slayer gains experience, he learns a number of talents that aid him and confound his foes. Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer gains one slayer talent. Unless otherwise noted, a slayer cannot select an individual talent more than once. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a slayer&#146;s sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision of which to use must be made before the attack roll is made.</p>
			<p><b>Spiritslayer Talents : </b>A spiritslayer can select the following slayer talents, in addition to general slayer talents.</p>
			<p><i>Disrupt Possession (Ex): </i>Whenever a spiritslayer with this talent deals sneak attack damage to a creature that is being possessed, he also deals his sneak attack damage to the possessing entity. Once per round, a possessed creature that is damaged by disrupt possession can attempt a new Will saving throw to end the possession, gaining a +1 bonus on its save for each sneak attack damage die the spiritslayer rolled. This talent alters the spiritslayer&#146;s sneak attack, and doesn&#146;t stack with other talents that alter sneak attack. A spiritslayer must be at least 8th level before selecting this talent.</p>
			<p><i>Greater Spirit Sense: </i>A spiritslayer who selects this talent gains Greater Blind-FightAPG as a bonus feat, ignoring its prerequisites. In addition, he adds 1/2 his slayer level to his Perception checks to pinpoint the location of ethereal creatures, and once per round he can attempt a Perception check to pinpoint the locations of all invisible creatures within 30 feet of him without needing to take an action. A spiritslayer must be at least 10th level and have the improved spirit sense spiritslayer talent before selecting this talent.</p>
			<p><i>Improved Spirit Sense: </i>A spiritslayer who selects this talent gains Improved Blind-FightAPG as a bonus feat, ignoring its prerequisites. In addition, he adds 1/2 his slayer level on Perception checks to pinpoint the location of an invisible creature. He can use Perception to pinpoint the location of an ethereal creature, but he doesn&#146;t gain this bonus on Perception checks when doing so. A spiritslayer must be at least 6th level before selecting this talent.</p>
			<p><b>Ghost Slayer (Ex) : </b>At 7th level, whenever a spiritslayer makes an outsider or undead creature with the incorporeal subtype his studied target, his attacks count as magic for the purpose of striking that creature (though this doesn&#146;t give his attacks an enhancement bonus) and he can deal precision-based damage to such creatures (though his precision damage is reduced by 50% unless he has a means to bypass the creature&#146;s reduction in damage from corporeal sources, such as a ghost touch weapon). At 14th level, the spiritslayer&#146;s attacks against outsiders or undead creatures with the incorporeal subtype ignore the 50% reduction in damage from magical corporeal sources that such creatures have and can deal precision-based damage to incorporeal creatures.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces stalker.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer can select one of the following advanced talents in place of a slayer talent.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a slayer can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. When moving at up to twice his normal speed while tracking, he takes only a &#150;10 penalty instead of the normal &#150;20.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer&#146;s Advance (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a slayer can once per day move up to twice his base speed as a move action. He may use Stealth as part of this movement, but takes a &#150;10 penalty to his check for doing so. At 17th level, he can do this twice per day.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a slayer can as a standard action denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a slayer can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he gains a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats against his quarry are automatically conf irmed. A slayer can have no more than one quarry at a time, and the target must be selected as a studied target. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry target for 24 hours. If the slayer sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry target after 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the slayer&#146;s ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Slayer (Ex): </b>At 20th level, the slayer becomes a master at capturing or killing his studied targets. As a standard action, he can make a single attack against a studied target at his full attack bonus, choosing one of the following effects: kill, knock unconscious for 1d4 hours, or paralyze for 2d6 rounds. If the attack succeeds, the target takes damage normally and must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or suffer the additional effect. The DC for this save is 10 + 1/2 the slayer&#146;s level + the slayer&#146;s Intelligence modifier. Whether or not the target succeeds, it cannot be targeted by this ability again (by any slayer) for 24 hours.</p>

					<p>A spire diver does not gain the ability to add her studied target bonus on Bluff and Survival checks against an opponent she has studied. At 7th level, she cannot add her studied target bonus on Disguise checks. Instead, when using any bow or crossbow against her studied target underwater, the spire diver ignores the normal penalty for shooting underwater and instead treats the weapon as though its range increment were 10 feet.

					<p>As a slayer gains experience, he learns a number of talents that aid him and confound his foes. Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer gains one slayer talent. Unless otherwise noted, a slayer cannot select an individual talent more than once. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a slayer&#146;s sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision of which to use must be made before the attack roll is made.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Peerless divers, assassins, and scouts, spire divers operate in and out of water using the same weapons and equipment. Although the elves of the Mordant Spire originally developed the techniques that spire divers use, people living in coastal areas and archipelagos near the Mwangi Expanse and Tian Xia have similar, independently developed warrior and diving traditions.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skilled at tracking down targets, slayers are consummate hunters, living for the chase and the deadly stroke that brings it to a close. Slayers spend most of their time honing their weapon skills, studying the habits and anatomy of foes, and practicing combat maneuvers.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The slayer is elusive, and good at finding the opportune time and location to strike. Combining the deadliest talents of rangers and rogues, a slayer&#146;s abilities are all about getting into combat, dealing with a target, and then getting back out again.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Ranger and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Slayer's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Disguise (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A slayer is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, as well as with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Hold Breath (Ex): </b>A spire diver increases the number of rounds she can hold her breath before she is required to start attempting Constitution checks to avoid drowning by 2 per slayer level she has.</p>
			<p>This replaces track.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Target (Ex): </b>A slayer can study an opponent he can see as a move action. The slayer then gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks attempted against that opponent, and a +1 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against it. The DCs of slayer class abilities against that opponent increase by 1. A slayer can only maintain these bonuses against one opponent at a time; these bonuses remain in effect until either the opponent is dead or the slayer studies a new target.</p>
			<p>If a slayer deals sneak attack damage to a target, he can study that target as an immediate action, allowing him to apply his studied target bonuses against that target (including to the normal weapon damage roll).</p>
			<p>At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the bonuses on weapon attack, damage rolls, and skill checks and to slayer DCs against a studied target increase by 1. In addition, at each such interval, the slayer is able to maintain these bonuses against an additional studied target at the same time. The slayer may discard this connection to a studied target as a free action, allowing him to study another target in its place.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a slayer can study an opponent as a move or swift action.</p>
			<p>A spire diver does not gain the ability to add her studied target bonus on Bluff and Survival checks against an opponent she has studied. At 7th level, she cannot add her studied target bonus on Disguise checks. Instead, when using any bow or crossbow against her studied target underwater, the spire diver ignores the normal penalty for shooting underwater and instead treats the weapon as though its range increment were 10 feet. At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the range increment increases by 10 feet, to a maximum of 50 feet.</p>
			<p>When using a bow or crossbow that already has an underwater range increment, such as an underwater crossbow, the spire diver adds the range increment gained from studied target as a bonus to the weapon&#146;s usual underwater range increment, though the combined range increment cannot exceed the weapon&#146;s normal range increment.</p>
			<p>This alters studied target and stalker.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer Talents: </b>As a slayer gains experience, he learns a number of talents that aid him and confound his foes. Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer gains one slayer talent. Unless otherwise noted, a slayer cannot select an individual talent more than once. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a slayer&#146;s sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision of which to use must be made before the attack roll is made.</p>
			<p>A spire diver can select the strong stroke rogue talent as a slayer talent.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>At 3rd level, if a slayer catches an opponent unable to defend itself effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot for extra damage. The slayer&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime his target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the slayer flanks his target. This additional damage is 1d6 at 3rd level, and increases by 1d6 every 3 levels thereafter. Should the slayer score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this additional damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or unarmed strike), a slayer can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. He cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The slayer must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A slayer cannot use sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Stalker (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a slayer gains his studied target bonus on Disguise, Intimidate, and Stealth checks against his studied opponent.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer can select one of the following advanced talents in place of a slayer talent.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Swimmer (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a spire diver gains a swim speed equal to her base speed.</p>
			<p>This replaces swift tracker.</p>
			<p><b>Diver&#146;s Advance (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a spire diver can swim up to twice her swim speed once per day as a move action. She can use Stealth as part of this movement but takes a &#150;10 penalty on her check for doing so. At 17th level, she can use this ability twice per day.</p>
			<p>This replaces slayer&#146;s advance.</p>
			<p><b>Diver&#146;s Quarry (Ex): </b>A spire diver gains quarry and improved quarry as a normal slayer, but she does not gain the ability to take 10 or take 20 on Survival checks while moving at normal speed without penalty. Instead, at 14th level, a spire diver can take 10 on Knowledge checks to identify a monster she has selected as her quarry. At 19th level, she can take 20 on these checks without spending extra time to do so. The spire diver must be trained in the appropriate Knowledge skill to use this ability.</p>
			<p>This alters quarry and improved quarry.</p>
			<p><b>Master Slayer (Ex): </b>At 20th level, the slayer becomes a master at capturing or killing his studied targets.

The DC for this save is 10 + 1/2 the slayer&#146;s level + the slayer&#146;s Intelligence modifier. Whether or not the target succeeds, it cannot be targeted by this ability again (by any slayer) for 24 hours.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Generations of Ninshaburian warriors fought the Spawn of Rovagug, holding the line against impossible odds. Some of their ancient techniques persist to this day.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skilled at tracking down targets, slayers are consummate hunters, living for the chase and the deadly stroke that brings it to a close. Slayers spend most of their time honing their weapon skills, studying the habits and anatomy of foes, and practicing combat maneuvers.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The slayer is elusive, and good at finding the opportune time and location to strike. Combining the deadliest talents of rangers and rogues, a slayer&#146;s abilities are all about getting into combat, dealing with a target, and then getting back out again.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Ranger and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Slayer's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Disguise (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>

At 15th level, if the target is Gargantuan or larger, the bonuses increase by an additional 3. At 20th level, if the target is Colossal in size, the bonuses increase by an additional 4. A spawn slayer cannot maintain these bonuses against more than one target at a time. He does not gain the ability to study an opponent as a swift action at 7th level.</p>
			<p>This alters studied target.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A slayer adds 1/2 his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer Talents: </b>As a slayer gains experience, he learns a number of talents that aid him and confound his foes. Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer gains one slayer talent. Unless otherwise noted, a slayer cannot select an individual talent more than once. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a slayer&#146;s sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision of which to use must be made before the attack roll is made.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>At 3rd level, if a slayer catches an opponent unable to defend itself effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot for extra damage. The slayer&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime his target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the slayer flanks his target. This additional damage is 1d6 at 3rd level, and increases by 1d6 every 3 levels thereafter. Should the slayer score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this additional damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or unarmed strike), a slayer can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. He cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The slayer must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A slayer cannot use sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Gain Leverage (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a spawn slayer learns techniques to counteract a foe&#146;s size advantage. When performing a combat maneuver against a studied target of Large or larger size, the spawn slayer gains a bonus on the check equal to the creature&#146;s size modifier to CMB (Large +1, Huge +2, Gargantuan +4, and Colossal +8). The spawn slayer adds this same bonus to his CMD when defending against combat maneuvers from a Large or larger studied target.</p>
			<p>This replaces stalker.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer can select one of the following advanced talents in place of a slayer talent.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a slayer can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. When moving at up to twice his normal speed while tracking, he takes only a &#150;10 penalty instead of the normal &#150;20.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer&#146;s Advance (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a slayer can once per day move up to twice his base speed as a move action. He may use Stealth as part of this movement, but takes a &#150;10 penalty to his check for doing so. At 17th level, he can do this twice per day.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a slayer can as a standard action denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a slayer can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he gains a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats against his quarry are automatically conf irmed. A slayer can have no more than one quarry at a time, and the target must be selected as a studied target. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry target for 24 hours. If the slayer sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry target after 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the slayer&#146;s ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Force Vulnerability (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a spawn slayer can create an opening in even an invulnerable foe&#146;s defenses. As a standard action, he can make a single attack against a studied target at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the damage bypasses any damage reduction and the target must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC 10 + half the slayer&#146;s level + the slayer&#146;s Intelligence modifier) or lose one of its defensive abilities for 2d6 rounds. The slayer can choose which defensive ability is lost from the following options: a single immunity, all resistances, regeneration, or spell resistance. Whether or not the target fails this save, it cannot be targeted by force vulnerability again (by you or another slayer) for 24 hours.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Whether it&#146;s with a bullet from a sling, a quarrel from a crossbow, or even an expertly thrown dagger, the sniper ensures that a single shot disables his targets.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skilled at tracking down targets, slayers are consummate hunters, living for the chase and the deadly stroke that brings it to a close. Slayers spend most of their time honing their weapon skills, studying the habits and anatomy of foes, and practicing combat maneuvers.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The slayer is elusive, and good at finding the opportune time and location to strike. Combining the deadliest talents of rangers and rogues, a slayer&#146;s abilities are all about getting into combat, dealing with a target, and then getting back out again.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Ranger and rogue.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A slayer is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, as well as with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Accuracy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a sniper halves all range increment penalties when making ranged attacks with a bow, crossbow, or firearm. This ability replaces track.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Target (Ex): </b>A slayer can study an opponent he can see as a move action. The slayer then gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks attempted against that opponent, and a +1 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against it. The DCs of slayer class abilities against that opponent increase by 1. A slayer can only maintain these bonuses against one opponent at a time; these bonuses remain in effect until either the opponent is dead or the slayer studies a new target.</p>
			<p>If a slayer deals sneak attack damage to a target, he can study that target as an immediate action, allowing him to apply his studied target bonuses against that target (including to the normal weapon damage roll).</p>
			<p>At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the bonuses on weapon attack, damage rolls, and skill checks and to slayer DCs against a studied target increase by 1. In addition, at each such interval, the slayer is able to maintain these bonuses against an additional studied target at the same time. The slayer may discard this connection to a studied target as a free action, allowing him to study another target in its place.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a slayer can study an opponent as a move or swift action.</p>
			<p><b>Deadly Sniper (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, when the sniper makes an attack against a target who is within his weapon&#146;s first range increment and completely unaware of his presence, that attack ignores the 30 foot range limit on ranged sneak attacks, and if it is a sneak attack, he adds his sniper level as a bonus on his sneak attack damage roll. After this first attack, the target is aware of the sniper&#146;s presence.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>At 3rd level, if a slayer catches an opponent unable to defend itself effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot for extra damage. The slayer&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime his target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the slayer flanks his target. This additional damage is 1d6 at 3rd level, and increases by 1d6 every 3 levels thereafter. Should the slayer score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this additional damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or unarmed strike), a slayer can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. He cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The slayer must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A slayer cannot use sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer Talents: </b>As a slayer gains experience, he learns a number of talents that aid him and confound his foes. Starting at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer gains one slayer talent. Unless otherwise noted, a slayer cannot select an individual talent more than once. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a slayer&#146;s sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision of which to use must be made before the attack roll is made.</p>
			<p><b>Stalker (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a slayer gains his studied target bonus on Disguise, Intimidate, and Stealth checks against his studied opponent.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer can select one of the following advanced talents in place of a slayer talent.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a slayer can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. When moving at up to twice his normal speed while tracking, he takes only a &#150;10 penalty instead of the normal &#150;20.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer&#146;s Advance (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a slayer can once per day move up to twice his base speed as a move action. He may use Stealth as part of this movement, but takes a &#150;10 penalty to his check for doing so. At 17th level, he can do this twice per day.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a slayer can as a standard action denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a slayer can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he gains a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats against his quarry are automatically conf irmed. A slayer can have no more than one quarry at a time, and the target must be selected as a studied target. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry target for 24 hours. If the slayer sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry target after 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the slayer&#146;s ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Slayer (Ex): </b>At 20th level, the slayer becomes a master at capturing or killing his studied targets. As a standard action, he can make a single attack against a studied target at his full attack bonus, choosing one of the following effects: kill, knock unconscious for 1d4 hours, or paralyze for 2d6 rounds.

The DC for this save is 10 + 1/2 the slayer&#146;s level + the slayer&#146;s Intelligence modifier.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>These professional killers are trained and used almost exclusively by the various Sczarni crime families. Streetwise and ruthless, they operate independently, often making their talents available to the highest bidder. Though a few unscrupulous Sczarni executioners exploit this arrangement and force families to pay higher rates for their services, most of these assassins follow a strict personal code and maintain absolute transparency with their employers.</i></p>
			<p><i>Talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to a slayer&#146;s sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision of which to use must be made before the attack roll is made.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skilled at tracking down targets, slayers are consummate hunters, living for the chase and the deadly stroke that brings it to a close. Slayers spend most of their time honing their weapon skills, studying the habits and anatomy of foes, and practicing combat maneuvers.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The slayer is elusive, and good at finding the opportune time and location to strike. Combining the deadliest talents of rangers and rogues, a slayer&#146;s abilities are all about getting into combat, dealing with a target, and then getting back out again.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any evil.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Ranger and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Slayer's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A slayer is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, as well as with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Bloodstained Hands (Ex): </b>A Sczarni executioner must be evil. If he ever becomes nonevil, he loses this archetype and becomes a regular slayer.</p>
			<p><b>Focused Killer (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a Sczarni executioner&#146;s studied target bonuses and the DCs of his slayer abilities increase by 1 against humanoid opponents, but decrease by 1 against non-humanoid targets. This ability alters studied target.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Target (Ex): </b>A slayer can study an opponent he can see as a move action. The slayer then gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks attempted against that opponent, and a +1 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against it. The DCs of slayer class abilities against that opponent increase by 1. A slayer can only maintain these bonuses against one opponent at a time; these bonuses remain in effect until either the opponent is dead or the slayer studies a new target.</p>
			<p>If a slayer deals sneak attack damage to a target, he can study that target as an immediate action, allowing him to apply his studied target bonuses against that target (including to the normal weapon damage roll).</p>
			<p>At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the bonuses on weapon attack, damage rolls, and skill checks and to slayer DCs against a studied target increase by 1. In addition, at each such interval, the slayer is able to maintain these bonuses against an additional studied target at the same time. The slayer may discard this connection to a studied target as a free action, allowing him to study another target in its place.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a slayer can study an opponent as a move or swift action.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A slayer adds 1/2 his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer Talents: </b>As a slayer gains experience, he learns a number of talents that aid him and confound his foes. Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer gains one slayer talent. Unless otherwise noted, a slayer cannot select an individual talent more than once. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a slayer&#146;s sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision of which to use must be made before the attack roll is made.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>At 3rd level, if a slayer catches an opponent unable to defend itself effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot for extra damage. The slayer&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime his target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the slayer flanks his target. This additional damage is 1d6 at 3rd level, and increases by 1d6 every 3 levels thereafter. Should the slayer score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this additional damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or unarmed strike), a slayer can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. He cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The slayer must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A slayer cannot use sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Painful Strike* (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a Sczarni executioner automatically gains this talent. Sczarni executioners are trained to cause excruciating pain when striking targets, often leaving them reeling in agony or completely incapacitated as they slowly bleed out. A creature that takes sneak attack damage from a Sczarni executioner must make a successful a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the Sczarni executioner&#146;s class level + his Intelligence modifier) or become sickened for 1d4 rounds. This ability alters the slayer talent received at 4th level and replaces swift tracker.</p>
			<p><b>Stalker (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a slayer gains his studied target bonus on Disguise, Intimidate, and Stealth checks against his studied opponent.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer can select one of the following advanced talents in place of a slayer talent.</p>
			<p><b>Assassinate (Ex): </b>At 10th level, a Sczarni executioner must select the assassinate advanced slayer talent.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer&#146;s Advance (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a slayer can once per day move up to twice his base speed as a move action. He may use Stealth as part of this movement, but takes a &#150;10 penalty to his check for doing so. At 17th level, he can do this twice per day.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Death (Ex): </b>At 14th level, once per day a Sczarni executioner can attempt to assassinate a foe without studying his foe beforehand. He must still succeed at a sneak attack against the target. At 19th level, he can make two such attacks per day. This ability replaces quarry and improved quarry.</p>
			<p><b>Master Slayer (Ex): </b>At 20th level, the slayer becomes a master at capturing or killing his studied targets. As a standard action, he can make a single attack against a studied target at his full attack bonus, choosing one of the following effects: kill, knock unconscious for 1d4 hours, or paralyze for 2d6 rounds. If the attack succeeds, the target takes damage normally and must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or suffer the additional effect. The DC for this save is 10 + 1/2 the slayer&#146;s level + the slayer&#146;s Intelligence modifier. Whether or not the target succeeds, it cannot be targeted by this ability again (by any slayer) for 24 hours.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>First known in Numeria, these aberration hunters have spread to other regions of Golarion, even as far as the lands bordering the Mana Wastes. In Numeria, Pureblades are skilled at slaying naturally arising aberrations and any creatures that have been mutated by exposure to the bizarre alien technology that pervades the land. Pureblades from Alkenstar and Nex lead forays into the magic-starved Mana Wastes to eliminate aberrations before the creatures can threaten their lands.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skilled at tracking down targets, slayers are consummate hunters, living for the chase and the deadly stroke that brings it to a close. Slayers spend most of their time honing their weapon skills, studying the habits and anatomy of foes, and practicing combat maneuvers.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The slayer is elusive, and good at finding the opportune time and location to strike. Combining the deadliest talents of rangers and rogues, a slayer&#146;s abilities are all about getting into combat, dealing with a target, and then getting back out again.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Ranger and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Slayer's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Disguise (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A slayer is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, as well as with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Aberration Hunter (Ex): </b>If a Pureblade deals damage to an aberration, as an immediate action he can apply his studied target bonus against that target even if he didn&#146;t sneak attack it. In addition, a Pureblade can attempt Knowledge (dungeoneering) skill checks untrained when trying to identify aberrations. This ability replaces track.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Target (Ex): </b>A slayer can study an opponent he can see as a move action. The slayer then gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks attempted against that opponent, and a +1 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against it. The DCs of slayer class abilities against that opponent increase by 1. A slayer can only maintain these bonuses against one opponent at a time; these bonuses remain in effect until either the opponent is dead or the slayer studies a new target.</p>
			<p>If a slayer deals sneak attack damage to a target, he can study that target as an immediate action, allowing him to apply his studied target bonuses against that target (including to the normal weapon damage roll).</p>
			<p>At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the bonuses on weapon attack, damage rolls, and skill checks and to slayer DCs against a studied target increase by 1. In addition, at each such interval, the slayer is able to maintain these bonuses against an additional studied target at the same time. The slayer may discard this connection to a studied target as a free action, allowing him to study another target in its place.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a slayer can study an opponent as a move or swift action.</p>
			<p><b>Alien Prescience (Sp): </b>At 2nd level, as a standard action a Pureblade can detect aberrations. This works like detect undead, except it detects aberrations instead of undead. This ability replaces the slayer talent received at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>At 3rd level, if a slayer catches an opponent unable to defend itself effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot for extra damage. The slayer&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime his target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the slayer flanks his target. This additional damage is 1d6 at 3rd level, and increases by 1d6 every 3 levels thereafter. Should the slayer score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this additional damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or unarmed strike), a slayer can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. He cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The slayer must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A slayer cannot use sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer Talents: </b>As a slayer gains experience, he learns a number of talents that aid him and confound his foes. Starting at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter (execpt 8th), a slayer gains one slayer talent. Unless otherwise noted, a slayer cannot select an individual talent more than once. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a slayer&#146;s sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision of which to use must be made before the attack roll is made.</p>
			<p><b>Discern Weakness (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a Pureblade becomes an expert at locating an aberration&#146;s weak points. The Pureblade rolls twice to confirm critical hits against aberrations and keeps the higher roll. This ability replaces stalker.</p>
			<p><b>Steely Mind (Ex): </b>At 8th level, a Pureblade gains a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting spells and effects. This bonus increases to +4 at 12th level and +6 at 16th level. In addition, once per day as a standard action, a Pureblade can shed a magical effect placed on him by an aberration as break enchantment, using his slayer level as his caster level. A Pureblade can use this ability twice per day at 12th level and three times per day at 16th level. This ability replaces the slayer talent received at 8th level.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer can select one of the following advanced talents in place of a slayer talent.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a slayer can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. When moving at up to twice his normal speed while tracking, he takes only a &#150;10 penalty instead of the normal &#150;20.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer&#146;s Advance (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a slayer can once per day move up to twice his base speed as a move action. He may use Stealth as part of this movement, but takes a &#150;10 penalty to his check for doing so. At 17th level, he can do this twice per day.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a slayer can as a standard action denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a slayer can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he gains a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats against his quarry are automatically conf irmed. A slayer can have no more than one quarry at a time, and the target must be selected as a studied target. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry target for 24 hours. If the slayer sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry target after 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the slayer&#146;s ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Aberration Slayer (Ex): </b>At 20th level, a Pureblade can use his master slayer ability on any aberration, even if it&#146;s not his studied target. This ability alters master slayer.</p>
			<p><b>Master Slayer (Ex): </b>At 20th level, the slayer becomes a master at capturing or killing his studied targets. As a standard action, he can make a single attack against a studied target at his full attack bonus, choosing one of the following effects: kill, knock unconscious for 1d4 hours, or paralyze for 2d6 rounds. If the attack succeeds, the target takes damage normally and must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or suffer the additional effect. The DC for this save is 10 + 1/2 the slayer&#146;s level + the slayer&#146;s Intelligence modifier. Whether or not the target succeeds, it cannot be targeted by this ability again (by any slayer) for 24 hours.</p>

					<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or unarmed strike), a slayer can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. He cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
					<p>The slayer must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A slayer cannot use sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A slayer is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, as well as with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Strike First, Strike Last (Ex): </b>A guerrilla adds half his level on Stealth checks when remaining motionless and reduces the penalty on Stealth checks when sniping by an equal amount. He also gains this bonus on his initiative checks in surprise rounds whenever he is aware of the surprise round and at least one enemy is unaware.</p>
			<p>This replaces track and swift tracker.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Target (Ex): </b>A slayer can study an opponent he can see as a move action. The slayer then gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks attempted against that opponent, and a +1 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against it. The DCs of slayer class abilities against that opponent increase by 1. A slayer can only maintain these bonuses against one opponent at a time; these bonuses remain in effect until either the opponent is dead or the slayer studies a new target.</p>
			<p>If a slayer deals sneak attack damage to a target, he can study that target as an immediate action, allowing him to apply his studied target bonuses against that target (including to the normal weapon damage roll).</p>
			<p>At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the bonuses on weapon attack, damage rolls, and skill checks and to slayer DCs against a studied target increase by 1. In addition, at each such interval, the slayer is able to maintain these bonuses against an additional studied target at the same time. The slayer may discard this connection to a studied target as a free action, allowing him to study another target in its place.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a slayer can study an opponent as a move or swift action.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer Talents: </b>As a slayer gains experience, he learns a number of talents that aid him and confound his foes. Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer gains one slayer talent. Unless otherwise noted, a slayer cannot select an individual talent more than once. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a slayer&#146;s sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision of which to use must be made before the attack roll is made.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>At 3rd level, if a slayer catches an opponent unable to defend itself effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot for extra damage. The slayer&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime his target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the slayer flanks his target. This additional damage is 1d6 at 3rd level, and increases by 1d6 every 3 levels thereafter. Should the slayer score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this additional damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or unarmed strike), a slayer can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. He cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The slayer must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A slayer cannot use sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Quick Start (Ex): </b>At 6th level, the guerrilla can take a normal charge action during the surprise round, rather than a charge with half the usual distance.</p>
			<p>This replaces the 6th-level slayer talent.</p>
			<p><b>Stalker (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a slayer gains his studied target bonus on Disguise, Intimidate, and Stealth checks against his studied opponent.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer can select one of the following advanced talents in place of a slayer talent.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer&#146;s Advance (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a slayer can once per day move up to twice his base speed as a move action. He may use Stealth as part of this movement, but takes a &#150;10 penalty to his check for doing so. At 17th level, he can do this twice per day.</p>
			<p><b>Astonishing Strike (Ex): </b>At 14th level, when the guerrilla deals sneak attack damage to a target of his studied target ability during the surprise round, that target is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC against attacks from the same guerrilla until the end of the guerrilla&#146;s next turn. When the guerrilla reaches 19th level, this ability works any time he deals sneak attack damage to a target of his studied target ability during the first round of combat, whether or not it&#146;s a surprise round.</p>
			<p>This replaces quarry and improved quarry.</p>
			<p><b>Master Slayer (Ex): </b>At 20th level, the slayer becomes a master at capturing or killing his studied targets. As a standard action, he can make a single attack against a studied target at his full attack bonus, choosing one of the following effects: kill, knock unconscious for 1d4 hours, or paralyze for 2d6 rounds. If the attack succeeds, the target takes damage normally and must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or suffer the additional effect. The DC for this save is 10 + 1/2 the slayer&#146;s level + the slayer&#146;s Intelligence modifier. Whether or not the target succeeds, it cannot be targeted by this ability again (by any slayer) for 24 hours.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>While paladins and inquisitors use their connection with the divine to fight undead hordes and other horrors of the night, a grave warden relies on knowledge, skill with weapons, and tenacity to put an end to these night-born terrors.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skilled at tracking down targets, slayers are consummate hunters, living for the chase and the deadly stroke that brings it to a close. Slayers spend most of their time honing their weapon skills, studying the habits and anatomy of foes, and practicing combat maneuvers.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The slayer is elusive, and good at finding the opportune time and location to strike. Combining the deadliest talents of rangers and rogues, a slayer&#146;s abilities are all about getting into combat, dealing with a target, and then getting back out again.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Ranger and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Slayer's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Disguise (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A slayer is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, as well as with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Studied Target (Ex): </b>A slayer can study an opponent he can see as a move action. The slayer then gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks attempted against that opponent, and a +1 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against it. The DCs of slayer class abilities against that opponent increase by 1. A slayer can only maintain these bonuses against one opponent at a time; these bonuses remain in effect until either the opponent is dead or the slayer studies a new target.</p>
			<p>If a slayer deals sneak attack damage to a target, he can study that target as an immediate action, allowing him to apply his studied target bonuses against that target (including to the normal weapon damage roll).</p>
			<p>At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the bonuses on weapon attack, damage rolls, and skill checks and to slayer DCs against a studied target increase by 1. In addition, at each such interval, the slayer is able to maintain these bonuses against an additional studied target at the same time. The slayer may discard this connection to a studied target as a free action, allowing him to study another target in its place.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a slayer can study an opponent as a move or swift action.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A slayer adds 1/2 his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Holy Water Sprinkler (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a grave warden can draw a flask of holy water as if it were a weapon (and can thus the Quick Draw feat to draw flasks of holy water). As a swift action, he can open a flask of holy water and pour it onto a held or adjacent melee weapon. If the weapon successfully hits an undead creature before the end of the grave warden&#146;s next turn, the undead takes damage as if it took a direct hit from the holy water, in addition to the damage from the weapon, if any. This ability replaces the slayer talent gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>At 3rd level, if a slayer catches an opponent unable to defend itself effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot for extra damage. The slayer&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime his target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the slayer flanks his target. This additional damage is 1d6 at 3rd level, and increases by 1d6 every 3 levels thereafter. Should the slayer score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this additional damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or unarmed strike), a slayer can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. He cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The slayer must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A slayer cannot use sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer Talents: </b>As a slayer gains experience, he learns a number of talents that aid him and confound his foes. Starting at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter (execpt 10th), a slayer gains one slayer talent. Unless otherwise noted, a slayer cannot select an individual talent more than once. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a slayer&#146;s sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision of which to use must be made before the attack roll is made.</p>
			<p><b>Death Ward (Sp): </b>At 7th level, a grave warden learns to perform a short ritual that grants the benefits of death ward, using his slayer level as his caster level. Performing this ritual takes 1 minute and uses 4 flasks of holy water. The grave warden can protect only himself with this ability. This ability replaces stalker.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer can select one of the following advanced talents in place of a slayer talent.</p>
			<p><b>Dustbringer (Ex): </b>At 10th level, a grave warden can slay a studied undead opponent. This functions as the assassinate slayer talent, except it requires a successful Will saving throw instead of a successful Fortitude save, affects only undead, and destroys the target instead of killing it. If the target succeeds at its saving throw, it becomes immune to that grave warden&#146;s dustbringer ability for 24 hours. This ability replaces the advanced slayer talent gained at 10th level.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a slayer can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. When moving at up to twice his normal speed while tracking, he takes only a &#150;10 penalty instead of the normal &#150;20.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer&#146;s Advance (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a slayer can once per day move up to twice his base speed as a move action. He may use Stealth as part of this movement, but takes a &#150;10 penalty to his check for doing so. At 17th level, he can do this twice per day.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a slayer can as a standard action denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a slayer can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty.

He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Slayer (Ex): </b>At 20th level, the slayer becomes a master at capturing or killing his studied targets.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Most slayers focus their efforts on single targets, but family hunters try to root out every branch of a tainted tree of life.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skilled at tracking down targets, slayers are consummate hunters, living for the chase and the deadly stroke that brings it to a close. Slayers spend most of their time honing their weapon skills, studying the habits and anatomy of foes, and practicing combat maneuvers.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The slayer is elusive, and good at finding the opportune time and location to strike. Combining the deadliest talents of rangers and rogues, a slayer&#146;s abilities are all about getting into combat, dealing with a target, and then getting back out again.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Ranger and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Slayer's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Disguise (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A slayer is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, as well as with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Studied Target (Ex): </b>A slayer can study an opponent he can see as a move action. The slayer then gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks attempted against that opponent, and a +1 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against it. The DCs of slayer class abilities against that opponent increase by 1. A slayer can only maintain these bonuses against one opponent at a time; these bonuses remain in effect until either the opponent is dead or the slayer studies a new target.</p>
			<p>If a slayer deals sneak attack damage to a target, he can study that target as an immediate action, allowing him to apply his studied target bonuses against that target (including to the normal weapon damage roll).</p>
			<p>At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the bonuses on weapon attack, damage rolls, and skill checks and to slayer DCs against a studied target increase by 1. In addition, at each such interval, the slayer is able to maintain these bonuses against an additional studied target at the same time. The slayer may discard this connection to a studied target as a free action, allowing him to study another target in its place.</p>
			<p>At 5th level and above, a slayer can maintain more than one studied target at a time only if all targets are closely related to one another (even if they aren&#146;t part of the family line she seeks to cleanse). This includes blood relatives; undead spawn; constructs or undead and their creator; summoned creatures and their summoner; creatures that are charmed, dominated, or otherwise under direct magical control and their controller; and cohorts, followers, animal companions, familiars, and similar associates of one master.</p>
			<p>This ability alters studied target.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a slayer can study an opponent as a move or swift action.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A slayer adds 1/2 his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Find Family (Sp): </b>At 2nd level, a family hunter chooses a particular family line of mortal creatures to cleanse (she must choose an actual family line like &#147;The Montrose family,&#148; rather than something generic that would cover all creatures of a given kind like &#147;All humans descended from the first human created by the gods&#148;). She can target any creature from that family line with discern next of kinACG (with a caster level equal to her slayer level) at will as a spell-like ability. The save DC is Charisma-based and is modified by the slayer&#146;s studied target bonus if the creature is also her studied target. A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to this ability for 24 hours. If the family hunter&#146;s chosen family line is completely eradicated, she can choose a new one after 1 month of studying.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the slayer talent gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Kinslayer (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a family hunter&#146;s sneak attack deals an additional 1d6 points of damage to any creature with a blood relation to the family line she seeks to cleanse.</p>
			<p>This ability alters sneak attack.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>At 3rd level, if a slayer catches an opponent unable to defend itself effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot for extra damage. The slayer&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime his target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the slayer flanks his target. This additional damage is 1d6 at 3rd level, and increases by 1d6 every 3 levels thereafter. Should the slayer score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this additional damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or unarmed strike), a slayer can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. He cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The slayer must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A slayer cannot use sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer Talents: </b>As a slayer gains experience, he learns a number of talents that aid him and confound his foes. Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer gains one slayer talent. Unless otherwise noted, a slayer cannot select an individual talent more than once. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a slayer&#146;s sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision of which to use must be made before the attack roll is made.</p>
			<p><b>Disrupt Teamwork (Ex): </b>At 6th level, a family hunter&#146;s studied target never counts as an ally to its allies for the purpose of flanking the family hunter or using teamwork feats or the aid another action against the family hunter.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the slayer talent gained at 6th level.</p>
			<p><b>Stalker (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a slayer gains his studied target bonus on Disguise, Intimidate, and Stealth checks against his studied opponent.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer can select one of the following advanced talents in place of a slayer talent.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a slayer can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. When moving at up to twice his normal speed while tracking, he takes only a &#150;10 penalty instead of the normal &#150;20.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer&#146;s Advance (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a slayer can once per day move up to twice his base speed as a move action. He may use Stealth as part of this movement, but takes a &#150;10 penalty to his check for doing so. At 17th level, he can do this twice per day.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a slayer can as a standard action denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a slayer can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he gains a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats against his quarry are automatically conf irmed. A slayer can have no more than one quarry at a time, and the target must be selected as a studied target. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry target for 24 hours. If the slayer sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry target after 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the slayer&#146;s ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Slayer (Ex): </b>At 20th level, the slayer becomes a master at capturing or killing his studied targets. As a standard action, he can make a single attack against a studied target at his full attack bonus, choosing one of the following effects: kill, knock unconscious for 1d4 hours, or paralyze for 2d6 rounds. If the attack succeeds, the target takes damage normally and must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or suffer the additional effect. The DC for this save is 10 + 1/2 the slayer&#146;s level + the slayer&#146;s Intelligence modifier. Whether or not the target succeeds, it cannot be targeted by this ability again (by any slayer) for 24 hours.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Mounted harriers, saboteurs, and skirmishers, dune riders can disrupt even the most organized opposition.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skilled at tracking down targets, slayers are consummate hunters, living for the chase and the deadly stroke that brings it to a close. Slayers spend most of their time honing their weapon skills, studying the habits and anatomy of foes, and practicing combat maneuvers.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The slayer is elusive, and good at finding the opportune time and location to strike. Combining the deadliest talents of rangers and rogues, a slayer&#146;s abilities are all about getting into combat, dealing with a target, and then getting back out again.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Ranger and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A slayer is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, as well as with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Desert Skirmisher (Ex): </b>The dune rider excels in combat in warm deserts, hills, and mountains. While in such terrain, he gains a +2 bonus on initiative, Perception, and Stealth checks, and a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, the bonus on initiative, Perception, and Stealth checks increases by 2 (maximum +10) and the bonus on attack and damage rolls increases by 1 (maximum +5).</p>
			<p>This replaces studied target.</p>
			<p><b>Sand Foot (Ex): </b>The dune rider adds half his level as a bonus on Ride checks in warm deserts, hills, and mountains. At 11th level, the dune rider and his mount no longer treat sand or rocky ground as difficult terrain, and they gain a +10-foot enhancement bonus to their base speed in warm deserts, hills, and mountains.</p>
			<p>This replaces track and fast tracker.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer Talents: </b>As a slayer gains experience, he learns a number of talents that aid him and confound his foes. Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer gains one slayer talent. Unless otherwise noted, a slayer cannot select an individual talent more than once. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a slayer&#146;s sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision of which to use must be made before the attack roll is made.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>At 3rd level, if a slayer catches an opponent unable to defend itself effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot for extra damage. The slayer&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime his target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the slayer flanks his target. This additional damage is 1d6 at 3rd level, and increases by 1d6 every 3 levels thereafter. Should the slayer score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this additional damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or unarmed strike), a slayer can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. He cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The slayer must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A slayer cannot use sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Galloping Fire (Ex): </b>At 4th level, the penalties for the dune rider&#146;s ranged attacks while mounted decrease by 2. These penalties decrease by an additional 2 at 7th level.</p>
			<p>This replaces stalker and the slayer talent normally gained at 4th level.</p>
			<p><b>Dust Vision (Ex): </b>At 8th level, the dune rider is at home in the desert. He exists comfortably in hot conditions up to 140&#186; Fahrenheit without having to attempt Fortitude saves. His equipment is likewise protected. He takes no penalties on Perception checks from blowing sand, dust, or heat shimmers, nor do these effects grant concealment to the dune rider&#146;s enemies within 30 feet. Effects that would grant total concealment work normally.</p>
			<p>This replaces the slayer talent normally gained at 8th level.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer can select one of the following advanced talents in place of a slayer talent.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer&#146;s Advance (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a slayer can once per day move up to twice his base speed as a move action. He may use Stealth as part of this movement, but takes a &#150;10 penalty to his check for doing so. At 17th level, he can do this twice per day.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a slayer can as a standard action denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a slayer can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he gains a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats against his quarry are automatically conf irmed. A slayer can have no more than one quarry at a time, and the target must be selected as a studied target. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry target for 24 hours. If the slayer sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry target after 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the slayer&#146;s ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Dunes of Death (Su): </b>At 20th level, a dune rider can use the desert&#146;s heat to finish off his foes. As a standard action, he can make a single attack at his full base attack bonus while in warm desert, hills, or mountains, choosing one of the following effects: kill, knock unconscious for 1d4 hours, or paralyze for 2d6 rounds. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must succeed at a Fortitude save or suffer the additional effect. The DC of this save is 20 + the dune rider&#146;s Intelligence modifier. Whether or not the target succeeds, it can&#146;t be targeted by this ability again for 24 hours.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Also known as a divine assassin, god&#146;s blade, or wrath-bringer, a deliverer is a weapon chosen by a god to punish those who have committed an affront to that deity. Evil deities are more likely to use assassins than deliverers, but some good deities use deliverers to deal with problems of a subtler nature than a cleric, inquisitor, paladin, or warpriest can typically handle.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skilled at tracking down targets, slayers are consummate hunters, living for the chase and the deadly stroke that brings it to a close. Slayers spend most of their time honing their weapon skills, studying the habits and anatomy of foes, and practicing combat maneuvers.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The slayer is elusive, and good at finding the opportune time and location to strike. Combining the deadliest talents of rangers and rogues, a slayer&#146;s abilities are all about getting into combat, dealing with a target, and then getting back out again.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Ranger and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Slayer's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Disguise (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A slayer is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, as well as with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A deliverer gains proficiency with his deity&#146;s favored weapon, in addition to the slayer&#146;s normal weapon proficiencies. This ability alters the slayer&#146;s weapon and armor proficiency.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Target (Ex): </b>A slayer can study an opponent he can see as a move action. The slayer then gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks attempted against that opponent, and a +1 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against it. The DCs of slayer class abilities against that opponent increase by 1. A slayer can only maintain these bonuses against one opponent at a time; these bonuses remain in effect until either the opponent is dead or the slayer studies a new target.</p>
			<p>If a slayer deals sneak attack damage to a target, he can study that target as an immediate action, allowing him to apply his studied target bonuses against that target (including to the normal weapon damage roll).</p>
			<p>At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the bonuses on weapon attack, damage rolls, and skill checks and to slayer DCs against a studied target increase by 1. In addition, at each such interval, the slayer is able to maintain these bonuses against an additional studied target at the same time. The slayer may discard this connection to a studied target as a free action, allowing him to study another target in its place.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a slayer can study an opponent as a move or swift action.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A slayer adds 1/2 his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Determined Zeal (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a deliverer shrugs off attempts by his moral opposite to control or kill him. On any round in which deliverer attacks an opponent whose alignment is at least two steps away from his own (such as a lawful good deliverer fighting a chaotic good or lawful evil foe, or a neutral foe with no other alignment components), he gains a +2 bonus on Will saving throws against that opponent&#146;s abilities, as well as the benefit of the Diehard feat until the end of his next turn. This ability replaces the slayer talent gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>At 3rd level, if a slayer catches an opponent unable to defend itself effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot for extra damage. The slayer&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime his target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the slayer flanks his target. This additional damage is 1d6 at 3rd level, and increases by 1d6 every 3 levels thereafter. Should the slayer score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this additional damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or unarmed strike), a slayer can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. He cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The slayer must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A slayer cannot use sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer Talents: </b>As a slayer gains experience, he learns a number of talents that aid him and confound his foes. Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer gains one slayer talent. Unless otherwise noted, a slayer cannot select an individual talent more than once. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a slayer&#146;s sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision of which to use must be made before the attack roll is made.</p>
			<p><b>True Believer (Ex): </b>At 6th level, mortal wounds cannot stop a deliverer from performing his divine duty. On any round in which he attacks an opponent whose alignment is at least two steps away from his own (see Determined Zeal, above) while benefiting from the Diehard feat, he isn&#146;t staggered from having negative hit points, nor does he automatically lose 1 hit point per round. This ability replaces the slayer talent gained at 6th level.</p>
			<p><b>Stalker (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a slayer gains his studied target bonus on Disguise, Intimidate, and Stealth checks against his studied opponent.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer can select one of the following advanced talents in place of a slayer talent.</p>
			<p><b>Divine Anathema (Ex): </b>At 10th level, as a free action a deliverer can declare a studied target to be his divine anathema. The studied target&#146;s alignment must be at least two steps away from that of the deliverer. Against this target, the deliverer&#146;s attacks deal an additional 2d6 points of damage; this damage is directly from divine power and does not stack with the bonus damage from a holy or unholy weapon, or a weapon with a similar weapon special ability or effect. A deliverer can have only one divine anathema at a time. This ability replaces the advanced slayer talent gained at 10th level.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a slayer can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. When moving at up to twice his normal speed while tracking, he takes only a &#150;10 penalty instead of the normal &#150;20.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer&#146;s Advance (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a slayer can once per day move up to twice his base speed as a move action. He may use Stealth as part of this movement, but takes a &#150;10 penalty to his check for doing so. At 17th level, he can do this twice per day.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a slayer can as a standard action denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a slayer can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he gains a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats against his quarry are automatically conf irmed. A slayer can have no more than one quarry at a time, and the target must be selected as a studied target. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry target for 24 hours. If the slayer sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry target after 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the slayer&#146;s ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Slayer (Ex): </b>At 20th level, the slayer becomes a master at capturing or killing his studied targets. As a standard action, he can make a single attack against a studied target at his full attack bonus, choosing one of the following effects: kill, knock unconscious for 1d4 hours, or paralyze for 2d6 rounds. If the attack succeeds, the target takes damage normally and must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or suffer the additional effect. The DC for this save is 10 + 1/2 the slayer&#146;s level + the slayer&#146;s Intelligence modifier. Whether or not the target succeeds, it cannot be targeted by this ability again (by any slayer) for 24 hours.</p>
			<h>Ex-Deliverers</h>
			<p>A deliverer who grossly violates the code of conduct required by his deity loses all class features granted by this archetype, except for the weapon proficiencies. (He does not gain the slayer class abilities that the archetype replaces.) He cannot thereafter gain levels as a deliverer of that deity until he atones for his deeds (see the atonement spell description).</p>

					<p>A covenbane&#146;s magical scars throb in the presence of magic. A covenbane adds half his level (minimum +1) on Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks to identify, recognize, or track a hag, arcane spellcaster, or creature with spell-like abilities. He can also use his hag sense to recognize whether someone within 30 feet of him is using magic to hide her true form. To do this, he must succeed at a Perception check against a DC equal to 15 + the target&#146;s CR; success indicates the presence of a magical disguise, but it does not reveal the creature&#146;s true form.</p>

					<p>At 2nd level, a covenbane can designate an entire coven as his studied target by studying any single member. He applies his studied target bonus against all members of the studied creature&#146;s coven, and all members of the coven count as one target for the purposes of determining the maximum number of studied targets a slayer can maintain. This bonus remains even if one or more members of the coven die after the covenbane studies them. Beginning at 7th level, the covenbane can designate other magically linked creatures, such as those bound by a hivemind or a telepathic bond spell, as a coven, but he can target only three members of such a link. Studying a coven always requires a move action, even if the slayer could normally study a target with a swift or immediate action.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Covenbane slayers are scarred by arcane magic at a young age, and that resonance gives them supernatural insight into the psychic bonds between others. They are adept at fighting tight-knit groups, exploiting their connections to hunt and wound teams. The churches of Iomedae and Milani in particular dispatch special agents to rescue hexed children from Irrisen, Razmiran, and other lands plagued by abusive arcanists and then raise them in this deadly art.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skilled at tracking down targets, slayers are consummate hunters, living for the chase and the deadly stroke that brings it to a close. Slayers spend most of their time honing their weapon skills, studying the habits and anatomy of foes, and practicing combat maneuvers.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The slayer is elusive, and good at finding the opportune time and location to strike. Combining the deadliest talents of rangers and rogues, a slayer&#146;s abilities are all about getting into combat, dealing with a target, and then getting back out again.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Ranger and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Slayer's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Disguise (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A slayer is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, as well as with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Hag Sense (Su): </b>A covenbane&#146;s magical scars throb in the presence of magic. A covenbane adds half his level (minimum +1) on Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks to identify, recognize, or track a hag, arcane spellcaster, or creature with spell-like abilities. He can also use his hag sense to recognize whether someone within 30 feet of him is using magic to hide her true form. To do this, he must succeed at a Perception check against a DC equal to 15 + the target&#146;s CR; success indicates the presence of a magical disguise, but it does not reveal the creature&#146;s true form.</p>
			<p>This replaces track.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Target (Ex): </b>A slayer can study an opponent he can see as a move action. The slayer then gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks attempted against that opponent, and a +1 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against it. The DCs of slayer class abilities against that opponent increase by 1. A slayer can only maintain these bonuses against one opponent at a time; these bonuses remain in effect until either the opponent is dead or the slayer studies a new target.</p>
			<p>If a slayer deals sneak attack damage to a target, he can study that target as an immediate action, allowing him to apply his studied target bonuses against that target (including to the normal weapon damage roll).</p>
			<p>At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the bonuses on weapon attack, damage rolls, and skill checks and to slayer DCs against a studied target increase by 1. In addition, at each such interval, the slayer is able to maintain these bonuses against an additional studied target at the same time. The slayer may discard this connection to a studied target as a free action, allowing him to study another target in its place.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a slayer can study an opponent as a move or swift action.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Coven (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a covenbane can designate an entire coven as his studied target by studying any single member. He applies his studied target bonus against all members of the studied creature&#146;s coven, and all members of the coven count as one target for the purposes of determining the maximum number of studied targets a slayer can maintain. This bonus remains even if one or more members of the coven die after the covenbane studies them. Beginning at 7th level, the covenbane can designate other magically linked creatures, such as those bound by a hivemind or a telepathic bond spell, as a coven, but he can target only three members of such a link. Studying a coven always requires a move action, even if the slayer could normally study a target with a swift or immediate action.</p>
			<p>This replaces the slayer talent gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>At 3rd level, if a slayer catches an opponent unable to defend itself effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot for extra damage. The slayer&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime his target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the slayer flanks his target. This additional damage is 1d6 at 3rd level, and increases by 1d6 every 3 levels thereafter. Should the slayer score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this additional damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or unarmed strike), a slayer can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. He cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The slayer must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A slayer cannot use sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer Talents: </b>As a slayer gains experience, he learns a number of talents that aid him and confound his foes. Starting at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer gains one slayer talent. Unless otherwise noted, a slayer cannot select an individual talent more than once. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a slayer&#146;s sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision of which to use must be made before the attack roll is made.</p>
			<p><b>Disrupt Coven (Su): </b>Anyone the slayer threatens no longer counts as an ally for the purposes of friendly spellcasting or employing teamwork feats and cannot access any special abilities gained from being part of a coven (including coven spellcasting).</p>
			<p>This replaces stalker.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer can select one of the following advanced talents in place of a slayer talent.</p>
			<p><b>Unseen Sense (Su): </b>At 11th level, the covenbane learns to use his hag sense to help target concealed or invisible opponents in combat. He can use his hag sense to detect invisible opponents as well as magically disguised creatures. He also gains Blind-Fight as a bonus feat but gains its benefits only against spellcasters and creatures with spell-like abilities.</p>
			<p>This replaces swift tracker.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer&#146;s Advance (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a slayer can once per day move up to twice his base speed as a move action. He may use Stealth as part of this movement, but takes a &#150;10 penalty to his check for doing so. At 17th level, he can do this twice per day.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a slayer can as a standard action denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a slayer can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he gains a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats against his quarry are automatically conf irmed. A slayer can have no more than one quarry at a time, and the target must be selected as a studied target. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry target for 24 hours. If the slayer sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry target after 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the slayer&#146;s ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Slayer (Ex): </b>At 20th level, the slayer becomes a master at capturing or killing his studied targets. As a standard action, he can make a single attack against a studied target at his full attack bonus, choosing one of the following effects: kill, knock unconscious for 1d4 hours, or paralyze for 2d6 rounds. If the attack succeeds, the target takes damage normally and must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or suffer the additional effect. The DC for this save is 10 + 1/2 the slayer&#146;s level + the slayer&#146;s Intelligence modifier. Whether or not the target succeeds, it cannot be targeted by this ability again (by any slayer) for 24 hours.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, a cleaner is able to study a location, conceal evidence, and hide in or extricate himself quickly from that location. Studying a location takes 1 minute for each 10-foot square. Once he has studied an area, the cleaner can attempt a Disguise check to alter evidence or a Stealth check to conceal evidence (by doing things such as cleaning up bloodstains, obscuring footprints, moving a dead body, and so on). Altering an area takes 1d3 10 minutes of work per 10-foot square. Anyone attempting to determine what actually happened in that area must succeed at an opposed Perception check against the result of the cleaner&#146;s Disguise or Stealth check (cleaner&#146;s choice) or accept the altered scene as truth. The cleaner gains a +4 bonus on this check, on Sleight of Hand checks to hide objects from that location on his person, and on Stealth checks to hide within or escape from that location. This lasts as long as the scene remains unaltered (except by the cleaner). This ability replaces the slayer talent gained at 4th level.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level, if a slayer catches an opponent unable to defend itself effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot for extra damage.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A cleaner is responsible for destroying or removing incriminating evidence from a crime scene, disposing of corpses and eliminating witnesses to make a crime look like an accident or a mere disappearance.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skilled at tracking down targets, slayers are consummate hunters, living for the chase and the deadly stroke that brings it to a close. Slayers spend most of their time honing their weapon skills, studying the habits and anatomy of foes, and practicing combat maneuvers.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The slayer is elusive, and good at finding the opportune time and location to strike. Combining the deadliest talents of rangers and rogues, a slayer&#146;s abilities are all about getting into combat, dealing with a target, and then getting back out again.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Ranger and rogue.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A slayer is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, as well as with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Deceitful: </b>At 1st level, a cleaner becomes skilled at deceiving others, and gains Deceitful as a bonus feat. This ability replaces track.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Target (Ex): </b>A slayer can study an opponent he can see as a move action. The slayer then gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks attempted against that opponent, and a +1 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against it. The DCs of slayer class abilities against that opponent increase by 1. A slayer can only maintain these bonuses against one opponent at a time; these bonuses remain in effect until either the opponent is dead or the slayer studies a new target.</p>
			<p>If a slayer deals sneak attack damage to a target, he can study that target as an immediate action, allowing him to apply his studied target bonuses against that target (including to the normal weapon damage roll).</p>
			<p>At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the bonuses on weapon attack, damage rolls, and skill checks and to slayer DCs against a studied target increase by 1. In addition, at each such interval, the slayer is able to maintain these bonuses against an additional studied target at the same time. The slayer may discard this connection to a studied target as a free action, allowing him to study another target in its place.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a slayer can study an opponent as a move or swift action.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer Talents: </b>As a slayer gains experience, he learns a number of talents that aid him and confound his foes. Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer gains one slayer talent. Unless otherwise noted, a slayer cannot select an individual talent more than once. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a slayer&#146;s sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision of which to use must be made before the attack roll is made.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>At 3rd level, if a slayer catches an opponent unable to defend itself effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot for extra damage. The slayer&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime his target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the slayer flanks his target. This additional damage is 1d6 at 3rd level, and increases by 1d6 every 3 levels thereafter. Should the slayer score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this additional damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or unarmed strike), a slayer can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. He cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The slayer must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A slayer cannot use sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Without a Trace (Ex): </b>At 4th level, a cleaner is able to study a location, conceal evidence, and hide in or extricate himself quickly from that location. Studying a location takes 1 minute for each 10-foot square. Once he has studied an area, the cleaner can attempt a Disguise check to alter evidence or a Stealth check to conceal evidence (by doing things such as cleaning up bloodstains, obscuring footprints, moving a dead body, and so on). Altering an area takes 1d3 10 minutes of work per 10-foot square. Anyone attempting to determine what actually happened in that area must succeed at an opposed Perception check against the result of the cleaner&#146;s Disguise or Stealth check (cleaner&#146;s choice) or accept the altered scene as truth. The cleaner gains a +4 bonus on this check, on Sleight of Hand checks to hide objects from that location on his person, and on Stealth checks to hide within or escape from that location. This lasts as long as the scene remains unaltered (except by the cleaner). This ability replaces the slayer talent gained at 4th level.</p>
			<p><b>Mislead (Sp): </b>At 7th level, a cleaner can cast misdirection on himself at will. This lasts until the cleaner uses the ability again or ends the effect as a standard action. This ability replaces stalker.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer can select one of the following advanced talents in place of a slayer talent.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a slayer can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. When moving at up to twice his normal speed while tracking, he takes only a &#150;10 penalty instead of the normal &#150;20.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer&#146;s Advance (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a slayer can once per day move up to twice his base speed as a move action. He may use Stealth as part of this movement, but takes a &#150;10 penalty to his check for doing so. At 17th level, he can do this twice per day.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a slayer can as a standard action denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a slayer can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he gains a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats against his quarry are automatically conf irmed. A slayer can have no more than one quarry at a time, and the target must be selected as a studied target.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Followers of a tradition dating back to the ancient empire of Yixing, the yellow-robed agents known as butterfly blades now operate primarily in Goka, where many serve the city&#146;s politically savvy ruler. Butterfly blades work in the shadows, eliminating threats with their namesake weapons and intimidating troublesome nobles.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skilled at tracking down targets, slayers are consummate hunters, living for the chase and the deadly stroke that brings it to a close. Slayers spend most of their time honing their weapon skills, studying the habits and anatomy of foes, and practicing combat maneuvers.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The slayer is elusive, and good at finding the opportune time and location to strike. Combining the deadliest talents of rangers and rogues, a slayer&#146;s abilities are all about getting into combat, dealing with a target, and then getting back out again.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Ranger and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Slayer's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Disguise (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A slayer is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, as well as with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Studied Stalker (Ex): </b>A butterfly blade gains the stalker class feature at 1st level, rather than at 7th level. The butterfly blade doesn&#146;t add his studied target bonus on Knowledge or Survival checks.</p>
			<p>This ability alters studied target and replaces track.</p>
			<p><b>Studied Target (Ex): </b>A slayer can study an opponent he can see as a move action. The slayer then gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks attempted against that opponent, and a +1 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against it. The DCs of slayer class abilities against that opponent increase by 1. A slayer can only maintain these bonuses against one opponent at a time; these bonuses remain in effect until either the opponent is dead or the slayer studies a new target.</p>
			<p>If a slayer deals sneak attack damage to a target, he can study that target as an immediate action, allowing him to apply his studied target bonuses against that target (including to the normal weapon damage roll).</p>
			<p>At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the bonuses on weapon attack, damage rolls, and skill checks and to slayer DCs against a studied target increase by 1. In addition, at each such interval, the slayer is able to maintain these bonuses against an additional studied target at the same time. The slayer may discard this connection to a studied target as a free action, allowing him to study another target in its place.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a slayer can study an opponent as a move or swift action.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Feats: </b>Whenever a butterfly blade would gain a slayer talent, he can instead select a feat from the following list: Cutting HumiliationUI, EnforcerAPG, Intimidating Prowess, Nerve-Racking NegotiatorUI, or Threatening NegotiatorUI. The butterfly blade does not need to meet the feat&#146;s prerequisites.</p>
			<p>This alters slayer talents.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer Talents: </b>As a slayer gains experience, he learns a number of talents that aid him and confound his foes. Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer gains one slayer talent. Unless otherwise noted, a slayer cannot select an individual talent more than once. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a slayer&#146;s sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision of which to use must be made before the attack roll is made.</p>
			<p><b>Butterfly&#146;s Kiss (Ex): </b>Butterfly blades train to inflict painful cuts rather than lethal ones.

The ability&#146;s caster level is equal to his slayer class level, and the DC is equal to 10 + the number of ranks the butterfly blade has in either Bluff or Intimidate, whichever is higher.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces stalker, swift tracker, and quarry.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer can select one of the following advanced talents in place of a slayer talent.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer&#146;s Advance (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a slayer can once per day move up to twice his base speed as a move action. He may use Stealth as part of this movement, but takes a &#150;10 penalty to his check for doing so. At 17th level, he can do this twice per day.</p>

			<p><b>Master Slayer (Ex): </b>At 20th level, the slayer becomes a master at capturing or killing his studied targets. As a standard action, he can make a single attack against a studied target at his full attack bonus, choosing one of the following effects: kill, knock unconscious for 1d4 hours, or paralyze for 2d6 rounds.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Whether tasked with bringing in wanted criminals or paid to drag debtors back to their loan sharks, bounty hunters are valued for their ability to capture targets alive.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>

			<p><b>Role: </b>The slayer is elusive, and good at finding the opportune time and location to strike. Combining the deadliest talents of rangers and rogues, a slayer&#146;s abilities are all about getting into combat, dealing with a target, and then getting back out again.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Ranger and rogue.</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A bounty hunter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons plus the aklys, bolas, dan bong, lasso, and net.

The slayer may discard this connection to a studied target as a free action, allowing him to study another target in its place.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a slayer can study an opponent as a move or swift action.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A slayer adds 1/2 his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow tracks.</p>

This combat maneuver does not provoke attacks of opportunity. This ability replaces the slayer talent gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>At 3rd level, if a slayer catches an opponent unable to defend itself effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot for extra damage. The slayer&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime his target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the slayer flanks his target. This additional damage is 1d6 at 3rd level, and increases by 1d6 every 3 levels thereafter. Should the slayer score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this additional damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or unarmed strike), a slayer can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. He cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The slayer must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A slayer cannot use sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer Talents: </b>As a slayer gains experience, he learns a number of talents that aid him and confound his foes. Starting at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter (execpt 6th and 10th), a slayer gains one slayer talent. Unless otherwise noted, a slayer cannot select an individual talent more than once. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a slayer&#146;s sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision of which to use must be made before the attack roll is made.</p>
			<p><b>Submission Hold (Ex): </b>At 6th level, when a bounty hunter attempts a grapple combat maneuver check to deal damage, he can choose to add his sneak attack damage to the grapple damage for that attack. He takes a &#150;5 penalty on the combat maneuver check if he does this. This sneak attack damage is nonlethal damage, unless the bounty hunter is able to deal normal damage with a grapple and chooses to do so. This ability replaces the slayer talent gained at 6th level.</p>
			<p><b>Stalker (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a slayer gains his studied target bonus on Disguise, Intimidate, and Stealth checks against his studied opponent.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer can select one of the following advanced talents in place of a slayer talent.</p>
			<p><b>Incapacitate (Ex): </b>At 10th level, a bounty hunter can incapacitate a studied target. This functions like the assassinate slayer talent, except instead of killing the target, the bounty hunter&#146;s successful attack knocks the target unconscious for 1d6 rounds unless it succeeds at its saving throw. If the target does succeed at its saving throw, it still takes the sneak attack damage as normal, but the damage is nonlethal, and the target is immune to that slayer&#146;s incapacitate ability for 24 hours. This ability replaces the advanced slayer talent gained at 10th level.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a slayer can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. When moving at up to twice his normal speed while tracking, he takes only a &#150;10 penalty instead of the normal &#150;20.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer&#146;s Advance (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a slayer can once per day move up to twice his base speed as a move action. He may use Stealth as part of this movement, but takes a &#150;10 penalty to his check for doing so. At 17th level, he can do this twice per day.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a slayer can as a standard action denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a slayer can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he gains a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats against his quarry are automatically conf irmed. A slayer can have no more than one quarry at a time, and the target must be selected as a studied target. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry target for 24 hours. If the slayer sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry target after 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the slayer&#146;s ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Slayer (Ex): </b>At 20th level, the slayer becomes a master at capturing or killing his studied targets. As a standard action, he can make a single attack against a studied target at his full attack bonus, choosing one of the following effects: kill, knock unconscious for 1d4 hours, or paralyze for 2d6 rounds. If the attack succeeds, the target takes damage normally and must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or suffer the additional effect. The DC for this save is 10 + 1/2 the slayer&#146;s level + the slayer&#146;s Intelligence modifier. Whether or not the target succeeds, it cannot be targeted by this ability again (by any slayer) for 24 hours.</p>

					<p><i>Distant Voices (Sp): </i>At 1st level, a bloody jake can cause his voice to seem to emanate from somewhere else, as per ventriloquism. This ability doesn&#146;t take any other action to activate and can be used as part of speaking (as a free action); it costs one use of cruel tricks to affect his speech for 1 round.</p>
					<p><i>Lose Your Way (Sp): </i>At 4th level, as a standard action, a bloody jake can spend one use of cruel tricks to cause a creature that is within 30 feet and within the bloody jake&#146;s favored terrain to become disoriented, taking a penalty on Survival checks equal to the bloody jake&#146;s slayer level and a &#150;2 penalty on saving throws against fear and illusions. This effect lasts for 1 hour per slayer level of the bloody jake or for as long as the affected creature remains within the bloody jake&#146;s favored terrain, whichever is shorter.</p>
					<p><i>Something&#146;s Not Right (Su): </i>At 8th level, as a move action, a bloody jake can spend one use of cruel tricks to cause all foes within 30 feet to become shaken for 1 round. This is a fear effect that doesn&#146;t increase in strength by applying other effects that cause creatures to become shaken. At 12th level, he can use this ability as a swift action. At 16th level, a bloody jake can make any number of the affected foes frightened for 1 round, though such foes receive a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the loody jake&#146;s slayer level + his Charisma modifier) to negate the frightened condition; even so, such a foe is still shaken.</p>
					<p><i>The Woods Have Eyes (Sp): </i>At 12th level, a bloody jake in his favored terrain can spend one use of cruel tricks as a swift action to gain blindsense in a 30-foot radius for 1 round; this blindsense is sound-based.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Bloody jakes are cruel backwoods folk who prey upon their country cousins while terrorizing civilized people who venture into their rural range.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skilled at tracking down targets, slayers are consummate hunters, living for the chase and the deadly stroke that brings it to a close. Slayers spend most of their time honing their weapon skills, studying the habits and anatomy of foes, and practicing combat maneuvers.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The slayer is elusive, and good at finding the opportune time and location to strike. Combining the deadliest talents of rangers and rogues, a slayer&#146;s abilities are all about getting into combat, dealing with a target, and then getting back out again.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>A bloody jake must be of an evil alignment. A bloody jake who becomes nonevil cannot gain new levels as a slayer but retains all his class abilities.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Ranger and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Slayer's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Disguise (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>6 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A bloody jake is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, as well as with light armor.</p>
			<p><b>Cruel Tricks: </b>Bloody jakes use backwoods folk magic to confuse, terrify, and weaken their prey. A bloody jake can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his slayer level + his Charisma modifier. He gains the cruel tricks below at the indicated slayer levels.</p>
			<p><i>Distant Voices (Sp): </i>At 1st level, a bloody jake can cause his voice to seem to emanate from somewhere else, as per ventriloquism. This ability doesn&#146;t take any other action to activate and can be used as part of speaking (as a free action); it costs one use of cruel tricks to affect his speech for 1 round.</p>
			<p><i>Lose Your Way (Sp): </i>At 4th level, as a standard action, a bloody jake can spend one use of cruel tricks to cause a creature that is within 30 feet and within the bloody jake&#146;s favored terrain to become disoriented, taking a penalty on Survival checks equal to the bloody jake&#146;s slayer level and a &#150;2 penalty on saving throws against fear and illusions. This effect lasts for 1 hour per slayer level of the bloody jake or for as long as the affected creature remains within the bloody jake&#146;s favored terrain, whichever is shorter.</p>
			<p><i>Something&#146;s Not Right (Su): </i>At 8th level, as a move action, a bloody jake can spend one use of cruel tricks to cause all foes within 30 feet to become shaken for 1 round. This is a fear effect that doesn&#146;t increase in strength by applying other effects that cause creatures to become shaken. At 12th level, he can use this ability as a swift action. At 16th level, a bloody jake can make any number of the affected foes frightened for 1 round, though such foes receive a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the loody jake&#146;s slayer level + his Charisma modifier) to negate the frightened condition; even so, such a foe is still shaken.</p>
			<p><i>The Woods Have Eyes (Sp): </i>At 12th level, a bloody jake in his favored terrain can spend one use of cruel tricks as a swift action to gain blindsense in a 30-foot radius for 1 round; this blindsense is sound-based.</p>
			<p>This replaces the 1st-level studied target and the slayer talents gained at 4th, 8th, 12th, and 16th level.</p>
			<p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a bloody jake can select a type of terrain from the favored terrain table for rangers (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 65), though he is restricted to cold, desert, forest, jungle, mountains, plains, and swamp. His bonuses when in this terrain increase by 2 at 5th level and every 5 slayer levels thereafter, though he does not gain the ability to select additional favored terrains unless he takes the terrain masteryUC rogue talent.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the slayer&#146;s proficiency in medium armor and shields.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A slayer adds 1/2 his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer Talents: </b>As a slayer gains experience, he learns a number of talents that aid him and confound his foes. Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer gains one slayer talent. Unless otherwise noted, a slayer cannot select an individual talent more than once. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a slayer&#146;s sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision of which to use must be made before the attack roll is made.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>At 3rd level, if a slayer catches an opponent unable to defend itself effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot for extra damage. The slayer&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime his target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the slayer flanks his target. This additional damage is 1d6 at 3rd level, and increases by 1d6 every 3 levels thereafter. Should the slayer score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this additional damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or unarmed strike), a slayer can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. He cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The slayer must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A slayer cannot use sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Poor Study (Ex): </b>A bloody jake gains this ability at 5th level rather than 1st level, beginning with a bonus of +1 at 5th level and increasing by 1 for every 5 slayer levels thereafter. A bloody jake must be 11th level to study an opponent as a move or swift action.</p>
			<p>This ability alters studied target.</p>
			<p><b>Sadistic Snare (Ex): </b>At 6th level, a bloody jake gains Learn Ranger TrapUM as a bonus feat, benefiting from it as if he were a ranger. He can expend two uses of his traps ability to add his sneak attack damage to the trap&#146;s damage; any slayer talents or rogue talents he has that modify sneak attack damage, such as bleeding attack, also apply to sneak attack damage dealt by his ranger traps.</p>
			<p>This replaces the slayer talent gained at 6th level.</p>
			<p><b>Stalker (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a slayer gains his studied target bonus on Disguise, Intimidate, and Stealth checks against his studied opponent.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer can select one of the following advanced talents in place of a slayer talent.</p>
			<p><b>Cruel Trick (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a bloody jake can maim or humiliate his target with a sneak attack, substituting 1 point of Dexterity or Charisma damage per die of sneak attack damage forfeited. A successful Will save negates this ability damage (DC = 10 + 1/2 the bloody jake&#146;s slayer level + his Charisma modifier).</p>
			<p>This ability replaces swift tracker.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Shortcut (Sp): </b>At 13th level, a bloody jake can move with supernatural ease among the trees once per day, as if using tree stride with a caster level equal to his slayer level.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces slayer&#146;s advance.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a slayer can as a standard action denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a slayer can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he gains a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats against his quarry are automatically conf irmed. A slayer can have no more than one quarry at a time, and the target must be selected as a studied target. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry target for 24 hours. If the slayer sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry target after 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the slayer&#146;s ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Master Slayer (Ex): </b>At 20th level, the slayer becomes a master at capturing or killing his studied targets. As a standard action, he can make a single attack against a studied target at his full attack bonus, choosing one of the following effects: kill, knock unconscious for 1d4 hours, or paralyze for 2d6 rounds. If the attack succeeds, the target takes damage normally and must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or suffer the additional effect. The DC for this save is 10 + 1/2 the slayer&#146;s level + the slayer&#146;s Intelligence modifier. Whether or not the target succeeds, it cannot be targeted by this ability again (by any slayer) for 24 hours.</p>

					<p>An avalancher adds half his level on Acrobatics checks to jump or soften a fall.

If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must succeed at a Fortitude save or suffer the additional effect. The save DC is equal to 20 + 1 for every 10 feet the avalancher fell before making the attack (to a maximum of DC 30 for a fall of 100 feet or more).

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Avalanchers attack from overhead cliffs and mesas like a landslide of arrows and blades.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skilled at tracking down targets, slayers are consummate hunters, living for the chase and the deadly stroke that brings it to a close. Slayers spend most of their time honing their weapon skills, studying the habits and anatomy of foes, and practicing combat maneuvers.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The slayer is elusive, and good at finding the opportune time and location to strike. Combining the deadliest talents of rangers and rogues, a slayer&#146;s abilities are all about getting into combat, dealing with a target, and then getting back out again.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Class(es): </b>Ranger and rogue.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A slayer is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, as well as with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Cliff Jumper (Ex): </b>An avalancher adds half his level on Acrobatics checks to jump or soften a fall. Whenever he attempts an Acrobatics check to soften an intentional fall, he reduces the falling damage he takes by an additional 1d6 for every increment of 10 by which his Acrobatics check result exceeds the DC (a 2d6 reduction at DC 25, 3d6 at DC 35, and so on). At 11th level, the avalancher reduces the DC of his Acrobatics checks to soften a fall by 5.</p>
			<p>This replaces track and swift tracker.</p>
			<p><b>Falling Strike (Ex): </b>An avalancher excels at dropping onto opponents from higher ground. He gains a +1 bonus on Stealth checks and attack and damage rolls when he falls at least 10 feet before attacking an opponent. These bonuses stack with any bonuses the avalancher receives for charging or attacking from higher ground.</p>
			<p>At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the bonuses from falling strike increase by 1.</p>
			<p>This replaces studied target.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer Talents: </b>As a slayer gains experience, he learns a number of talents that aid him and confound his foes. Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer gains one slayer talent. Unless otherwise noted, a slayer cannot select an individual talent more than once. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a slayer&#146;s sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision of which to use must be made before the attack roll is made.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>At 3rd level, if a slayer catches an opponent unable to defend itself effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot for extra damage. The slayer&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime his target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the slayer flanks his target. This additional damage is 1d6 at 3rd level, and increases by 1d6 every 3 levels thereafter. Should the slayer score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this additional damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or unarmed strike), a slayer can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. He cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The slayer must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A slayer cannot use sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Falling Dodge (Ex): </b>At 7th level, an avalancher gains his bonus to AC from the falling strike ability when a jump or fall carries him through threatened squares. This bonus applies only when he&#146;s jumping, not when he&#146;s using Acrobatics to try to avoid attacks of opportunity from moving through threatened squares.</p>
			<p>This replaces stalker.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer can select one of the following advanced talents in place of a slayer talent.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a slayer can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. When moving at up to twice his normal speed while tracking, he takes only a &#150;10 penalty instead of the normal &#150;20.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer&#146;s Advance (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a slayer can once per day move up to twice his base speed as a move action. He may use Stealth as part of this movement, but takes a &#150;10 penalty to his check for doing so. At 17th level, he can do this twice per day.</p>
			<p><b>Fall-By Attack (Ex): </b>At 14th level, if the avalancher makes a single jump of at least 20 feet in any direction and lands at an elevation at least 10 feet lower than his starting elevation, he can make ranged or melee attacks during his fall as if he were making a full-round attack. He can make any number of attacks in any combination of squares along this single jump, up to his maximum number of attacks, but he can attack a given creature once at most. If the avalancher attempts a jump but fails the Acrobatics check, he makes no attacks and suffers the consequences of his failed jump normally. At 19th level, he can add his extra damage from sneak attack against each creature he hits while using this ability, even if the targets have acted in combat or retain their Dexterity bonuses to AC.</p>
			<p>This replaces quarry and improved quarry.</p>
			<p><b>Death from Above (Ex): </b>At 20th level, an avalancher can take down his foe with a single attack. During a round, if he falls at least 10 feet (the action type depends on how he comes to be falling), he can make a single attack at his full base attack bonus as a standard action, choosing one of the following effects: kill, knock unconscious for 1d4 hours, or paralyze for 2d6 rounds. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must succeed at a Fortitude save or suffer the additional effect. The save DC is equal to 20 + 1 for every 10 feet the avalancher fell before making the attack (to a maximum of DC 30 for a fall of 100 feet or more). Whether or not the target succeeds, it can&#146;t be targeted by this ability again (by any avalancher) for 24 hours.</p>
			<p>This replaces master slayer.</p>

				<name type="string">Shadow Prey</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>An ankou&#146;s shadow cannot denote a target as his quarry unless he has a shadow double present, but unlike other slayers, the target does not need to be one of his studied targets.</p>

			<id-00003>
				<level type="number">1</level>
				<name type="string">Shadow Double</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>An ankou&#146;s shadow can take a full-round action to create a single, quasi-real, shadowy duplicate. This shadow double remains in his square, mimicking his movements as a single mirror image, except that it lasts until it is destroyed or he chooses to dismiss it as a swift action. This ability does not stack with the mirror image spell or with similar abilities, such as the copycat ability of the Trickery domain.</p>
					<p>At 5th level, an ankou&#146;s shadow gains a second shadow double. In addition to using these shadow doubles as mirror images in his square, he can move his doubles as part of his own move action, dividing his movement between himself and his doubles. When outside his square, shadow doubles do not protect the ankou&#146;s shadow as mirror image and are limited in the actions they can take. Shadow doubles provide flanking for the ankou&#146;s shadow and his allies, but they do not possess teamwork feats or special abilities that alter the effects of flanking or aiding another. As a swift action, the ankou&#146;s shadow can direct his shadow doubles to use the aid another action, using his own base attack bonus plus his Intelligence modifier for the roll. Although a shadow double appears to duplicate the ankou&#146;s shadow&#146;s gear, this gear is part of its form; a shadow double&#146;s gear cannot be destroyed, dropped, or stolen. A shadow double disappears if it ventures more than 50 feet from the ankou&#146;s shadow or if it leaves his line of sight or effect. A shadow double that is hit by an attack roll or takes any damage is destroyed. The AC of a shadow double is equal to the ankou&#146;s shadow&#146;s touch AC, and it has the same CMD and saving throw bonuses as the ankou&#146;s shadow. Shadow doubles possess evasion if the ankou&#146;s shadow does. Mind-affecting effects targeting a shadow double affect the ankou&#146;s shadow instead, though he isn&#146;t affected twice by effects that target both him and a shadow double.</p>
					<p>At 10th level, an ankou&#146;s shadow gains a third shadow double. He can divide his actions between his actual body and his shadow doubles, using them as the origin point for attacks or abilities. For example, an ankou&#146;s shadow making three attacks as a part of a full attack could make his primary attack from his own body and his other two attacks from two of his shadow doubles.</p>
					<p>At 15th level, an ankou&#146;s shadow gains a fourth shadow double. In addition to the abilities above, an ankou&#146;s shadow can assign the doubles to perform simple tasks on their own, as the unseen servant spell, except that the shadow doubles have an effective Strength score of 10.</p>

				<name type="string">4th Studied Target</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A slayer can study an opponent he can see as a move action. The slayer then gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks attempted against that opponent, and a +1 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against it. The DCs of slayer class abilities against that opponent increase by 1. A slayer can only maintain these bonuses against one opponent at a time; these bonuses remain in effect until either the opponent is dead or the slayer studies a new target.</p>
					<p>If a slayer deals sneak attack damage to a target, he can study that target as an immediate action, allowing him to apply his studied target bonuses against that target (including to the normal weapon damage roll).</p>
					<p>At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the bonuses on weapon attack, damage rolls, and skill checks and to slayer DCs against a studied target increase by 1. In addition, at each such interval, the slayer is able to maintain these bonuses against an additional studied target at the same time. The slayer may discard this connection to a studied target as a free action, allowing him to study another target in its place.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Ankous are terrifying, winged fey assassins dispatched by the greatest lords of the First World to eliminate rivals. Some mortals emulate ankous to become the perfect assassins; others believe themselves to be ankous incarnated in mortal shells on a deep cover mission. In either case, an ankou&#146;s shadow practices the deadliest skills of the First World&#146;s most feared enforcers.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Skilled at tracking down targets, slayers are consummate hunters, living for the chase and the deadly stroke that brings it to a close. Slayers spend most of their time honing their weapon skills, studying the habits and anatomy of foes, and practicing combat maneuvers.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The slayer is elusive, and good at finding the opportune time and location to strike. Combining the deadliest talents of rangers and rogues, a slayer&#146;s abilities are all about getting into combat, dealing with a target, and then getting back out again.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A slayer is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, as well as with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
			<p><b>Shadow Double (Sp): </b>An ankou&#146;s shadow can take a full-round action to create a single, quasi-real, shadowy duplicate. This shadow double remains in his square, mimicking his movements as a single mirror image, except that it lasts until it is destroyed or he chooses to dismiss it as a swift action. This ability does not stack with the mirror image spell or with similar abilities, such as the copycat ability of the Trickery domain.</p>
			<p>At 5th level, an ankou&#146;s shadow gains a second shadow double. In addition to using these shadow doubles as mirror images in his square, he can move his doubles as part of his own move action, dividing his movement between himself and his doubles. When outside his square, shadow doubles do not protect the ankou&#146;s shadow as mirror image and are limited in the actions they can take. Shadow doubles provide flanking for the ankou&#146;s shadow and his allies, but they do not possess teamwork feats or special abilities that alter the effects of flanking or aiding another. As a swift action, the ankou&#146;s shadow can direct his shadow doubles to use the aid another action, using his own base attack bonus plus his Intelligence modifier for the roll. Although a shadow double appears to duplicate the ankou&#146;s shadow&#146;s gear, this gear is part of its form; a shadow double&#146;s gear cannot be destroyed, dropped, or stolen. A shadow double disappears if it ventures more than 50 feet from the ankou&#146;s shadow or if it leaves his line of sight or effect. A shadow double that is hit by an attack roll or takes any damage is destroyed. The AC of a shadow double is equal to the ankou&#146;s shadow&#146;s touch AC, and it has the same CMD and saving throw bonuses as the ankou&#146;s shadow. Shadow doubles possess evasion if the ankou&#146;s shadow does. Mind-affecting effects targeting a shadow double affect the ankou&#146;s shadow instead, though he isn&#146;t affected twice by effects that target both him and a shadow double.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, an ankou&#146;s shadow gains a third shadow double. He can divide his actions between his actual body and his shadow doubles, using them as the origin point for attacks or abilities. For example, an ankou&#146;s shadow making three attacks as a part of a full attack could make his primary attack from his own body and his other two attacks from two of his shadow doubles.</p>
			<p>At 15th level, an ankou&#146;s shadow gains a fourth shadow double. In addition to the abilities above, an ankou&#146;s shadow can assign the doubles to perform simple tasks on their own, as the unseen servant spell, except that the shadow doubles have an effective Strength score of 10.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces studied target.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>A slayer adds 1/2 his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer Talents: </b>As a slayer gains experience, he learns a number of talents that aid him and confound his foes. Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer gains one slayer talent. Unless otherwise noted, a slayer cannot select an individual talent more than once. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a slayer&#146;s sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision of which to use must be made before the attack roll is made.</p>
			<p><b>Sneak Attack: </b>At 3rd level, if a slayer catches an opponent unable to defend itself effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot for extra damage. The slayer&#146;s attack deals extra damage anytime his target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the slayer flanks his target. This additional damage is 1d6 at 3rd level, and increases by 1d6 every 3 levels thereafter. Should the slayer score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this additional damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p>
			<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or unarmed strike), a slayer can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. He cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual &#150;4 penalty.</p>
			<p>The slayer must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A slayer cannot use sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment.</p>
			<p><b>Ankou&#146;s Vision (Sp): </b>At 7th level, an ankou&#146;s shadow can use see invisibility, as per the spell, as a swift action for 1 minute per level per day. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces stalker.</p>
			<p><b>Advanced Talents: </b>At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer can select one of the following advanced talents in place of a slayer talent.</p>
			<p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex): </b>At 11th level, a slayer can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal &#150;5 penalty. When moving at up to twice his normal speed while tracking, he takes only a &#150;10 penalty instead of the normal &#150;20.</p>
			<p><b>Slayer&#146;s Advance (Ex): </b>At 13th level, a slayer can once per day move up to twice his base speed as a move action. He may use Stealth as part of this movement, but takes a &#150;10 penalty to his check for doing so. At 17th level, he can do this twice per day.</p>
			<p><b>Shadow Prey (Ex): </b>An ankou&#146;s shadow cannot denote a target as his quarry unless he has a shadow double present, but unlike other slayers, the target does not need to be one of his studied targets.</p>
			<p>This ability alters quarry and improved quarry.</p>
			<p><b>Quarry (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a slayer can as a standard action denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a slayer can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he gains a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats against his quarry are automatically conf irmed. A slayer can have no more than one quarry at a time, and the target must be selected as a studied target. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry target for 24 hours. If the slayer sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry target after 1 hour.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex): </b>At 19th level, the slayer&#146;s ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
			<p><b>Unfettered Shadows (Su): </b>At 20th level, as a standard action an ankou&#146;s shadow can unfetter all of his shadow doubles for 1 minute. While unfettered, each shadow double can move and attack as if it were the ankou&#146;s shadow without using any of his actions. A creature struck by a shadow double can attempt a Will save (DC 20 + the ankou&#146;s shadow&#146;s Intelligence modifier) each time it takes damage to recognize the illusion. If it succeeds, the target treats all the shadow doubles as 20% real, as the spell shadow conjuration. The shadow doubles cannot use the shadow double ability. The ankou&#146;s shadow can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Intelligence modifier.</p>
