					<p>An arcanist casts arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, presented in Chapter 10 of the Core Rulebook. An arcanist must prepare her spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, her spells are not expended when they&#146;re cast. Instead, she can cast any spell that she has prepared consuming a spell slot of the appropriate level, assuming she hasn&#146;t yet used up her spell slots per day for that level.</p>
					<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the arcanist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against an arcanist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
					<p>An arcanist can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3).</p>
					<p>An arcanist may know any number of spells, but the number she can prepare each day is limited. At 1st level, she can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new arcanist level, the number of spells she can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1&#150;2. Unlike the number of spells she can cast per day, the number of spells an arcanist can prepare each day is not affected by her Intelligence score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster instead affect the number of spells an arcanist can prepare.</p>
					<p>An arcanist must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the arcanist decides what spells to prepare and refreshes her available spell slots for the day.</p>
					<p>Like a sorcerer, an arcanist can choose to apply any metamagic feats she knows to a prepared spell as she casts it, with the same increase in casting time (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook). However, she may also prepare a spell with any metamagic feats she knows and cast it without increasing casting time like a wizard. She cannot combine these options&#151;a spell prepared with metamagic feats cannot be further modified with another metamagic feat at the time of casting (unless she has the metamixing arcanist exploit, detailed below).</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the arcanist learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic. Some of these exploits allow her to break down various forms of magic, adding their essence to her arcane reservoir. At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the arcanist learns a new arcane exploit selected from the following list. An arcanist exploit cannot be selected more than once. Once an arcanist exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 1st level, an arcanist can expend an available arcanist spell slot as a move action, making it unavailable for the rest of the day, just as if she had used it to cast a spell. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Doing this adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to the level of the spell slot consumed. She cannot consume cantrips (0 level spells) in this way. Points gained in excess of the reservoir&#146;s maximum are lost.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>An arcanist has an innate pool of magical energy that she can draw upon to fuel her arcanist exploits and enhance her spells. The arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to 3 + the arcanist&#146;s level. Each day, when preparing spells, the arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 her arcanist level. Any points she had from the previous day are lost. She can also regain these points through the consume spells class feature and some arcanist exploits. The arcane reservoir can never hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this total are lost.</p>
					<p>Points from the arcanist reservoir are used to fuel many of the arcanist&#146;s powers. In addition, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action whenever she casts an arcanist spell. If she does, she can choose to increase the caster level by 1 or increase the spell&#146;s DC by 1. She can expend no more than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.</p>

					<p>An arcanist must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She can&#146;t prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for read magic (which all arcanists can prepare from memory).</p>
					<p>An arcanist begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard/sorcerer spells plus three 1st-level spells of her choice. The arcanist also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new arcanist level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new arcanist level) for her spellbook. At any time, an arcanist can also add spells found in wizards' or other arcanists' spellbooks to her own.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p>-</p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some spellcasters seek the secrets of magic, pursuing the power to make the impossible possible. Others are born with magic in their blood, commanding unbelievable forces as effortlessly as they breathe. Yet still others seek to meld the science of arcane scholars with the natural might of innate casters. These arcanists seek to discover the mysterious laws of magic and through will and expertise bend those forces to their whims. Arcanists are the shapers and tinkers of the arcane world, and no magic can resist their control.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Arcanists are scholars of all things magical. They constantly seek out new forms of magic to discover how they work, and in many cases, to collect the energy of such magic for their own uses. Many arcanists are seen as reckless, more concerned with the potency of magic than the ramifications of unleashing such power.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Classes: </b>Sorcerer and wizard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>2d6 x 10 gp (average 70 gp).</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Arcanists are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with an arcanist&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail (see Arcane Spells and Armor).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An arcanist casts arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, presented in Chapter 10 of the Core Rulebook. An arcanist must prepare her spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, her spells are not expended when they&#146;re cast. Instead, she can cast any spell that she has prepared consuming a spell slot of the appropriate level, assuming she hasn&#146;t yet used up her spell slots per day for that level.</p>
			<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the arcanist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against an arcanist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An arcanist can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3).</p>
			<p>An arcanist may know any number of spells, but the number she can prepare each day is limited. At 1st level, she can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new arcanist level, the number of spells she can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1&#150;2. Unlike the number of spells she can cast per day, the number of spells an arcanist can prepare each day is not affected by her Intelligence score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster instead affect the number of spells an arcanist can prepare.</p>
			<p>An arcanist must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the arcanist decides what spells to prepare and refreshes her available spell slots for the day.</p>
			<p>Like a sorcerer, an arcanist can choose to apply any metamagic feats she knows to a prepared spell as she casts it, with the same increase in casting time (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook). However, she may also prepare a spell with any metamagic feats she knows and cast it without increasing casting time like a wizard. She cannot combine these options&#151;a spell prepared with metamagic feats cannot be further modified with another metamagic feat at the time of casting (unless she has the metamixing arcanist exploit, detailed below).</p>
			<p><b>Spellbooks: </b>An arcanist must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She can&#146;t prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for read magic (which all arcanists can prepare from memory).</p>
			<p>An arcanist begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard/sorcerer spells plus three 1st-level spells of her choice. The arcanist also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new arcanist level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new arcanist level) for her spellbook. At any time, an arcanist can also add spells found in wizards' or other arcanists' spellbooks to her own (see Arcane Magic Writings).</p>
			<p><b>Arcane Reservoir (Su): </b>An arcanist has an innate pool of magical energy that she can draw upon to fuel her arcanist exploits and enhance her spells. The arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to 3 + the arcanist&#146;s level. Each day, when preparing spells, the arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 her arcanist level. Any points she had from the previous day are lost. She can also regain these points through the consume spells class feature and some arcanist exploits. The arcane reservoir can never hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this total are lost.</p>
			<p>Points from the arcanist reservoir are used to fuel many of the arcanist&#146;s powers. In addition, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action whenever she casts an arcanist spell. If she does, she can choose to increase the caster level by 1 or increase the spell&#146;s DC by 1. She can expend no more than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.</p>
			<p><b>Arcanist Exploits: </b>By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the arcanist learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic. Some of these exploits allow her to break down various forms of magic, adding their essence to her arcane reservoir. At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the arcanist learns a new arcane exploit selected from the following list. An arcanist exploit cannot be selected more than once. Once an arcanist exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Arcanists can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;2. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume spell slots. As with her other spells, these spells are not expended when cast.</p>
			<p><b>Consume Spells (Su): </b>At 1st level, an arcanist can expend an available arcanist spell slot as a move action, making it unavailable for the rest of the day, just as if she had used it to cast a spell. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Doing this adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to the level of the spell slot consumed. She cannot consume cantrips (0 level spells) in this way. Points gained in excess of the reservoir&#146;s maximum are lost.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Exploits: </b>At 11th level and every 2 levels thereafter, an arcanist can choose one of the following greater exploits in place of an arcanist exploit.</p>
			<p><b>Magical Supremacy (Su): </b>At 20th level, the arcanist learns how to convert her arcane reservoir into spells and back again. She can cast any spell she has prepared by expending a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to 1 + the level of the spell to be cast instead of expending a spell slot. When she casts a spell in this fashion, she treats her caster level as 2 higher than normal, and the DCs of any saving throws associated with the spell increase by 2. She cannot further expend points from her arcane reservoir to enhance a spell cast in this way.</p>

She can choose which form the wind takes each time she uses the ability. The affected area is filled with hurricane-force winds (75 mph). This makes normal ranged attacks passing through this area impossible, imposes a &#150;8 penalty on ranged attacks from siege weapons that pass through the area, and imposes a &#150;12 penalty on Fly checks attempted within the area. Additionally, Large creatures in the area are in danger of being checked, and Medium or smaller creatures in the area are in danger of being blown away.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p>The undisputed masters of wind and sky unlocked numerous secrets of air magic. The vast majority of these secrets were lost when their civilization collapsed, but a few of their magical traditions have been preserved through the years. While the practice of aeromancy is rare, some arcanists today are able to rival the aerial mastery of the ancient aeromancers.</p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some spellcasters seek the secrets of magic, pursuing the power to make the impossible possible. Others are born with magic in their blood, commanding unbelievable forces as effortlessly as they breathe. Yet still others seek to meld the science of arcane scholars with the natural might of innate casters. These arcanists seek to discover the mysterious laws of magic and through will and expertise bend those forces to their whims. Arcanists are the shapers and tinkers of the arcane world, and no magic can resist their control.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Arcanists are scholars of all things magical. They constantly seek out new forms of magic to discover how they work, and in many cases, to collect the energy of such magic for their own uses. Many arcanists are seen as reckless, more concerned with the potency of magic than the ramifications of unleashing such power.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Classes: </b>Sorcerer and wizard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>2d6 x 10 gp (average 70 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Arcanist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Arcanists are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with an arcanist&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail (see Arcane Spells and Armor).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An arcanist casts arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, presented in Chapter 10 of the Core Rulebook. An arcanist must prepare her spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, her spells are not expended when they&#146;re cast. Instead, she can cast any spell that she has prepared consuming a spell slot of the appropriate level, assuming she hasn&#146;t yet used up her spell slots per day for that level.</p>
			<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the arcanist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against an arcanist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An arcanist can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3).</p>
			<p>An arcanist may know any number of spells, but the number she can prepare each day is limited. At 1st level, she can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new arcanist level, the number of spells she can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1&#150;2. Unlike the number of spells she can cast per day, the number of spells an arcanist can prepare each day is not affected by her Intelligence score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster instead affect the number of spells an arcanist can prepare.</p>
			<p>An arcanist must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the arcanist decides what spells to prepare and refreshes her available spell slots for the day.</p>
			<p>Like a sorcerer, an arcanist can choose to apply any metamagic feats she knows to a prepared spell as she casts it, with the same increase in casting time (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook). However, she may also prepare a spell with any metamagic feats she knows and cast it without increasing casting time like a wizard. She cannot combine these options&#151;a spell prepared with metamagic feats cannot be further modified with another metamagic feat at the time of casting (unless she has the metamixing arcanist exploit, detailed below).</p>
			<p><b>Spellbooks: </b>An arcanist must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She can&#146;t prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for read magic (which all arcanists can prepare from memory).</p>
			<p>An arcanist begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard/sorcerer spells plus three 1st-level spells of her choice. The arcanist also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new arcanist level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new arcanist level) for her spellbook. At any time, an arcanist can also add spells found in wizards' or other arcanists' spellbooks to her own (see Arcane Magic Writings).</p>
			<p><b>Arcane Reservoir (Su): </b>An arcanist has an innate pool of magical energy that she can draw upon to fuel her arcanist exploits and enhance her spells. The arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to 3 + the arcanist&#146;s level. Each day, when preparing spells, the arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 her arcanist level. Any points she had from the previous day are lost. She can also regain these points through the consume spells class feature and some arcanist exploits. The arcane reservoir can never hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this total are lost.</p>
			<p>Points from the arcanist reservoir are used to fuel many of the arcanist&#146;s powers. In addition, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action whenever she casts an arcanist spell. If she does, she can choose to increase the caster level by 1 or increase the spell&#146;s DC by 1. She can expend no more than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.</p>
			<p><b>Arcanist Exploits: </b>By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the arcanist learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic. Some of these exploits allow her to break down various forms of magic, adding their essence to her arcane reservoir. At 4st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the arcanist learns a new arcane exploit selected from the following list. An arcanist exploit cannot be selected more than once. Once an arcanist exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Arcanists can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;2. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume spell slots. As with her other spells, these spells are not expended when cast.</p>
			<p><b>Consume Spells (Su): </b>At 1st level, an arcanist can expend an available arcanist spell slot as a move action, making it unavailable for the rest of the day, just as if she had used it to cast a spell. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Doing this adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to the level of the spell slot consumed. She cannot consume cantrips (0 level spells) in this way. Points gained in excess of the reservoir&#146;s maximum are lost.</p>
			<p><b>Air Mastery (Su): </b>Aeromancers specialize in magic that manipulates the wind and sky. Whenever an aeromancer expends a point from her arcane reservoir to increase the caster level of a spell with the air, cold, electricity, or sonic descriptor, she increases that bonus by an additional 1. At 5th level, and every 5 levels thereafter, the amount by which she increases the caster level of such spells further increases by an additional 1 (to a maximum additional caster level increase from this ability of 5 at 20th level).</p>
			<p>Alternatively, if the aeromancer expends a point from her arcane reservoir to increase the saving throw DC of a spell with the air, cold, electricity, or sonic descriptor, she increases it by an additional 1. At 10th level, she increases it by an additional 2 instead.</p>
			<p>This replaces the arcane exploit gained at 1st level.</p>
			<p><b>Wind&#146;s Embrace (Su): </b>At 5th level, an aeromancer can expend 2 points from her arcane reservoir to call upon the winds to gently carry her through the air while protecting her from harm. She is affected as though by the spell air walk and is surrounded by protective winds that function similarly to a wind wall spell, except the effect surrounds only the aeromancer and moves with her wherever she goes. Both of these effects last for 1 minute.</p>
			<p>This replaces the arcane exploit gained at 5th level.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Exploits: </b>At 11th level and every 2 levels thereafter, an arcanist can choose one of the following greater exploits in place of an arcanist exploit.</p>
			<p><b>Rebuking Gale (Su): </b>At 11th level, by expending 3 points from her arcane reservoir, an aeromancer can release a powerful blast of wind to push back her foes. This takes the form of either a 20-foot-radius burst centered on the aeromancer or a 40-foot cone originating from the aeromancer&#146;s space. She can choose which form the wind takes each time she uses the ability. The affected area is filled with hurricane-force winds (75 mph). This makes normal ranged attacks passing through this area impossible, imposes a &#150;8 penalty on ranged attacks from siege weapons that pass through the area, and imposes a &#150;12 penalty on Fly checks attempted within the area. Additionally, Large creatures in the area are in danger of being checked, and Medium or smaller creatures in the area are in danger of being blown away. The winds created by this ability last for 1 round.</p>
			<p>This replaces the arcane exploit gained at 11th level.</p>
			<p>Magical Supremacy (Su): At 20th level, the arcanist learns how to convert her arcane reservoir into spells and back again. She can cast any spell she has prepared by expending a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to 1 + the level of the spell to be cast instead of expending a spell slot. When she casts a spell in this fashion, she treats her caster level as 2 higher than normal, and the DCs of any saving throws associated with the spell increase by 2. She cannot further expend points from her arcane reservoir to enhance a spell cast in this way.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p>All constructs are animated by magic in some capacity. Arcane tinkerers use their knowledge and understanding of magic to disrupt or even destroy constructs.</p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some spellcasters seek the secrets of magic, pursuing the power to make the impossible possible. Others are born with magic in their blood, commanding unbelievable forces as effortlessly as they breathe. Yet still others seek to meld the science of arcane scholars with the natural might of innate casters. These arcanists seek to discover the mysterious laws of magic and through will and expertise bend those forces to their whims. Arcanists are the shapers and tinkers of the arcane world, and no magic can resist their control.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Arcanists are scholars of all things magical. They constantly seek out new forms of magic to discover how they work, and in many cases, to collect the energy of such magic for their own uses. Many arcanists are seen as reckless, more concerned with the potency of magic than the ramifications of unleashing such power.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Classes: </b>Sorcerer and wizard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>2d6 x 10 gp (average 70 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Arcanist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Arcanists are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with an arcanist&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail (see Arcane Spells and Armor).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An arcanist casts arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, presented in Chapter 10 of the Core Rulebook. An arcanist must prepare her spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, her spells are not expended when they&#146;re cast. Instead, she can cast any spell that she has prepared consuming a spell slot of the appropriate level, assuming she hasn&#146;t yet used up her spell slots per day for that level.</p>
			<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the arcanist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against an arcanist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An arcanist can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3).</p>
			<p>An arcanist may know any number of spells, but the number she can prepare each day is limited. At 1st level, she can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new arcanist level, the number of spells she can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1&#150;2. Unlike the number of spells she can cast per day, the number of spells an arcanist can prepare each day is not affected by her Intelligence score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster instead affect the number of spells an arcanist can prepare.</p>
			<p>An arcanist must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the arcanist decides what spells to prepare and refreshes her available spell slots for the day.</p>
			<p>Like a sorcerer, an arcanist can choose to apply any metamagic feats she knows to a prepared spell as she casts it, with the same increase in casting time (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook). However, she may also prepare a spell with any metamagic feats she knows and cast it without increasing casting time like a wizard. She cannot combine these options&#151;a spell prepared with metamagic feats cannot be further modified with another metamagic feat at the time of casting (unless she has the metamixing arcanist exploit, detailed below).</p>
			<p><b>Spellbooks: </b>An arcanist must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She can&#146;t prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for read magic (which all arcanists can prepare from memory).</p>
			<p>An arcanist begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard/sorcerer spells plus three 1st-level spells of her choice. The arcanist also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new arcanist level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new arcanist level) for her spellbook. At any time, an arcanist can also add spells found in wizards' or other arcanists' spellbooks to her own (see Arcane Magic Writings).</p>
			<p><b>Arcane Reservoir (Su): </b>An arcanist has an innate pool of magical energy that she can draw upon to fuel her arcanist exploits and enhance her spells. The arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to 3 + the arcanist&#146;s level. Each day, when preparing spells, the arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 her arcanist level. Any points she had from the previous day are lost. She can also regain these points through the consume spells class feature and some arcanist exploits. The arcane reservoir can never hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this total are lost.</p>
			<p>Points from the arcanist reservoir are used to fuel many of the arcanist&#146;s powers. In addition, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action whenever she casts an arcanist spell. If she does, she can choose to increase the caster level by 1 or increase the spell&#146;s DC by 1. She can expend no more than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.</p>
			<p><b>Arcanist Exploits: </b>By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the arcanist learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic. Some of these exploits allow her to break down various forms of magic, adding their essence to her arcane reservoir. At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the arcanist learns a new arcane exploit selected from the following list. An arcanist exploit cannot be selected more than once. Once an arcanist exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Arcanists can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;2. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume spell slots. As with her other spells, these spells are not expended when cast.</p>
			<p><b>Consume Spells (Su): </b>At 1st level, an arcanist can expend an available arcanist spell slot as a move action, making it unavailable for the rest of the day, just as if she had used it to cast a spell. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Doing this adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to the level of the spell slot consumed. She cannot consume cantrips (0 level spells) in this way. Points gained in excess of the reservoir&#146;s maximum are lost.</p>
			<p><b>Manipulate Construct (Su): </b>An arcane tinkerer can turn the animating magic of a construct against itself. As a standard action, she can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to impose a &#150;1 penalty on a single construct&#146;s attack and damage rolls for 1 round. The target can attempt a Will save to negate this effect (DC = 10 + half the arcane tinkerer&#146;s level + the arcane tinkerer&#146;s Charisma modifier). At 7th level, instead of gaining an arcanist exploit, an arcane tinkerer can improve her manipulate construct ability to instead affect a construct with slow for 1 round. At 13th level, if the arcane tinkerer has previously improved this ability, instead of gaining an arcanist exploit, she can improve this ability again to instead cause a construct to become helpless for 1 round.</p>
			<p>This replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 1st level.</p>
			<p><b>Break Magic Immunity (Su): </b>At 5th level, an arcane tinkerer can overcome a construct&#146;s immunity to magic. When targeting a construct with a spell, the construct is instead treated as if it has spell resistance equal to 15 + the construct&#146;s CR. At 11th level, a construct is instead treated as if it has spell resistance equal to 11 + the construct&#146;s CR.</p>
			<p>This replaces the arcanist exploits gained at 5th and 11th level.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Exploits: </b>At 11th level and every 2 levels thereafter, an arcanist can choose one of the following greater exploits in place of an arcanist exploit.</p>
			<p><b>Magical Supremacy (Su): </b>At 20th level, the arcanist learns how to convert her arcane reservoir into spells and back again. She can cast any spell she has prepared by expending a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to 1 + the level of the spell to be cast instead of expending a spell slot. When she casts a spell in this fashion, she treats her caster level as 2 higher than normal, and the DCs of any saving throws associated with the spell increase by 2. She cannot further expend points from her arcane reservoir to enhance a spell cast in this way.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p>A small number of arcanists learn to use blades as part of their spellcasting and in combat. While these blade adepts are not as capable with a sword as a true master duelist, their combination of swordplay and arcane power makes them quite deadly.</p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some spellcasters seek the secrets of magic, pursuing the power to make the impossible possible. Others are born with magic in their blood, commanding unbelievable forces as effortlessly as they breathe. Yet still others seek to meld the science of arcane scholars with the natural might of innate casters. These arcanists seek to discover the mysterious laws of magic and through will and expertise bend those forces to their whims. Arcanists are the shapers and tinkers of the arcane world, and no magic can resist their control.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Arcanists are scholars of all things magical. They constantly seek out new forms of magic to discover how they work, and in many cases, to collect the energy of such magic for their own uses. Many arcanists are seen as reckless, more concerned with the potency of magic than the ramifications of unleashing such power.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Classes: </b>Sorcerer and wizard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>2d6 x 10 gp (average 70 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Arcanist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Arcanists are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with an arcanist&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail (see Arcane Spells and Armor).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An arcanist casts arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, presented in Chapter 10 of the Core Rulebook. An arcanist must prepare her spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, her spells are not expended when they&#146;re cast. Instead, she can cast any spell that she has prepared consuming a spell slot of the appropriate level, assuming she hasn&#146;t yet used up her spell slots per day for that level.</p>
			<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the arcanist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against an arcanist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An arcanist can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3).</p>
			<p>An arcanist may know any number of spells, but the number she can prepare each day is limited. At 1st level, she can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new arcanist level, the number of spells she can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1&#150;2. Unlike the number of spells she can cast per day, the number of spells an arcanist can prepare each day is not affected by her Intelligence score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster instead affect the number of spells an arcanist can prepare.</p>
			<p>An arcanist must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the arcanist decides what spells to prepare and refreshes her available spell slots for the day.</p>
			<p>Like a sorcerer, an arcanist can choose to apply any metamagic feats she knows to a prepared spell as she casts it, with the same increase in casting time (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook). However, she may also prepare a spell with any metamagic feats she knows and cast it without increasing casting time like a wizard. She cannot combine these options&#151;a spell prepared with metamagic feats cannot be further modified with another metamagic feat at the time of casting (unless she has the metamixing arcanist exploit, detailed below).</p>
			<p><b>Spellbooks: </b>An arcanist must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She can&#146;t prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for read magic (which all arcanists can prepare from memory).</p>
			<p>An arcanist begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard/sorcerer spells plus three 1st-level spells of her choice. The arcanist also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new arcanist level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new arcanist level) for her spellbook. At any time, an arcanist can also add spells found in wizards' or other arcanists' spellbooks to her own (see Arcane Magic Writings).</p>
			<p><b>Arcane Reservoir (Su): </b>An arcanist has an innate pool of magical energy that she can draw upon to fuel her arcanist exploits and enhance her spells. The arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to 3 + the arcanist&#146;s level. Each day, when preparing spells, the arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 her arcanist level. Any points she had from the previous day are lost. She can also regain these points through the consume spells class feature and some arcanist exploits. The arcane reservoir can never hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this total are lost.</p>
			<p>Points from the arcanist reservoir are used to fuel many of the arcanist&#146;s powers. In addition, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action whenever she casts an arcanist spell. If she does, she can choose to increase the caster level by 1 or increase the spell&#146;s DC by 1. She can expend no more than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.</p>
			<p><b>Arcanist Exploits: </b>By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the arcanist learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic. Some of these exploits allow her to break down various forms of magic, adding their essence to her arcane reservoir. At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the arcanist learns a new arcane exploit selected from the following list. An arcanist exploit cannot be selected more than once. Once an arcanist exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Adept Exploits: </b>A blade adept can select from additional adept exploits.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Arcanists can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;2. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume spell slots. As with her other spells, these spells are not expended when cast.</p>
			<p><b>Consume Spells (Su): </b>At 1st level, an arcanist can expend an available arcanist spell slot as a move action, making it unavailable for the rest of the day, just as if she had used it to cast a spell. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Doing this adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to the level of the spell slot consumed. She cannot consume cantrips (0 level spells) in this way. Points gained in excess of the reservoir&#146;s maximum are lost.</p>
			<p><b>Sword Bond (Su): </b>At 1st level, a blade adept develops a bond with a blade and infuses it with arcane power. This ability works like a wizard&#146;s arcane bond ability save that the blade adept must bond to a one-handed piercing or slashing melee weapon. Additionally, the blade adept gains proficiency with the weapon if it is a simple or martial weapon. This ability replaces the arcanist exploits gained at 1st and 9th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Sentient Sword (Su): </b>At 3rd level, the blade adept&#146;s bonded sword becomes a powerful, sentient black blade. The blade advances as a black blade using the blade adept&#146;s class level in place of the magus&#146;s class level and points from her arcane reservoir in place of the magus&#146;s arcane pool. A blade adept with this class feature cannot have a familiar of any kind, even from another class. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Exploits: </b>At 11th level and every 2 levels thereafter, an arcanist can choose one of the following greater exploits in place of an arcanist exploit.</p>
			<p><b>Magical Supremacy (Su): </b>At 20th level, the arcanist learns how to convert her arcane reservoir into spells and back again. She can cast any spell she has prepared by expending a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to 1 + the level of the spell to be cast instead of expending a spell slot. When she casts a spell in this fashion, she treats her caster level as 2 higher than normal, and the DCs of any saving throws associated with the spell increase by 2. She cannot further expend points from her arcane reservoir to enhance a spell cast in this way.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p>Though most arcanists possess only a rudimentary innate arcane gift, the blood arcanist has the full power of a bloodline to draw upon.</p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some spellcasters seek the secrets of magic, pursuing the power to make the impossible possible. Others are born with magic in their blood, commanding unbelievable forces as effortlessly as they breathe. Yet still others seek to meld the science of arcane scholars with the natural might of innate casters. These arcanists seek to discover the mysterious laws of magic and through will and expertise bend those forces to their whims. Arcanists are the shapers and tinkers of the arcane world, and no magic can resist their control.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Arcanists are scholars of all things magical. They constantly seek out new forms of magic to discover how they work, and in many cases, to collect the energy of such magic for their own uses. Many arcanists are seen as reckless, more concerned with the potency of magic than the ramifications of unleashing such power.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Classes: </b>Sorcerer and wizard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>2d6 x 10 gp (average 70 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Arcanist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Arcanists are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with an arcanist&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail (see Arcane Spells and Armor).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An arcanist casts arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, presented in Chapter 10 of the Core Rulebook. An arcanist must prepare her spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, her spells are not expended when they&#146;re cast. Instead, she can cast any spell that she has prepared consuming a spell slot of the appropriate level, assuming she hasn&#146;t yet used up her spell slots per day for that level.</p>
			<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the arcanist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against an arcanist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An arcanist can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3).</p>
			<p>An arcanist may know any number of spells, but the number she can prepare each day is limited. At 1st level, she can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new arcanist level, the number of spells she can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1&#150;2. Unlike the number of spells she can cast per day, the number of spells an arcanist can prepare each day is not affected by her Intelligence score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster instead affect the number of spells an arcanist can prepare.</p>
			<p>An arcanist must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the arcanist decides what spells to prepare and refreshes her available spell slots for the day.</p>
			<p>Like a sorcerer, an arcanist can choose to apply any metamagic feats she knows to a prepared spell as she casts it, with the same increase in casting time (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook). However, she may also prepare a spell with any metamagic feats she knows and cast it without increasing casting time like a wizard. She cannot combine these options&#151;a spell prepared with metamagic feats cannot be further modified with another metamagic feat at the time of casting (unless she has the metamixing arcanist exploit, detailed below).</p>
			<p><b>Spellbooks: </b>An arcanist must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She can&#146;t prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for read magic (which all arcanists can prepare from memory).</p>
			<p>An arcanist begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard/sorcerer spells plus three 1st-level spells of her choice. The arcanist also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new arcanist level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new arcanist level) for her spellbook. At any time, an arcanist can also add spells found in wizards' or other arcanists' spellbooks to her own (see Arcane Magic Writings).</p>
			<p><b>Arcane Reservoir (Su): </b>An arcanist has an innate pool of magical energy that she can draw upon to fuel her arcanist exploits and enhance her spells. The arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to 3 + the arcanist&#146;s level. Each day, when preparing spells, the arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 her arcanist level. Any points she had from the previous day are lost. She can also regain these points through the consume spells class feature and some arcanist exploits. The arcane reservoir can never hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this total are lost.</p>
			<p>Points from the arcanist reservoir are used to fuel many of the arcanist&#146;s powers. In addition, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action whenever she casts an arcanist spell. If she does, she can choose to increase the caster level by 1 or increase the spell&#146;s DC by 1. She can expend no more than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.</p>
			<p><b>Arcanist Exploits: </b>By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the arcanist learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic. Some of these exploits allow her to break down various forms of magic, adding their essence to her arcane reservoir. At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the arcanist learns a new arcane exploit selected from the following list. An arcanist exploit cannot be selected more than once. Once an arcanist exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Bloodline: </b>A blood arcanist selects one bloodline from those available through the sorcerer bloodline class feature. The blood arcanist gains the bloodline arcana and bloodline powers of that bloodline, treating her arcanist level as her sorcerer level. The blood arcanist does not gain the class skill, bonus feats, or bonus spells from her bloodline.</p>
			<p>If the blood arcanist takes levels in another class that grants a bloodline, the bloodlines must be the same type, even if that means that the bloodline of one of her classes must change. Subject to GM discretion, the blood arcanist can change her former bloodline to make them conform.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Arcanists can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;2. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume spell slots. As with her other spells, these spells are not expended when cast.</p>
			<p><b>Consume Spells (Su): </b>At 1st level, an arcanist can expend an available arcanist spell slot as a move action, making it unavailable for the rest of the day, just as if she had used it to cast a spell. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Doing this adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to the level of the spell slot consumed. She cannot consume cantrips (0 level spells) in this way. Points gained in excess of the reservoir&#146;s maximum are lost.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Exploits: </b>At 11th level and every 2 levels thereafter, an arcanist can choose one of the following greater exploits in place of an arcanist exploit.</p>
			<p><b>Magical Supremacy (Su): </b>At 20th level, the arcanist learns how to convert her arcane reservoir into spells and back again. She can cast any spell she has prepared by expending a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to 1 + the level of the spell to be cast instead of expending a spell slot. When she casts a spell in this fashion, she treats her caster level as 2 higher than normal, and the DCs of any saving throws associated with the spell increase by 2. She cannot further expend points from her arcane reservoir to enhance a spell cast in this way.</p>

At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the arcanist learns a new arcane exploit selected from the following list. An arcanist exploit cannot be selected more than once. Once an arcanist exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level, the brown-fur transmuter learns to harness the power of her magic to empower her transmutations. Whenever the brown-fur transmuter casts a transmutation spell using one of her arcanist spell slots, she can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action to bolster the spell. If the spell grants a bonus to an ability score, the bonus then increases by 2. If it grants a bonus to more than one ability score, only one of the ability scores gains this bonus. The brownfur transmuter cannot expend more than 1 point from her arcane reservoir in this way. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 3rd level.</p>

					<p>At 1st level, an arcanist can expend an available arcanist spell slot as a move action, making it unavailable for the rest of the day, just as if she had used it to cast a spell. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Doing this adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to the level of the spell slot consumed. She cannot consume cantrips (0 level spells) in this way. Points gained in excess of the reservoir&#146;s maximum are lost.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p>Frequently called &#147;brown-furs,&#148; these transmutation-focused arcanists are known for transforming themselves into animals. What few realize is that these specialized arcanists excel at turning themselves&#151;and others&#151;into all kinds of creatures.</p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some spellcasters seek the secrets of magic, pursuing the power to make the impossible possible. Others are born with magic in their blood, commanding unbelievable forces as effortlessly as they breathe. Yet still others seek to meld the science of arcane scholars with the natural might of innate casters. These arcanists seek to discover the mysterious laws of magic and through will and expertise bend those forces to their whims. Arcanists are the shapers and tinkers of the arcane world, and no magic can resist their control.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Arcanists are scholars of all things magical. They constantly seek out new forms of magic to discover how they work, and in many cases, to collect the energy of such magic for their own uses. Many arcanists are seen as reckless, more concerned with the potency of magic than the ramifications of unleashing such power.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Classes: </b>Sorcerer and wizard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>2d6 x 10 gp (average 70 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Arcanist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Arcanists are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with an arcanist&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail (see Arcane Spells and Armor).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An arcanist casts arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, presented in Chapter 10 of the Core Rulebook. An arcanist must prepare her spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, her spells are not expended when they&#146;re cast. Instead, she can cast any spell that she has prepared consuming a spell slot of the appropriate level, assuming she hasn&#146;t yet used up her spell slots per day for that level.</p>
			<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the arcanist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against an arcanist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An arcanist can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3).</p>
			<p>An arcanist may know any number of spells, but the number she can prepare each day is limited. At 1st level, she can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new arcanist level, the number of spells she can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1&#150;2. Unlike the number of spells she can cast per day, the number of spells an arcanist can prepare each day is not affected by her Intelligence score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster instead affect the number of spells an arcanist can prepare.</p>
			<p>An arcanist must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the arcanist decides what spells to prepare and refreshes her available spell slots for the day.</p>
			<p>Like a sorcerer, an arcanist can choose to apply any metamagic feats she knows to a prepared spell as she casts it, with the same increase in casting time (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook). However, she may also prepare a spell with any metamagic feats she knows and cast it without increasing casting time like a wizard. She cannot combine these options&#151;a spell prepared with metamagic feats cannot be further modified with another metamagic feat at the time of casting (unless she has the metamixing arcanist exploit, detailed below).</p>
			<p><b>Spellbooks: </b>An arcanist must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She can&#146;t prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for read magic (which all arcanists can prepare from memory).</p>
			<p>An arcanist begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard/sorcerer spells plus three 1st-level spells of her choice. The arcanist also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new arcanist level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new arcanist level) for her spellbook. At any time, an arcanist can also add spells found in wizards' or other arcanists' spellbooks to her own (see Arcane Magic Writings).</p>
			<p><b>Arcane Reservoir (Su): </b>An arcanist has an innate pool of magical energy that she can draw upon to fuel her arcanist exploits and enhance her spells. The arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to 3 + the arcanist&#146;s level. Each day, when preparing spells, the arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 her arcanist level. Any points she had from the previous day are lost. She can also regain these points through the consume spells class feature and some arcanist exploits. The arcane reservoir can never hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this total are lost.</p>
			<p>Points from the arcanist reservoir are used to fuel many of the arcanist&#146;s powers. In addition, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action whenever she casts an arcanist spell. If she does, she can choose to increase the caster level by 1 or increase the spell&#146;s DC by 1. She can expend no more than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.</p>
			<p><b>Arcanist Exploits: </b>By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the arcanist learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic. Some of these exploits allow her to break down various forms of magic, adding their essence to her arcane reservoir. At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the arcanist learns a new arcane exploit selected from the following list. An arcanist exploit cannot be selected more than once. Once an arcanist exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Arcanists can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;2. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume spell slots. As with her other spells, these spells are not expended when cast.</p>
			<p><b>Consume Spells (Su): </b>At 1st level, an arcanist can expend an available arcanist spell slot as a move action, making it unavailable for the rest of the day, just as if she had used it to cast a spell. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Doing this adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to the level of the spell slot consumed. She cannot consume cantrips (0 level spells) in this way. Points gained in excess of the reservoir&#146;s maximum are lost.</p>
			<p><b>Powerful Change (Su): </b>At 3rd level, the brown-fur transmuter learns to harness the power of her magic to empower her transmutations. Whenever the brown-fur transmuter casts a transmutation spell using one of her arcanist spell slots, she can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action to bolster the spell. If the spell grants a bonus to an ability score, the bonus then increases by 2. If it grants a bonus to more than one ability score, only one of the ability scores gains this bonus. The brownfur transmuter cannot expend more than 1 point from her arcane reservoir in this way. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Share Transmutation (Su): </b>At 9th level, the brown-fur transmuter can target others with her transmutation spells. A brown-fur transmuter can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to change any transmutation spell with a range of personal to a range of touch. Such a spell automatically fails on unwilling creatures. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 9th level.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Exploits: </b>At 11th level and every 2 levels thereafter, an arcanist can choose one of the following greater exploits in place of an arcanist exploit.</p>
			<p><b>Transmutation Supremacy (Su): </b>At 20th level, the brown-fur transmuter learns to fully master the power of transmutation. Whenever she casts a transmutation spell, it is treated as it were affected by the Extend Spell feat without altering the casting time or slot used. (She cannot then alter its duration again with the Extend Spell feat). Whenever she uses her powerful change ability, the bonus increases by 4 instead of 2. Her share transmutation ability can now target a willing creature within 30 feet. This ability replaces magical supremacy. <b></b></p>

					<p>An arcanist casts arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, presented in Chapter 10 of the Core Rulebook. An arcanist must prepare her spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, her spells are not expended when they&#146;re cast. Instead, she can cast any spell that she has prepared consuming a spell slot of the appropriate level, assuming she hasn&#146;t yet used up her spell slots per day for that level.</p>
					<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the arcanist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against an arcanist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
					<p>An arcanist can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3).</p>
					<p>An arcanist may know any number of spells, but the number she can prepare each day is limited. At 1st level, she can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new arcanist level, the number of spells she can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1&#150;2. Unlike the number of spells she can cast per day, the number of spells an arcanist can prepare each day is not affected by her Intelligence score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster instead affect the number of spells an arcanist can prepare.</p>
					<p>An arcanist must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the arcanist decides what spells to prepare and refreshes her available spell slots for the day.</p>
					<p>Like a sorcerer, an arcanist can choose to apply any metamagic feats she knows to a prepared spell as she casts it, with the same increase in casting time (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook). However, she may also prepare a spell with any metamagic feats she knows and cast it without increasing casting time like a wizard. She cannot combine these options&#151;a spell prepared with metamagic feats cannot be further modified with another metamagic feat at the time of casting (unless she has the metamixing arcanist exploit, detailed below).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p>For some arcanists, the power bubbling up from within is nearly too much to contain. They become adept at shaping this magical energy without needing to bind it up in spells.</p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some spellcasters seek the secrets of magic, pursuing the power to make the impossible possible. Others are born with magic in their blood, commanding unbelievable forces as effortlessly as they breathe. Yet still others seek to meld the science of arcane scholars with the natural might of innate casters. These arcanists seek to discover the mysterious laws of magic and through will and expertise bend those forces to their whims. Arcanists are the shapers and tinkers of the arcane world, and no magic can resist their control.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Arcanists are scholars of all things magical. They constantly seek out new forms of magic to discover how they work, and in many cases, to collect the energy of such magic for their own uses. Many arcanists are seen as reckless, more concerned with the potency of magic than the ramifications of unleashing such power.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Classes: </b>Sorcerer and wizard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>2d6 x 10 gp (average 70 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Arcanist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Arcanists are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with an arcanist&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail (see Arcane Spells and Armor).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An arcanist casts arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, presented in Chapter 10 of the Core Rulebook. An arcanist must prepare her spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, her spells are not expended when they&#146;re cast. Instead, she can cast any spell that she has prepared consuming a spell slot of the appropriate level, assuming she hasn&#146;t yet used up her spell slots per day for that level.</p>
			<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the arcanist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against an arcanist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An arcanist can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3).</p>
			<p>An arcanist may know any number of spells, but the number she can prepare each day is limited. At 1st level, she can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new arcanist level, the number of spells she can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1&#150;2. Unlike the number of spells she can cast per day, the number of spells an arcanist can prepare each day is not affected by her Intelligence score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster instead affect the number of spells an arcanist can prepare.</p>
			<p>An arcanist must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the arcanist decides what spells to prepare and refreshes her available spell slots for the day.</p>
			<p>Like a sorcerer, an arcanist can choose to apply any metamagic feats she knows to a prepared spell as she casts it, with the same increase in casting time (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook). However, she may also prepare a spell with any metamagic feats she knows and cast it without increasing casting time like a wizard. She cannot combine these options&#151;a spell prepared with metamagic feats cannot be further modified with another metamagic feat at the time of casting (unless she has the metamixing arcanist exploit, detailed below).</p>
			<p><b>Spellbooks: </b>An arcanist must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She can&#146;t prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for read magic (which all arcanists can prepare from memory).</p>
			<p>An arcanist begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard/sorcerer spells plus three 1st-level spells of her choice. The arcanist also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new arcanist level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new arcanist level) for her spellbook. At any time, an arcanist can also add spells found in wizards' or other arcanists' spellbooks to her own (see Arcane Magic Writings).</p>
			<p><b>Arcane Reservoir (Su): </b>An arcanist has an innate pool of magical energy that she can draw upon to fuel her arcanist exploits and enhance her spells. The arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to 3 + the arcanist&#146;s level. Each day, when preparing spells, the arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 her arcanist level. Any points she had from the previous day are lost. She can also regain these points through the consume spells class feature and some arcanist exploits. The arcane reservoir can never hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this total are lost.</p>
			<p>Points from the arcanist reservoir are used to fuel many of the arcanist&#146;s powers. In addition, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action whenever she casts an arcanist spell. If she does, she can choose to increase the caster level by 1 or increase the spell&#146;s DC by 1. She can expend no more than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.</p>
			<p><b>Arcanist Exploits: </b>By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the arcanist learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic. Some of these exploits allow her to break down various forms of magic, adding their essence to her arcane reservoir. At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the arcanist learns a new arcane exploit selected from the following list. An arcanist exploit cannot be selected more than once. Once an arcanist exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Arcanists can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;2. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume spell slots. As with her other spells, these spells are not expended when cast.</p>
			<p><b>Consume Spells (Su): </b>At 1st level, an arcanist can expend an available arcanist spell slot as a move action, making it unavailable for the rest of the day, just as if she had used it to cast a spell. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Doing this adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to the level of the spell slot consumed. She cannot consume cantrips (0 level spells) in this way. Points gained in excess of the reservoir&#146;s maximum are lost.</p>
			<p><b>Font of Power: </b>An eldritch font gains one additional spell slot for each level of arcanist spell she can cast. However, the number of spells of each level that she can prepare reduces by 1. If this reduces her spells prepared for a level to 0, she still gains spell slots of that level, which can be consumed using the consume spells class feature to fuel her arcane reservoir or cast spells using metamagic feats.</p>
			<p><b>Eldritch Surge (Su): </b>At 3rd level, an eldritch font can, as a swift action, pour more power into her spells and abilities. She can add 2 to the caster level and DC of a spell, or increase her effective arcanist level by 2 when using an arcanist exploit. She becomes fatigued upon using this ability. If she is already fatigued, she becomes exhausted. If she&#146;s already exhausted, or something would prevent her from becoming fatigued or exhausted, she cannot use this ability. This ability does not stack with spending points from her arcane reservoir to increase the spell&#146;s caster level or DC (as the arcane reservoir class feature). Only rest can remove fatigue or exhaustion caused by an eldritch surge&#151;spells and abilities have no effect. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Surge (Su): </b>At 7th level, an eldritch font can use her eldritch surge ability to reroll an attack roll associated with a spell or arcanist exploit, or to reroll all of the damage dice associated with a spell or arcanist exploit. In the case of attack rolls, this ability must be used after the die is rolled but before the results are revealed. The eldritch font must take the results of the reroll, even if they are lower. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 7th level.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Exploits: </b>At 11th level and every 2 levels thereafter, an arcanist can choose one of the following greater exploits in place of an arcanist exploit.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Surge (Su): </b>At 13th level, an eldritch font can use her eldritch surge ability to force a creature to reroll a saving throw against one spell or arcanist exploit and take the lower value. The eldritch font must declare the use of this ability before the result of that creature&#146;s saving throw is revealed. If the spell or arcanist exploit affects more than one target, only one target is affected by this ability. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 13th level.</p>
			<p><b>Bottomless Well: </b>At 20th level, an eldritch font can spend 1 hour studying her spellbook to refuel herself. Doing so allows her to prepare new spells and regain points of arcane reservoir equal to 1/2 her level. She can use this ability multiple times per day, however she still only regains spell slots once per day. This ability replaces magical supremacy.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p>Arcanists with an affinity for elemental forces sometimes focus on one and display its power in everything they do.</p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some spellcasters seek the secrets of magic, pursuing the power to make the impossible possible. Others are born with magic in their blood, commanding unbelievable forces as effortlessly as they breathe. Yet still others seek to meld the science of arcane scholars with the natural might of innate casters. These arcanists seek to discover the mysterious laws of magic and through will and expertise bend those forces to their whims. Arcanists are the shapers and tinkers of the arcane world, and no magic can resist their control.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Arcanists are scholars of all things magical. They constantly seek out new forms of magic to discover how they work, and in many cases, to collect the energy of such magic for their own uses. Many arcanists are seen as reckless, more concerned with the potency of magic than the ramifications of unleashing such power.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Classes: </b>Sorcerer and wizard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>2d6 x 10 gp (average 70 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Arcanist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Arcanists are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with an arcanist&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail (see Arcane Spells and Armor).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An arcanist casts arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, presented in Chapter 10 of the Core Rulebook. An arcanist must prepare her spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, her spells are not expended when they&#146;re cast. Instead, she can cast any spell that she has prepared consuming a spell slot of the appropriate level, assuming she hasn&#146;t yet used up her spell slots per day for that level.</p>
			<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the arcanist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against an arcanist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An arcanist can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3).</p>
			<p>An arcanist may know any number of spells, but the number she can prepare each day is limited. At 1st level, she can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new arcanist level, the number of spells she can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1&#150;2. Unlike the number of spells she can cast per day, the number of spells an arcanist can prepare each day is not affected by her Intelligence score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster instead affect the number of spells an arcanist can prepare.</p>
			<p>An arcanist must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the arcanist decides what spells to prepare and refreshes her available spell slots for the day.</p>
			<p>Like a sorcerer, an arcanist can choose to apply any metamagic feats she knows to a prepared spell as she casts it, with the same increase in casting time (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook). However, she may also prepare a spell with any metamagic feats she knows and cast it without increasing casting time like a wizard. She cannot combine these options&#151;a spell prepared with metamagic feats cannot be further modified with another metamagic feat at the time of casting (unless she has the metamixing arcanist exploit, detailed below).</p>
			<p><b>Spellbooks: </b>An arcanist must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She can&#146;t prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for read magic (which all arcanists can prepare from memory).</p>
			<p>An arcanist begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard/sorcerer spells plus three 1st-level spells of her choice. The arcanist also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new arcanist level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new arcanist level) for her spellbook. At any time, an arcanist can also add spells found in wizards' or other arcanists' spellbooks to her own (see Arcane Magic Writings).</p>
			<p><b>Arcane Reservoir (Su): </b>An arcanist has an innate pool of magical energy that she can draw upon to fuel her arcanist exploits and enhance her spells. The arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to 3 + the arcanist&#146;s level. Each day, when preparing spells, the arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 her arcanist level. Any points she had from the previous day are lost. She can also regain these points through the consume spells class feature and some arcanist exploits. The arcane reservoir can never hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this total are lost.</p>
			<p>Points from the arcanist reservoir are used to fuel many of the arcanist&#146;s powers. In addition, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action whenever she casts an arcanist spell. If she does, she can choose to increase the caster level by 1 or increase the spell&#146;s DC by 1. She can expend no more than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.</p>
			<p><b>Arcanist Exploits: </b>By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the arcanist learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic. Some of these exploits allow her to break down various forms of magic, adding their essence to her arcane reservoir. At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the arcanist learns a new arcane exploit selected from the following list. An arcanist exploit cannot be selected more than once. Once an arcanist exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Arcanists can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;2. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume spell slots. As with her other spells, these spells are not expended when cast.</p>
			<p><b>Consume Spells (Su): </b>At 1st level, an arcanist can expend an available arcanist spell slot as a move action, making it unavailable for the rest of the day, just as if she had used it to cast a spell. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Doing this adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to the level of the spell slot consumed. She cannot consume cantrips (0 level spells) in this way. Points gained in excess of the reservoir&#146;s maximum are lost.</p>
			<p><b>Elemental Focus (Su): </b>At 1st level, the elemental master must select one element: air, earth, fire, or water. The arcanist can prepare one additional spell per day of each level she can cast, but it must have the elemental descriptor of her chosen element. In addition, any spell she prepares from the opposite elemental school (air opposes earth, fire opposes water) takes up two of her prepared spell slots. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 1st level.</p>
			<p><b>Elemental Attack (Su): </b>At 3rd level, the elemental master gains an arcanist exploit tied to her element. If she selected air, she gains the lightning lance arcanist exploit. If she selected earth, she gains the acid jet arcanist exploit. If she selected fire, she gains the flame arc arcanist exploit. If she selected water, she gains the ice missile arcanist exploit. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Powerful Exploit (Su): </b>At 9th level, an elemental master increases the damage done by her elemental attack to 1d8 points of energy damage plus 1d8 points of damage per two arcanist levels she possesses. The type of damage is determined by the elemental attack. In addition, the range for the elemental attack ability increases to 60 feet (in the case of flame arc, a 60-foot line). This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 9th level.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Elemental Attack (Su): </b>At 11th level, the elemental master gains a greater arcanist exploit tied to her element. If she selected air, she gains the dancing electricity arcanist exploit. If she selected earth, she gains the lingering acid arcanist exploit. If she selected fire, she gains the burning flame arcanist exploit. If she selected water, she gains the icy tomb arcanist exploit. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 11th level.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Exploits: </b>At 11th level and every 2 levels thereafter, an arcanist can choose one of the following greater exploits in place of an arcanist exploit.</p>
			<p><b>Elemental Movement (Su): </b>At 15th level, an elemental master gains an elemental movement. This enhancement is based on her chosen element type. Air grants a fly speed of 90 feet (average maneuverability), earth grants a burrow speed of 30 feet, fire grants a increase of 30 feet to base land speed, and water grants a swim speed of 60 feet. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 15th level.</p>
			<p><b>Magical Supremacy (Su): </b>At 20th level, the arcanist learns how to convert her arcane reservoir into spells and back again. She can cast any spell she has prepared by expending a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to 1 + the level of the spell to be cast instead of expending a spell slot. When she casts a spell in this fashion, she treats her caster level as 2 higher than normal, and the DCs of any saving throws associated with the spell increase by 2. She cannot further expend points from her arcane reservoir to enhance a spell cast in this way.</p>

Once an arcanist exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p>The secretive Tarot Society focuses its efforts on the intellectual study of the region&#146;s supernatural quirks and hidden history, and embraces the use of decks of cards to examine the world&#146;s occult mysteries. (This archetype is intended for use with a tarot card set. If you don&#146;t have access to that product, roll 1d6 to determine a drawn card&#146;s suit: 1 = hammers, 2 = keys, 3 = shields, 4 = books, 5 = stars, and 6 = crowns.)</p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some spellcasters seek the secrets of magic, pursuing the power to make the impossible possible. Others are born with magic in their blood, commanding unbelievable forces as effortlessly as they breathe. Yet still others seek to meld the science of arcane scholars with the natural might of innate casters. These arcanists seek to discover the mysterious laws of magic and through will and expertise bend those forces to their whims. Arcanists are the shapers and tinkers of the arcane world, and no magic can resist their control.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Arcanists are scholars of all things magical. They constantly seek out new forms of magic to discover how they work, and in many cases, to collect the energy of such magic for their own uses. Many arcanists are seen as reckless, more concerned with the potency of magic than the ramifications of unleashing such power.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Classes: </b>Sorcerer and wizard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>2d6 x 10 gp (average 70 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Arcanist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Arcanists are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with an arcanist&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail (see Arcane Spells and Armor).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An arcanist casts arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, presented in Chapter 10 of the Core Rulebook. An arcanist must prepare her spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, her spells are not expended when they&#146;re cast. Instead, she can cast any spell that she has prepared consuming a spell slot of the appropriate level, assuming she hasn&#146;t yet used up her spell slots per day for that level.</p>
			<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the arcanist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against an arcanist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An arcanist can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3).</p>
			<p>An arcanist may know any number of spells, but the number she can prepare each day is limited. At 1st level, she can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new arcanist level, the number of spells she can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1&#150;2. Unlike the number of spells she can cast per day, the number of spells an arcanist can prepare each day is not affected by her Intelligence score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster instead affect the number of spells an arcanist can prepare.</p>
			<p>An arcanist must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the arcanist decides what spells to prepare and refreshes her available spell slots for the day.</p>
			<p>Like a sorcerer, an arcanist can choose to apply any metamagic feats she knows to a prepared spell as she casts it, with the same increase in casting time (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook). However, she may also prepare a spell with any metamagic feats she knows and cast it without increasing casting time like a wizard. She cannot combine these options&#151;a spell prepared with metamagic feats cannot be further modified with another metamagic feat at the time of casting (unless she has the metamixing arcanist exploit, detailed below).</p>
			<p><b>Spellbooks: </b>An arcanist must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She can&#146;t prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for read magic (which all arcanists can prepare from memory).</p>
			<p>An arcanist begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard/sorcerer spells plus three 1st-level spells of her choice. The arcanist also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new arcanist level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new arcanist level) for her spellbook. At any time, an arcanist can also add spells found in wizards' or other arcanists' spellbooks to her own (see Arcane Magic Writings).</p>
			<p><b>Arcane Reservoir (Su): </b>An arcanist has an innate pool of magical energy that she can draw upon to fuel her arcanist exploits and enhance her spells. The arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to 3 + the arcanist&#146;s level. Each day, when preparing spells, the arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 her arcanist level. Any points she had from the previous day are lost. She can also regain these points through the consume spells class feature and some arcanist exploits. The arcane reservoir can never hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this total are lost.</p>
			<p>Points from the arcanist reservoir are used to fuel many of the arcanist&#146;s powers. In addition, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action whenever she casts an arcanist spell. If she does, she can choose to increase the caster level by 1 or increase the spell&#146;s DC by 1. She can expend no more than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.</p>
			<p><b>Arcanist Exploits: </b>By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the arcanist learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic. Some of these exploits allow her to break down various forms of magic, adding their essence to her arcane reservoir. At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the arcanist learns a new arcane exploit selected from the following list. An arcanist exploit cannot be selected more than once. Once an arcanist exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Arcanists can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;2. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume spell slots. As with her other spells, these spells are not expended when cast.</p>
			<p><b>Psychic Reader (Ex): </b>A Tarot student gains Psychic Sensitivity as a bonus feat and adds Diplomacy, Perception, and Sense Motive to her list of class skills. This ability replaces the 1st-level arcanist exploit.</p>
			<p><b>Tarot Reservoir (Ex): </b>Once per day, a Tarot student can perform a harrow reading as a 5-minute ritual. She decides which suit most closely aligns with her task at hand and deals a nine-card spread. Each time that suit appears in her spread, she adds 1 point to her arcane reservoir, to a maximum of 1 point per 2 arcanist levels.</p>
			<p>Points gained in excess of her reservoir&#146;s maximum are lost.</p>
			<p>The Tarot student can perform this reading one additional time per day at 8th level and at 16th level.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces consume spells.</p>
			<p><b>Divine the Mysteries (Ex): </b>At 5th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a Tarot student can select a divination spell from the spell list of any class, including classes that cast divine or psychic spells and add it to her list of spells known. This spell must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell she can cast. She casts these spells as arcane spells, using her normal spell slots, but must use a harrow deck as an additional focus component.</p>
			<p>If such a spell is normally a psychic spell with an emotion or thought component, she must also add that component.</p>
			<p><b>Trump Card (Su): </b>At 9th level, a Tarot student can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir and draw a card from her harrow deck as a standard action to learn her own fate or that of an ally within 30 feet. The target&#146;s fate depends on the suit of the card drawn from the deck.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Books: </i>The target gains a +2 insight bonus on her next caster level check.</li>
				<li><i>Crowns: </i>The target gains a +2 insight bonus on her next saving throw.</li>
				<li><i>Hammers: </i>The target gains a +4 insight bonus on the damage roll of her next successful melee attack.</li>
				<li><i>Keys: </i>The target gains a +4 insight bonus on her next initiative check.</li>
				<li><i>Shields: </i>The next time the target receives magical healing, she regains an additional number of hit points equal to the Tarot student&#146;s arcanist class level.</li>
				<li><i>Stars: </i>The target gains a +4 insight bonus on her next skill check.</li>
			</list>
			<p>A creature cannot have more than one trump card in effect at one time; drawing a new trump card for a target negates the effect of the previous trump card. A Tarot student can attempt to read the fate of an enemy within 30 feet, resulting in a penalty for that target equal to the bonus granted above, but the target is entitled to a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the Tarot student&#146;s arcanist level + her Charisma modifier) to negate the effect. This is considered a curse effect. A Tarot student can have trump cards in effect for multiple creatures at the same time.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the 9th-level arcanist exploit.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Exploits: </b>At 11th level and every 2 levels thereafter, an arcanist can choose one of the following greater exploits in place of an arcanist exploit.</p>
			<p><b>Magical Supremacy (Su): </b>At 20th level, the arcanist learns how to convert her arcane reservoir into spells and back again. She can cast any spell she has prepared by expending a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to 1 + the level of the spell to be cast instead of expending a spell slot. When she casts a spell in this fashion, she treats her caster level as 2 higher than normal, and the DCs of any saving throws associated with the spell increase by 2. She cannot further expend points from her arcane reservoir to enhance a spell cast in this way.</p>

					<p>An arcanist casts arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, presented in Chapter 10 of the Core Rulebook. An arcanist must prepare her spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, her spells are not expended when they&#146;re cast. Instead, she can cast any spell that she has prepared consuming a spell slot of the appropriate level, assuming she hasn&#146;t yet used up her spell slots per day for that level.</p>
					<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the arcanist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against an arcanist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
					<p>An arcanist can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3).</p>
					<p>An arcanist may know any number of spells, but the number she can prepare each day is limited. At 1st level, she can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new arcanist level, the number of spells she can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1&#150;2. Unlike the number of spells she can cast per day, the number of spells an arcanist can prepare each day is not affected by her Intelligence score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster instead affect the number of spells an arcanist can prepare.</p>
					<p>An arcanist must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the arcanist decides what spells to prepare and refreshes her available spell slots for the day.</p>
					<p>Like a sorcerer, an arcanist can choose to apply any metamagic feats she knows to a prepared spell as she casts it, with the same increase in casting time (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook). However, she may also prepare a spell with any metamagic feats she knows and cast it without increasing casting time like a wizard. She cannot combine these options&#151;a spell prepared with metamagic feats cannot be further modified with another metamagic feat at the time of casting (unless she has the metamixing arcanist exploit, detailed below).</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 5th level, a Collegiate initiate gains Spell Mastery as a bonus feat. Her arcanist levels count as wizard levels for the purpose of satisfying feat prerequisites, both when selecting this bonus feat and when selecting feats gained from character advancement. If she uses her arcanist level to satisfy the prerequisites for Spell Mastery, she can prepare spells selected with this feat as arcanist spells without referring to a spellbook, but not as wizard spells. The Collegiate initiate can also select Spell Mastery as a feat gained from character advancement, allowing her to select the feat multiple times.</p>
					<p>In addition, if the Collegiate initiate gains levels in the collegiate arcanist prestige class, her prestige class levels stack with her arcanist levels when determining the number of points in her arcane reservoir (though not the effectiveness of arcane exploits based on class level). A Collegiate initiate who takes levels in collegiate arcanist and gains the spontaneous spell Mastery class feature can use that ability to instantly lose one of her prepared spells and immediately prepare a different arcanist spell of the same level or lower that she has mastered with Spell Mastery, rather than spontaneous spell mastery&#146;s normal effect. She is still limited to the same number of times per day she can use spontaneous spell mastery.</p>
					<p>This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 5th level.</p>

Each day, when preparing spells, the arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 her arcanist level. Any points she had from the previous day are lost. She can also regain these points through the consume spells class feature and some arcanist exploits.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Aspiring students of the Magaambya often spend decades researching arcane magic while learning to follow in the footsteps of the academy&#146;s founder, Old-Mage Jatembe. Those particularly gifted in the art of sculpting spells are sometimes schooled privately in the art of traditional, esoteric, and righteous spells, in the hope that such knowledge will pave the way for the initiate&#146;s acceptance into the school proper as a Magaambyan arcanist.</i></p>
			<p><i>But many initiates find themselves overwhelmed by the extensive training and end up leaving the Magaambya before completing their studies. These spellcasters retain many of the Magaambya&#146;s techniques and philosophical bents, but are not considered to be graduates of the school. Yet they are still respected and valued, for the Magaambya&#146;s staff fully understand that its teachings and the scholastic, often hermetic lifestyle required to master the techniques are not to everyone&#146;s tastes. For the teachers of the Magaambya, there are no truly failed students save those who abandon their philosophy and succumb to the lure of cruelty and evil.</i></p>
			<p><i>Because they hold the Magaambya&#146;s interests close to their hearts but are not hindered by the need to remain close at hand to study or serve as teachers or assistants, Magaambyan initiates often serve as strong supporters beyond the normal reach of the Magaambya. Furthermore, Magaambyan initiates can act immediately against the forces of evil without waiting to be officially sent out into the world.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some spellcasters seek the secrets of magic, pursuing the power to make the impossible possible. Others are born with magic in their blood, commanding unbelievable forces as effortlessly as they breathe. Yet still others seek to meld the science of arcane scholars with the natural might of innate casters. These arcanists seek to discover the mysterious laws of magic and through will and expertise bend those forces to their whims. Arcanists are the shapers and tinkers of the arcane world, and no magic can resist their control.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Arcanists are scholars of all things magical. They constantly seek out new forms of magic to discover how they work, and in many cases, to collect the energy of such magic for their own uses. Many arcanists are seen as reckless, more concerned with the potency of magic than the ramifications of unleashing such power.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any good.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Classes: </b>Sorcerer and wizard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>2d6 x 10 gp (average 70 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Arcanist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the arcanist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against an arcanist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An arcanist can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3).</p>
			<p>An arcanist may know any number of spells, but the number she can prepare each day is limited. At 1st level, she can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new arcanist level, the number of spells she can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1&#150;2. Unlike the number of spells she can cast per day, the number of spells an arcanist can prepare each day is not affected by her Intelligence score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster instead affect the number of spells an arcanist can prepare.</p>
			<p>An arcanist must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the arcanist decides what spells to prepare and refreshes her available spell slots for the day.</p>
			<p>Like a sorcerer, an arcanist can choose to apply any metamagic feats she knows to a prepared spell as she casts it, with the same increase in casting time (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook). However, she may also prepare a spell with any metamagic feats she knows and cast it without increasing casting time like a wizard. She cannot combine these options&#151;a spell prepared with metamagic feats cannot be further modified with another metamagic feat at the time of casting (unless she has the metamixing arcanist exploit, detailed below).</p>
			<p><b>Spellbooks: </b>An arcanist must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She can&#146;t prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for read magic (which all arcanists can prepare from memory).</p>
			<p>An arcanist begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard/sorcerer spells plus three 1st-level spells of her choice. The arcanist also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new arcanist level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new arcanist level) for her spellbook. At any time, an arcanist can also add spells found in wizards' or other arcanists' spellbooks to her own (see Arcane Magic Writings).</p>
			<p><b>Arcane Reservoir (Su): </b>An arcanist has an innate pool of magical energy that she can draw upon to fuel her arcanist exploits and enhance her spells. The arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to 3 + the arcanist&#146;s level. Each day, when preparing spells, the arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 her arcanist level. Any points she had from the previous day are lost. She can also regain these points through the consume spells class feature and some arcanist exploits. The arcane reservoir can never hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this total are lost.</p>
			<p>Points from the arcanist reservoir are used to fuel many of the arcanist&#146;s powers. In addition, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action whenever she casts an arcanist spell. If she does, she can choose to increase the caster level by 1 or increase the spell&#146;s DC by 1. She can expend no more than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.</p>
			<p><b>Arcanist Exploits: </b>By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the arcanist learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic. Some of these exploits allow her to break down various forms of magic, adding their essence to her arcane reservoir. At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the arcanist learns a new arcane exploit selected from the following list. An arcanist exploit cannot be selected more than once. Once an arcanist exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Good (Ex): </b>A collegiate arcanist radiates an aura of good as if she were a cleric of a level equal to her class level (see the detect good spell).</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Arcanists can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;2. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume spell slots. As with her other spells, these spells are not expended when cast.</p>
			<p><b>Consume Spells (Su): </b>At 1st level, an arcanist can expend an available arcanist spell slot as a move action, making it unavailable for the rest of the day, just as if she had used it to cast a spell. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Doing this adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to the level of the spell slot consumed. She cannot consume cantrips (0 level spells) in this way. Points gained in excess of the reservoir&#146;s maximum are lost.</p>
			<p><b>Halcyon Spell Lore (Su): </b>At each class level, she chooses one spell from the druid spell list or one spell with the good descriptor from the cleric spell list. The spell must be of a spell level that she can cast, and cannot be a spell that already appears on her arcanist spell list. A Collegiate initiate can cast a spell that she has chosen with this ability as if it were on her spell list and prepared by expending a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to half the spell&#146;s level (minimum 1) and expending a spell slot of the spell&#146;s level. At 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a Collegiate initiate can choose to lose a spell that she has chosen with this ability in exchange for a new spell of the same spell level that meets the same requirements.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the arcanist exploits gained at 1st, 9th, and 17th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Spell Mastery: </b>At 5th level, a Collegiate initiate gains Spell Mastery as a bonus feat. Her arcanist levels count as wizard levels for the purpose of satisfying feat prerequisites, both when selecting this bonus feat and when selecting feats gained from character advancement. If she uses her arcanist level to satisfy the prerequisites for Spell Mastery, she can prepare spells selected with this feat as arcanist spells without referring to a spellbook, but not as wizard spells. The Collegiate initiate can also select Spell Mastery as a feat gained from character advancement, allowing her to select the feat multiple times.</p>
			<p>In addition, if the Collegiate initiate gains levels in the collegiate arcanist prestige class, her prestige class levels stack with her arcanist levels when determining the number of points in her arcane reservoir (though not the effectiveness of arcane exploits based on class level). A Collegiate initiate who takes levels in collegiate arcanist and gains the spontaneous spell Mastery class feature can use that ability to instantly lose one of her prepared spells and immediately prepare a different arcanist spell of the same level or lower that she has mastered with Spell Mastery, rather than spontaneous spell mastery&#146;s normal effect. She is still limited to the same number of times per day she can use spontaneous spell mastery.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 5th level.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Exploits: </b>At 11th level and every 2 levels thereafter, an arcanist can choose one of the following greater exploits in place of an arcanist exploit.</p>
			<p><b>Magical Supremacy (Su): </b>At 20th level, the arcanist learns how to convert her arcane reservoir into spells and back again. She can cast any spell she has prepared by expending a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to 1 + the level of the spell to be cast instead of expending a spell slot. When she casts a spell in this fashion, she treats her caster level as 2 higher than normal, and the DCs of any saving throws associated with the spell increase by 2. She cannot further expend points from her arcane reservoir to enhance a spell cast in this way.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p>Not all arcanists peer inward to discern the deepest secrets of magic. Some look outward, connecting with extraplanar creatures and bartering for secrets, power, and favor.</p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some spellcasters seek the secrets of magic, pursuing the power to make the impossible possible. Others are born with magic in their blood, commanding unbelievable forces as effortlessly as they breathe. Yet still others seek to meld the science of arcane scholars with the natural might of innate casters. These arcanists seek to discover the mysterious laws of magic and through will and expertise bend those forces to their whims. Arcanists are the shapers and tinkers of the arcane world, and no magic can resist their control.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Arcanists are scholars of all things magical. They constantly seek out new forms of magic to discover how they work, and in many cases, to collect the energy of such magic for their own uses. Many arcanists are seen as reckless, more concerned with the potency of magic than the ramifications of unleashing such power.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Classes: </b>Sorcerer and wizard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>2d6 x 10 gp (average 70 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Arcanist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Arcanists are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with an arcanist&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail (see Arcane Spells and Armor).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An arcanist casts arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, presented in Chapter 10 of the Core Rulebook. An arcanist must prepare her spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, her spells are not expended when they&#146;re cast. Instead, she can cast any spell that she has prepared consuming a spell slot of the appropriate level, assuming she hasn&#146;t yet used up her spell slots per day for that level.</p>
			<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the arcanist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against an arcanist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An arcanist can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3).</p>
			<p>An arcanist may know any number of spells, but the number she can prepare each day is limited. At 1st level, she can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new arcanist level, the number of spells she can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1&#150;2. Unlike the number of spells she can cast per day, the number of spells an arcanist can prepare each day is not affected by her Intelligence score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster instead affect the number of spells an arcanist can prepare.</p>
			<p>An arcanist must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the arcanist decides what spells to prepare and refreshes her available spell slots for the day.</p>
			<p>Like a sorcerer, an arcanist can choose to apply any metamagic feats she knows to a prepared spell as she casts it, with the same increase in casting time (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook). However, she may also prepare a spell with any metamagic feats she knows and cast it without increasing casting time like a wizard. She cannot combine these options&#151;a spell prepared with metamagic feats cannot be further modified with another metamagic feat at the time of casting (unless she has the metamixing arcanist exploit, detailed below).</p>
			<p><b>Spellbooks: </b>An arcanist must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She can&#146;t prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for read magic (which all arcanists can prepare from memory).</p>
			<p>An arcanist begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard/sorcerer spells plus three 1st-level spells of her choice. The arcanist also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new arcanist level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new arcanist level) for her spellbook. At any time, an arcanist can also add spells found in wizards' or other arcanists' spellbooks to her own (see Arcane Magic Writings).</p>
			<p><b>Arcane Reservoir (Su): </b>An arcanist has an innate pool of magical energy that she can draw upon to fuel her arcanist exploits and enhance her spells. The arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to 3 + the arcanist&#146;s level. Each day, when preparing spells, the arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 her arcanist level. Any points she had from the previous day are lost. She can also regain these points through the consume spells class feature and some arcanist exploits. The arcane reservoir can never hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this total are lost.</p>
			<p>Points from the arcanist reservoir are used to fuel many of the arcanist&#146;s powers. In addition, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action whenever she casts an arcanist spell. If she does, she can choose to increase the caster level by 1 or increase the spell&#146;s DC by 1. She can expend no more than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.</p>
			<p><b>Arcanist Exploits: </b>By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the arcanist learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic. Some of these exploits allow her to break down various forms of magic, adding their essence to her arcane reservoir. At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the arcanist learns a new arcane exploit selected from the following list. An arcanist exploit cannot be selected more than once. Once an arcanist exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Arcanists can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;2. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume spell slots. As with her other spells, these spells are not expended when cast.</p>
			<p><b>Conjurer&#146;s Focus (Sp): </b>An occultist can spend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to cast summon monster I. She can cast this spell as a standard action and the summoned creatures remain for 1 minute per level (instead of 1 round per level). At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the power of this ability increases by one spell level, allowing her to summon more powerful creatures (to a maximum of summon monster IX at 17th level), at the cost of an additional point from her arcane spell reserve per spell level. An occultist cannot have more than one summon monster spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon monster immediately ends. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 1st level.</p>
			<p><b>Consume Spells (Su): </b>At 1st level, an arcanist can expend an available arcanist spell slot as a move action, making it unavailable for the rest of the day, just as if she had used it to cast a spell. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Doing this adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to the level of the spell slot consumed. She cannot consume cantrips (0 level spells) in this way. Points gained in excess of the reservoir&#146;s maximum are lost.</p>
			<p><b>Planar Spells: </b>An occultist adds all planar ally spells to her spell list (using her arcanist level as the cleric level), and treats plane shift as a 5th-level arcanist spell.</p>
			<p><b>Planar Contact (Sp): </b>At 7th level, an occultist can cast augury once per day and contact other plane once per week, using her arcanist level as her caster level. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 7th level.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Exploits: </b>At 11th level and every 2 levels thereafter, an arcanist can choose one of the following greater exploits in place of an arcanist exploit.</p>
			<p><b>Perfect Summoner: </b>At 20th level, an occultist can use her conjurer&#146;s focus without spending points from her arcane reservoir, and the creatures summoned last until dismissed. This ability replaces magical supremacy.</p>

She can also further specialize by selecting a subschool. In addition, the arcanist can prepare one additional spell per day of each level she can cast, but this spell must be chosen from the selected school.</p>
					<p>Finally, the arcanist must select two additional schools of magic as her opposition schools. Whenever she prepares spells from one of her opposition schools, the spell takes up two of her prepared spell slots. In addition, a school savant takes a &#150;4 penalty on any skill checks when crafting a magic item that has a spell from one of her opposition schools as a prerequisite. A school savant cannot select the school understanding arcanist exploit. This ability replaces the arcanist exploits gained at 1st, 3rd, and 7th levels.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p>Some arcanists specialize in a school of magic and trade flexibility for focus. School savants are able to prepare more spells per day than typical arcanists, but their selection is more limited.</p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some spellcasters seek the secrets of magic, pursuing the power to make the impossible possible. Others are born with magic in their blood, commanding unbelievable forces as effortlessly as they breathe. Yet still others seek to meld the science of arcane scholars with the natural might of innate casters. These arcanists seek to discover the mysterious laws of magic and through will and expertise bend those forces to their whims. Arcanists are the shapers and tinkers of the arcane world, and no magic can resist their control.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Arcanists are scholars of all things magical. They constantly seek out new forms of magic to discover how they work, and in many cases, to collect the energy of such magic for their own uses. Many arcanists are seen as reckless, more concerned with the potency of magic than the ramifications of unleashing such power.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Classes: </b>Sorcerer and wizard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>2d6 x 10 gp (average 70 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Arcanist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Arcanists are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with an arcanist&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail (see Arcane Spells and Armor).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An arcanist casts arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, presented in Chapter 10 of the Core Rulebook. An arcanist must prepare her spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, her spells are not expended when they&#146;re cast. Instead, she can cast any spell that she has prepared consuming a spell slot of the appropriate level, assuming she hasn&#146;t yet used up her spell slots per day for that level.</p>
			<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the arcanist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against an arcanist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An arcanist can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3).</p>
			<p>An arcanist may know any number of spells, but the number she can prepare each day is limited. At 1st level, she can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new arcanist level, the number of spells she can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1&#150;2. Unlike the number of spells she can cast per day, the number of spells an arcanist can prepare each day is not affected by her Intelligence score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster instead affect the number of spells an arcanist can prepare.</p>
			<p>An arcanist must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the arcanist decides what spells to prepare and refreshes her available spell slots for the day.</p>
			<p>Like a sorcerer, an arcanist can choose to apply any metamagic feats she knows to a prepared spell as she casts it, with the same increase in casting time (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook). However, she may also prepare a spell with any metamagic feats she knows and cast it without increasing casting time like a wizard. She cannot combine these options&#151;a spell prepared with metamagic feats cannot be further modified with another metamagic feat at the time of casting (unless she has the metamixing arcanist exploit, detailed below).</p>
			<p><b>Spellbooks: </b>An arcanist must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She can&#146;t prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for read magic (which all arcanists can prepare from memory).</p>
			<p>An arcanist begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard/sorcerer spells plus three 1st-level spells of her choice. The arcanist also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new arcanist level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new arcanist level) for her spellbook. At any time, an arcanist can also add spells found in wizards' or other arcanists' spellbooks to her own (see Arcane Magic Writings).</p>
			<p><b>Arcane Reservoir (Su): </b>An arcanist has an innate pool of magical energy that she can draw upon to fuel her arcanist exploits and enhance her spells. The arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to 3 + the arcanist&#146;s level. Each day, when preparing spells, the arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 her arcanist level. Any points she had from the previous day are lost. She can also regain these points through the consume spells class feature and some arcanist exploits. The arcane reservoir can never hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this total are lost.</p>
			<p>Points from the arcanist reservoir are used to fuel many of the arcanist&#146;s powers. In addition, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action whenever she casts an arcanist spell. If she does, she can choose to increase the caster level by 1 or increase the spell&#146;s DC by 1. She can expend no more than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.</p>
			<p><b>Arcanist Exploits: </b>By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the arcanist learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic. Some of these exploits allow her to break down various forms of magic, adding their essence to her arcane reservoir. At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the arcanist learns a new arcane exploit selected from the following list. An arcanist exploit cannot be selected more than once. Once an arcanist exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Arcanists can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;2. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume spell slots. As with her other spells, these spells are not expended when cast.</p>
			<p><b>Consume Spells (Su): </b>At 1st level, an arcanist can expend an available arcanist spell slot as a move action, making it unavailable for the rest of the day, just as if she had used it to cast a spell. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Doing this adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to the level of the spell slot consumed. She cannot consume cantrips (0 level spells) in this way. Points gained in excess of the reservoir&#146;s maximum are lost.</p>
			<p><b>School Focus (Su): </b>At 1st level, a school savant chooses a school of magic. The arcanist gains the abilities granted by that school, as the arcane school class feature of the wizard, treating her arcanist level as her wizard level for these abilities. She can also further specialize by selecting a subschool. In addition, the arcanist can prepare one additional spell per day of each level she can cast, but this spell must be chosen from the selected school.</p>
			<p>Finally, the arcanist must select two additional schools of magic as her opposition schools. Whenever she prepares spells from one of her opposition schools, the spell takes up two of her prepared spell slots. In addition, a school savant takes a &#150;4 penalty on any skill checks when crafting a magic item that has a spell from one of her opposition schools as a prerequisite. A school savant cannot select the school understanding arcanist exploit. This ability replaces the arcanist exploits gained at 1st, 3rd, and 7th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Exploits: </b>At 11th level and every 2 levels thereafter, an arcanist can choose one of the following greater exploits in place of an arcanist exploit.</p>
			<p><b>Magical Supremacy (Su): </b>At 20th level, the arcanist learns how to convert her arcane reservoir into spells and back again. She can cast any spell she has prepared by expending a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to 1 + the level of the spell to be cast instead of expending a spell slot. When she casts a spell in this fashion, she treats her caster level as 2 higher than normal, and the DCs of any saving throws associated with the spell increase by 2. She cannot further expend points from her arcane reservoir to enhance a spell cast in this way.</p>

					<p>By wresting a soul from life to death, a twilight sage gains a slightly deeper understanding of mortality, fueling her curiosity and eldritch power. As a full-round action, she can consume the life energy of a helpless living creature, killing it. This creature must have 2 or more Hit Dice and be below 0 hit points. The twilight sage adds 2 points to her arcane reservoir if the creature&#146;s Hit Dice equaled or exceeded the sage&#146;s character level, or 1 point if the creature&#146;s Hit Dice equaled at least 1/2 her character level.

					<p>A twilight sage&#146;s arcane barrier differs from those of other arcanists, as it draws upon both negative and positive energy to protect the sage. At 1st level, a twilight sage must choose the arcane barrier exploit as her first arcanist exploit. Whenever an attack removes the last temporary hit point from the twilight sage&#146;s arcane barrier, the barrier&#146;s negative energy lashes back at the attacker, dealing an amount of negative energy damage equal to the barrier&#146;s maximum temporary hit point capacity. This ability alters the arcanist exploit gained at 1st level.</p>

Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>

				<name type="string">Twilight Transfer (Su)</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 11th level, a twilight sage&#146;s mastery over life and death allows her to transfer life energy into a fading vessel. Once per day, she can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir while touching a creature that died within the past round to affect that creature as if it had received a breath of life spell, using her arcanist level as the caster level. At the same time, a willing or unconscious living creature within 300 feet that has a number of Hit Dice equal to or greater than the recipient&#146;s instantly dies. This ability is a death effect, and if the victim doesn&#146;t actually die (such as if it was summoned or is immune to death effects), the recipient doesn&#146;t receive the breath of life effect. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 11th level.</p>

					<p>At 20th level, a twilight sage has mastered the relationship between death and arcane power, and has gained a limited ability to surpass her own mortality. Whenever she dies (but not if she becomes undead), if she still has points in her arcane reservoir she appears as an ephemeral spirit in the air above her corpse. She can still cast spells in this form, using her corpse as the origin point and determining whether she can see or target any creature or area as though she were alive in that square. To cast a spell, she must expend a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to 1 + the spell&#146;s level. The spirit disappears if she has no points remaining in her arcane reservoir or she spends a round without casting a spell. The spirit can&#146;t move, deliver touch or ranged touch spells, or do anything that isn&#146;t part of casting a spell. Her spirit completes the verbal and somatic components of her spells, any material components are consumed from the supply on the corpse, and any focus components must be on the corpse. This ability replaces magical supremacy.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p>The twilight sages of Geb carry out experiments to solve the ultimate puzzle and unlock the secrets of life and death. While the twilight sages generally aren&#146;t actively malicious, most are willing to perform human experimentation in pursuit of knowledge with little regard for the casualties.</p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some spellcasters seek the secrets of magic, pursuing the power to make the impossible possible. Others are born with magic in their blood, commanding unbelievable forces as effortlessly as they breathe. Yet still others seek to meld the science of arcane scholars with the natural might of innate casters. These arcanists seek to discover the mysterious laws of magic and through will and expertise bend those forces to their whims. Arcanists are the shapers and tinkers of the arcane world, and no magic can resist their control.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Arcanists are scholars of all things magical. They constantly seek out new forms of magic to discover how they work, and in many cases, to collect the energy of such magic for their own uses. Many arcanists are seen as reckless, more concerned with the potency of magic than the ramifications of unleashing such power.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Classes: </b>Sorcerer and wizard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>2d6 x 10 gp (average 70 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Arcanist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Arcanists are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with an arcanist&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail (see Arcane Spells and Armor).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An arcanist casts arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, presented in Chapter 10 of the Core Rulebook. An arcanist must prepare her spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, her spells are not expended when they&#146;re cast. Instead, she can cast any spell that she has prepared consuming a spell slot of the appropriate level, assuming she hasn&#146;t yet used up her spell slots per day for that level.</p>
			<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the arcanist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against an arcanist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An arcanist can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3).</p>
			<p>An arcanist may know any number of spells, but the number she can prepare each day is limited. At 1st level, she can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new arcanist level, the number of spells she can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1&#150;2. Unlike the number of spells she can cast per day, the number of spells an arcanist can prepare each day is not affected by her Intelligence score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster instead affect the number of spells an arcanist can prepare.</p>
			<p>An arcanist must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the arcanist decides what spells to prepare and refreshes her available spell slots for the day.</p>
			<p>Like a sorcerer, an arcanist can choose to apply any metamagic feats she knows to a prepared spell as she casts it, with the same increase in casting time (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook). However, she may also prepare a spell with any metamagic feats she knows and cast it without increasing casting time like a wizard. She cannot combine these options&#151;a spell prepared with metamagic feats cannot be further modified with another metamagic feat at the time of casting (unless she has the metamixing arcanist exploit, detailed below).</p>
			<p><b>Spellbooks: </b>An arcanist must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She can&#146;t prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for read magic (which all arcanists can prepare from memory).</p>
			<p>An arcanist begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard/sorcerer spells plus three 1st-level spells of her choice. The arcanist also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new arcanist level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new arcanist level) for her spellbook. At any time, an arcanist can also add spells found in wizards' or other arcanists' spellbooks to her own (see Arcane Magic Writings).</p>
			<p><b>Arcane Reservoir (Su): </b>An arcanist has an innate pool of magical energy that she can draw upon to fuel her arcanist exploits and enhance her spells. The arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to 3 + the arcanist&#146;s level. Each day, when preparing spells, the arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 her arcanist level. Any points she had from the previous day are lost. She can also regain these points through the consume spells class feature and some arcanist exploits. The arcane reservoir can never hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this total are lost.</p>
			<p>Points from the arcanist reservoir are used to fuel many of the arcanist&#146;s powers. In addition, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action whenever she casts an arcanist spell. If she does, she can choose to increase the caster level by 1 or increase the spell&#146;s DC by 1. She can expend no more than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.</p>
			<p><b>Arcanist Exploits: </b>By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the arcanist learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic. Some of these exploits allow her to break down various forms of magic, adding their essence to her arcane reservoir. At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the arcanist learns a new arcane exploit selected from the following list. An arcanist exploit cannot be selected more than once. Once an arcanist exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Arcanists can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;2. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume spell slots. As with her other spells, these spells are not expended when cast.</p>
			<p><b>Consume Life (Su): </b>By wresting a soul from life to death, a twilight sage gains a slightly deeper understanding of mortality, fueling her curiosity and eldritch power. As a full-round action, she can consume the life energy of a helpless living creature, killing it. This creature must have 2 or more Hit Dice and be below 0 hit points. The twilight sage adds 2 points to her arcane reservoir if the creature&#146;s Hit Dice equaled or exceeded the sage&#146;s character level, or 1 point if the creature&#146;s Hit Dice equaled at least 1/2 her character level. This ability is a death effect. This ability replaces consume spells.</p>
			<p><b>Necromantic Focus (Ex): </b>Twilight sages consider their research into life and death to be paramount, beyond all other concerns. Each day, a twilight sage must prepare at least one necromancy spell of each spell level she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Twilight Barrier (Ex): </b>A twilight sage&#146;s arcane barrier differs from those of other arcanists, as it draws upon both negative and positive energy to protect the sage. At 1st level, a twilight sage must choose the arcane barrier exploit as her first arcanist exploit. Whenever an attack removes the last temporary hit point from the twilight sage&#146;s arcane barrier, the barrier&#146;s negative energy lashes back at the attacker, dealing an amount of negative energy damage equal to the barrier&#146;s maximum temporary hit point capacity. This ability alters the arcanist exploit gained at 1st level.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Exploits: </b>At 11th level and every 2 levels thereafter, an arcanist can choose one of the following greater exploits in place of an arcanist exploit.</p>
			<p><b>Magical Supremacy (Su): </b>At 20th level, the arcanist learns how to convert her arcane reservoir into spells and back again. She can cast any spell she has prepared by expending a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to 1 + the level of the spell to be cast instead of expending a spell slot. When she casts a spell in this fashion, she treats her caster level as 2 higher than normal, and the DCs of any saving throws associated with the spell increase by 2. She cannot further expend points from her arcane reservoir to enhance a spell cast in this way.</p>

					<p>At 1st level, an arcanist can expend an available arcanist spell slot as a move action, making it unavailable for the rest of the day, just as if she had used it to cast a spell.

Doing this adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to the level of the spell slot consumed. She cannot consume cantrips (0 level spells) in this way.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p>Some arcanists store their spells as whispered secrets within familiars instead of on paper.</p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some spellcasters seek the secrets of magic, pursuing the power to make the impossible possible. Others are born with magic in their blood, commanding unbelievable forces as effortlessly as they breathe. Yet still others seek to meld the science of arcane scholars with the natural might of innate casters. These arcanists seek to discover the mysterious laws of magic and through will and expertise bend those forces to their whims. Arcanists are the shapers and tinkers of the arcane world, and no magic can resist their control.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Arcanists are scholars of all things magical. They constantly seek out new forms of magic to discover how they work, and in many cases, to collect the energy of such magic for their own uses. Many arcanists are seen as reckless, more concerned with the potency of magic than the ramifications of unleashing such power.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Classes: </b>Sorcerer and wizard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>2d6 x 10 gp (average 70 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Arcanist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Arcanists are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with an arcanist&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail (see Arcane Spells and Armor).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An arcanist casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list, presented in Chapter 10 of the Core Rulebook. An arcanist must prepare her spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, her spells are not expended when they&#146;re cast. Instead, she can cast any spell that she has prepared consuming a spell slot of the appropriate level, assuming she hasn&#146;t yet used up her spell slots per day for that level.</p>
			<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the arcanist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against an arcanist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An arcanist can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3).</p>
			<p>An arcanist may know any number of spells, but the number she can prepare each day is limited. At 1st level, she can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new arcanist level, the number of spells she can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1&#150;2. Unlike the number of spells she can cast per day, the number of spells an arcanist can prepare each day is not affected by her Intelligence score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster instead affect the number of spells an arcanist can prepare.</p>
			<p>An arcanist must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the arcanist decides what spells to prepare and refreshes her available spell slots for the day.</p>
			<p>Like a sorcerer, an arcanist can choose to apply any metamagic feats she knows to a prepared spell as she casts it, with the same increase in casting time (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook). However, she may also prepare a spell with any metamagic feats she knows and cast it without increasing casting time like a wizard. She cannot combine these options&#151;a spell prepared with metamagic feats cannot be further modified with another metamagic feat at the time of casting (unless she has the metamixing arcanist exploit, detailed below).</p>
			<p><b>Familiar: </b>An unlettered arcanist does not keep a spellbook. Instead, she gains a familiar in which she stores her spells as a witch does, though she does not gain a witch&#146;s patron. Treat her arcanist level as her witch level for determining the abilities and benefits granted by the familiar. Anything that would allow an unlettered arcanist to add spells to her spellbook allows her to add spells to her familiar instead. This ability replaces spellbooks.</p>
			<p><b>Arcane Reservoir (Su): </b>An arcanist has an innate pool of magical energy that she can draw upon to fuel her arcanist exploits and enhance her spells. The arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to 3 + the arcanist&#146;s level. Each day, when preparing spells, the arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 her arcanist level. Any points she had from the previous day are lost. She can also regain these points through the consume spells class feature and some arcanist exploits. The arcane reservoir can never hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this total are lost.</p>
			<p>Points from the arcanist reservoir are used to fuel many of the arcanist&#146;s powers. In addition, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action whenever she casts an arcanist spell. If she does, she can choose to increase the caster level by 1 or increase the spell&#146;s DC by 1. She can expend no more than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.</p>
			<p><b>Arcanist Exploits: </b>By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the arcanist learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic. Some of these exploits allow her to break down various forms of magic, adding their essence to her arcane reservoir. At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the arcanist learns a new arcane exploit selected from the following list. An arcanist exploit cannot be selected more than once. Once an arcanist exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function.

			<p><b>Consume Spells (Su): </b>At 1st level, an arcanist can expend an available arcanist spell slot as a move action, making it unavailable for the rest of the day, just as if she had used it to cast a spell. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1).

			<p><b>Magical Supremacy (Su): </b>At 20th level, the arcanist learns how to convert her arcane reservoir into spells and back again. She can cast any spell she has prepared by expending a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to 1 + the level of the spell to be cast instead of expending a spell slot. When she casts a spell in this fashion, she treats her caster level as 2 higher than normal, and the DCs of any saving throws associated with the spell increase by 2. She cannot further expend points from her arcane reservoir to enhance a spell cast in this way.</p>

					<p>An arcanist casts arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, presented in Chapter 10 of the Core Rulebook. An arcanist must prepare her spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, her spells are not expended when they&#146;re cast. Instead, she can cast any spell that she has prepared consuming a spell slot of the appropriate level, assuming she hasn&#146;t yet used up her spell slots per day for that level.</p>
					<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the arcanist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against an arcanist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
					<p>An arcanist can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3).</p>
					<p>An arcanist may know any number of spells, but the number she can prepare each day is limited. At 1st level, she can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new arcanist level, the number of spells she can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1&#150;2. Unlike the number of spells she can cast per day, the number of spells an arcanist can prepare each day is not affected by her Intelligence score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster instead affect the number of spells an arcanist can prepare.</p>
					<p>An arcanist must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the arcanist decides what spells to prepare and refreshes her available spell slots for the day.</p>
					<p>Like a sorcerer, an arcanist can choose to apply any metamagic feats she knows to a prepared spell as she casts it, with the same increase in casting time (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook). However, she may also prepare a spell with any metamagic feats she knows and cast it without increasing casting time like a wizard. She cannot combine these options&#151;a spell prepared with metamagic feats cannot be further modified with another metamagic feat at the time of casting (unless she has the metamixing arcanist exploit, detailed below).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p>A white mage is an arcanist touched by a divine power and gifted with the ability to heal others.</p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some spellcasters seek the secrets of magic, pursuing the power to make the impossible possible. Others are born with magic in their blood, commanding unbelievable forces as effortlessly as they breathe. Yet still others seek to meld the science of arcane scholars with the natural might of innate casters. These arcanists seek to discover the mysterious laws of magic and through will and expertise bend those forces to their whims. Arcanists are the shapers and tinkers of the arcane world, and no magic can resist their control.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Arcanists are scholars of all things magical. They constantly seek out new forms of magic to discover how they work, and in many cases, to collect the energy of such magic for their own uses. Many arcanists are seen as reckless, more concerned with the potency of magic than the ramifications of unleashing such power.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Classes: </b>Sorcerer and wizard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>2d6 x 10 gp (average 70 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Arcanist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p>An arcanist can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3).</p>
			<p>An arcanist may know any number of spells, but the number she can prepare each day is limited. At 1st level, she can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new arcanist level, the number of spells she can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1&#150;2. Unlike the number of spells she can cast per day, the number of spells an arcanist can prepare each day is not affected by her Intelligence score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster instead affect the number of spells an arcanist can prepare.</p>
			<p>An arcanist must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the arcanist decides what spells to prepare and refreshes her available spell slots for the day.</p>
			<p>Like a sorcerer, an arcanist can choose to apply any metamagic feats she knows to a prepared spell as she casts it, with the same increase in casting time (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook). However, she may also prepare a spell with any metamagic feats she knows and cast it without increasing casting time like a wizard. She cannot combine these options&#151;a spell prepared with metamagic feats cannot be further modified with another metamagic feat at the time of casting (unless she has the metamixing arcanist exploit, detailed below).</p>
			<p><b>Spellbooks: </b>An arcanist must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She can&#146;t prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for read magic (which all arcanists can prepare from memory).</p>
			<p>An arcanist begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard/sorcerer spells plus three 1st-level spells of her choice. The arcanist also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new arcanist level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new arcanist level) for her spellbook. At any time, an arcanist can also add spells found in wizards' or other arcanists' spellbooks to her own (see Arcane Magic Writings).</p>
			<p><b>Arcane Reservoir (Su): </b>An arcanist has an innate pool of magical energy that she can draw upon to fuel her arcanist exploits and enhance her spells. The arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to 3 + the arcanist&#146;s level. Each day, when preparing spells, the arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 her arcanist level. Any points she had from the previous day are lost. She can also regain these points through the consume spells class feature and some arcanist exploits. The arcane reservoir can never hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this total are lost.</p>
			<p>Points from the arcanist reservoir are used to fuel many of the arcanist&#146;s powers. In addition, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action whenever she casts an arcanist spell. If she does, she can choose to increase the caster level by 1 or increase the spell&#146;s DC by 1. She can expend no more than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.</p>
			<p><b>Arcanist Exploits: </b>By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the arcanist learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic. Some of these exploits allow her to break down various forms of magic, adding their essence to her arcane reservoir. At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the arcanist learns a new arcane exploit selected from the following list. An arcanist exploit cannot be selected more than once. Once an arcanist exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Arcanists can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;2. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume spell slots. As with her other spells, these spells are not expended when cast.</p>
			<p><b>Consume Spells (Su): </b>At 1st level, an arcanist can expend an available arcanist spell slot as a move action, making it unavailable for the rest of the day, just as if she had used it to cast a spell. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Doing this adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to the level of the spell slot consumed. She cannot consume cantrips (0 level spells) in this way. Points gained in excess of the reservoir&#146;s maximum are lost.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Healing (Su): </b>At 1st level, a white mage can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to use one of her spell slots to cast a cure spell (any spell with &#147;cure&#148; in its name) from the cleric spell list as if it were on her spell list and prepared. The spell must be of a level the arcanist can cast. At 10th level, the white mage can expend 5 points from her arcane reservoir and a spell slot of at least 5th level to cast breath of life. This ability replaces the arcanist exploits gained at 1st and 9th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Exploits: </b>At 11th level and every 2 levels thereafter, an arcanist can choose one of the following greater exploits in place of an arcanist exploit.</p>
			<p><b>Magical Supremacy (Su): </b>At 20th level, the arcanist learns how to convert her arcane reservoir into spells and back again. She can cast any spell she has prepared by expending a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to 1 + the level of the spell to be cast instead of expending a spell slot. When she casts a spell in this fashion, she treats her caster level as 2 higher than normal, and the DCs of any saving throws associated with the spell increase by 2. She cannot further expend points from her arcane reservoir to enhance a spell cast in this way.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p>-</p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some spellcasters seek the secrets of magic, pursuing the power to make the impossible possible. Others are born with magic in their blood, commanding unbelievable forces as effortlessly as they breathe. Yet still others seek to meld the science of arcane scholars with the natural might of innate casters. These arcanists seek to discover the mysterious laws of magic and through will and expertise bend those forces to their whims. Arcanists are the shapers and tinkers of the arcane world, and no magic can resist their control.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Arcanists are scholars of all things magical. They constantly seek out new forms of magic to discover how they work, and in many cases, to collect the energy of such magic for their own uses. Many arcanists are seen as reckless, more concerned with the potency of magic than the ramifications of unleashing such power.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Classes: </b>Sorcerer and wizard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>2d6 x 10 gp (average 70 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Arcanist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Arcanists are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with an arcanist&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail (see Arcane Spells and Armor).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An arcanist casts arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, presented in Chapter 10 of the Core Rulebook. An arcanist must prepare her spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, her spells are not expended when they&#146;re cast. Instead, she can cast any spell that she has prepared consuming a spell slot of the appropriate level, assuming she hasn&#146;t yet used up her spell slots per day for that level.</p>
			<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the arcanist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against an arcanist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An arcanist can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3).</p>
			<p>An arcanist may know any number of spells, but the number she can prepare each day is limited. At 1st level, she can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new arcanist level, the number of spells she can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1&#150;2. Unlike the number of spells she can cast per day, the number of spells an arcanist can prepare each day is not affected by her Intelligence score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster instead affect the number of spells an arcanist can prepare.</p>
			<p>An arcanist must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the arcanist decides what spells to prepare and refreshes her available spell slots for the day.</p>
			<p>Like a sorcerer, an arcanist can choose to apply any metamagic feats she knows to a prepared spell as she casts it, with the same increase in casting time (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook). However, she may also prepare a spell with any metamagic feats she knows and cast it without increasing casting time like a wizard. She cannot combine these options&#151;a spell prepared with metamagic feats cannot be further modified with another metamagic feat at the time of casting (unless she has the metamixing arcanist exploit, detailed below).</p>
			<p><b>Spellbooks: </b>An arcanist must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She can&#146;t prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for read magic (which all arcanists can prepare from memory).</p>
			<p>An arcanist begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard/sorcerer spells plus three 1st-level spells of her choice. The arcanist also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new arcanist level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new arcanist level) for her spellbook. At any time, an arcanist can also add spells found in wizards' or other arcanists' spellbooks to her own (see Arcane Magic Writings).</p>
			<p><b>Arcane Reservoir (Su): </b>An arcanist has an innate pool of magical energy that she can draw upon to fuel her arcanist exploits and enhance her spells. The arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to 3 + the arcanist&#146;s level. Each day, when preparing spells, the arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 her arcanist level. Any points she had from the previous day are lost. She can also regain these points through the consume spells class feature and some arcanist exploits. The arcane reservoir can never hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this total are lost.</p>
			<p>Points from the arcanist reservoir are used to fuel many of the arcanist&#146;s powers. In addition, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action whenever she casts an arcanist spell. If she does, she can choose to increase the caster level by 1 or increase the spell&#146;s DC by 1. She can expend no more than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.</p>
			<p><b>Arcanist Exploits: </b>By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the arcanist learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic. Some of these exploits allow her to break down various forms of magic, adding their essence to her arcane reservoir. At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the arcanist learns a new arcane exploit selected from the following list. An arcanist exploit cannot be selected more than once. Once an arcanist exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Arcanists can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;2. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume spell slots. As with her other spells, these spells are not expended when cast.</p>
			<p><b>Consume Spells (Su): </b>At 1st level, an arcanist can expend an available arcanist spell slot as a move action, making it unavailable for the rest of the day, just as if she had used it to cast a spell. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Doing this adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to the level of the spell slot consumed. She cannot consume cantrips (0 level spells) in this way. Points gained in excess of the reservoir&#146;s maximum are lost.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Exploits: </b>At 11th level and every 2 levels thereafter, an arcanist can choose one of the following greater exploits in place of an arcanist exploit.</p>
			<p><b>Magical Supremacy (Su): </b>At 20th level, the arcanist learns how to convert her arcane reservoir into spells and back again. She can cast any spell she has prepared by expending a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to 1 + the level of the spell to be cast instead of expending a spell slot. When she casts a spell in this fashion, she treats her caster level as 2 higher than normal, and the DCs of any saving throws associated with the spell increase by 2. She cannot further expend points from her arcane reservoir to enhance a spell cast in this way.</p>

					<p>At 5th level, an aeromancer can expend 2 points from her arcane reservoir to call upon the winds to gently carry her through the air while protecting her from harm. She is affected as though by the spell air walk and is surrounded by protective winds that function similarly to a wind wall spell, except the effect surrounds only the aeromancer and moves with her wherever she goes.

This takes the form of either a 20-foot-radius burst centered on the aeromancer or a 40-foot cone originating from the aeromancer&#146;s space. She can choose which form the wind takes each time she uses the ability. The affected area is filled with hurricane-force winds (75 mph). This makes normal ranged attacks passing through this area impossible, imposes a &#150;8 penalty on ranged attacks from siege weapons that pass through the area, and imposes a &#150;12 penalty on Fly checks attempted within the area. Additionally, Large creatures in the area are in danger of being checked, and Medium or smaller creatures in the area are in danger of being blown away.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p>The undisputed masters of wind and sky unlocked numerous secrets of air magic. The vast majority of these secrets were lost when their civilization collapsed, but a few of their magical traditions have been preserved through the years. While the practice of aeromancy is rare, some arcanists today are able to rival the aerial mastery of the ancient aeromancers.</p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some spellcasters seek the secrets of magic, pursuing the power to make the impossible possible. Others are born with magic in their blood, commanding unbelievable forces as effortlessly as they breathe. Yet still others seek to meld the science of arcane scholars with the natural might of innate casters. These arcanists seek to discover the mysterious laws of magic and through will and expertise bend those forces to their whims. Arcanists are the shapers and tinkers of the arcane world, and no magic can resist their control.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Arcanists are scholars of all things magical. They constantly seek out new forms of magic to discover how they work, and in many cases, to collect the energy of such magic for their own uses. Many arcanists are seen as reckless, more concerned with the potency of magic than the ramifications of unleashing such power.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Classes: </b>Sorcerer and wizard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>2d6 x 10 gp (average 70 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Arcanist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Arcanists are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with an arcanist&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail (see Arcane Spells and Armor).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An arcanist casts arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, presented in Chapter 10 of the Core Rulebook. An arcanist must prepare her spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, her spells are not expended when they&#146;re cast. Instead, she can cast any spell that she has prepared consuming a spell slot of the appropriate level, assuming she hasn&#146;t yet used up her spell slots per day for that level.</p>
			<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the arcanist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against an arcanist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An arcanist can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3).</p>
			<p>An arcanist may know any number of spells, but the number she can prepare each day is limited. At 1st level, she can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new arcanist level, the number of spells she can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1&#150;2. Unlike the number of spells she can cast per day, the number of spells an arcanist can prepare each day is not affected by her Intelligence score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster instead affect the number of spells an arcanist can prepare.</p>
			<p>An arcanist must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the arcanist decides what spells to prepare and refreshes her available spell slots for the day.</p>
			<p>Like a sorcerer, an arcanist can choose to apply any metamagic feats she knows to a prepared spell as she casts it, with the same increase in casting time (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook). However, she may also prepare a spell with any metamagic feats she knows and cast it without increasing casting time like a wizard. She cannot combine these options&#151;a spell prepared with metamagic feats cannot be further modified with another metamagic feat at the time of casting (unless she has the metamixing arcanist exploit, detailed below).</p>
			<p><b>Spellbooks: </b>An arcanist must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She can&#146;t prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for read magic (which all arcanists can prepare from memory).</p>
			<p>An arcanist begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard/sorcerer spells plus three 1st-level spells of her choice. The arcanist also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new arcanist level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new arcanist level) for her spellbook. At any time, an arcanist can also add spells found in wizards' or other arcanists' spellbooks to her own (see Arcane Magic Writings).</p>
			<p><b>Arcane Reservoir (Su): </b>An arcanist has an innate pool of magical energy that she can draw upon to fuel her arcanist exploits and enhance her spells. The arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to 3 + the arcanist&#146;s level. Each day, when preparing spells, the arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 her arcanist level. Any points she had from the previous day are lost. She can also regain these points through the consume spells class feature and some arcanist exploits. The arcane reservoir can never hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this total are lost.</p>
			<p>Points from the arcanist reservoir are used to fuel many of the arcanist&#146;s powers. In addition, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action whenever she casts an arcanist spell. If she does, she can choose to increase the caster level by 1 or increase the spell&#146;s DC by 1. She can expend no more than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.</p>
			<p><b>Arcanist Exploits: </b>By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the arcanist learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic. Some of these exploits allow her to break down various forms of magic, adding their essence to her arcane reservoir. At 4st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the arcanist learns a new arcane exploit selected from the following list. An arcanist exploit cannot be selected more than once. Once an arcanist exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Arcanists can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;2. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume spell slots. As with her other spells, these spells are not expended when cast.</p>
			<p><b>Consume Spells (Su): </b>At 1st level, an arcanist can expend an available arcanist spell slot as a move action, making it unavailable for the rest of the day, just as if she had used it to cast a spell. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Doing this adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to the level of the spell slot consumed. She cannot consume cantrips (0 level spells) in this way. Points gained in excess of the reservoir&#146;s maximum are lost.</p>
			<p><b>Air Mastery (Su): </b>Aeromancers specialize in magic that manipulates the wind and sky. Whenever an aeromancer expends a point from her arcane reservoir to increase the caster level of a spell with the air, cold, electricity, or sonic descriptor, she increases that bonus by an additional 1. At 5th level, and every 5 levels thereafter, the amount by which she increases the caster level of such spells further increases by an additional 1 (to a maximum additional caster level increase from this ability of 5 at 20th level).</p>
			<p>Alternatively, if the aeromancer expends a point from her arcane reservoir to increase the saving throw DC of a spell with the air, cold, electricity, or sonic descriptor, she increases it by an additional 1. At 10th level, she increases it by an additional 2 instead.</p>
			<p>This replaces the arcane exploit gained at 1st level.</p>
			<p><b>Wind&#146;s Embrace (Su): </b>At 5th level, an aeromancer can expend 2 points from her arcane reservoir to call upon the winds to gently carry her through the air while protecting her from harm. She is affected as though by the spell air walk and is surrounded by protective winds that function similarly to a wind wall spell, except the effect surrounds only the aeromancer and moves with her wherever she goes. Both of these effects last for 1 minute.</p>
			<p>This replaces the arcane exploit gained at 5th level.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Exploits: </b>At 11th level and every 2 levels thereafter, an arcanist can choose one of the following greater exploits in place of an arcanist exploit.</p>
			<p><b>Rebuking Gale (Su): </b>At 11th level, by expending 3 points from her arcane reservoir, an aeromancer can release a powerful blast of wind to push back her foes. This takes the form of either a 20-foot-radius burst centered on the aeromancer or a 40-foot cone originating from the aeromancer&#146;s space. She can choose which form the wind takes each time she uses the ability. The affected area is filled with hurricane-force winds (75 mph). This makes normal ranged attacks passing through this area impossible, imposes a &#150;8 penalty on ranged attacks from siege weapons that pass through the area, and imposes a &#150;12 penalty on Fly checks attempted within the area. Additionally, Large creatures in the area are in danger of being checked, and Medium or smaller creatures in the area are in danger of being blown away. The winds created by this ability last for 1 round.</p>
			<p>This replaces the arcane exploit gained at 11th level.</p>
			<p>Magical Supremacy (Su): At 20th level, the arcanist learns how to convert her arcane reservoir into spells and back again. She can cast any spell she has prepared by expending a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to 1 + the level of the spell to be cast instead of expending a spell slot. When she casts a spell in this fashion, she treats her caster level as 2 higher than normal, and the DCs of any saving throws associated with the spell increase by 2. She cannot further expend points from her arcane reservoir to enhance a spell cast in this way.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p>All constructs are animated by magic in some capacity. Arcane tinkerers use their knowledge and understanding of magic to disrupt or even destroy constructs.</p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some spellcasters seek the secrets of magic, pursuing the power to make the impossible possible. Others are born with magic in their blood, commanding unbelievable forces as effortlessly as they breathe. Yet still others seek to meld the science of arcane scholars with the natural might of innate casters. These arcanists seek to discover the mysterious laws of magic and through will and expertise bend those forces to their whims. Arcanists are the shapers and tinkers of the arcane world, and no magic can resist their control.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Arcanists are scholars of all things magical. They constantly seek out new forms of magic to discover how they work, and in many cases, to collect the energy of such magic for their own uses. Many arcanists are seen as reckless, more concerned with the potency of magic than the ramifications of unleashing such power.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Arcanists are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with an arcanist&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail (see Arcane Spells and Armor).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An arcanist casts arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, presented in Chapter 10 of the Core Rulebook. An arcanist must prepare her spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, her spells are not expended when they&#146;re cast. Instead, she can cast any spell that she has prepared consuming a spell slot of the appropriate level, assuming she hasn&#146;t yet used up her spell slots per day for that level.</p>
			<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the arcanist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against an arcanist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An arcanist can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3).</p>
			<p>An arcanist may know any number of spells, but the number she can prepare each day is limited. At 1st level, she can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new arcanist level, the number of spells she can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1&#150;2. Unlike the number of spells she can cast per day, the number of spells an arcanist can prepare each day is not affected by her Intelligence score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster instead affect the number of spells an arcanist can prepare.</p>
			<p>An arcanist must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the arcanist decides what spells to prepare and refreshes her available spell slots for the day.</p>
			<p>Like a sorcerer, an arcanist can choose to apply any metamagic feats she knows to a prepared spell as she casts it, with the same increase in casting time (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook). However, she may also prepare a spell with any metamagic feats she knows and cast it without increasing casting time like a wizard. She cannot combine these options&#151;a spell prepared with metamagic feats cannot be further modified with another metamagic feat at the time of casting (unless she has the metamixing arcanist exploit, detailed below).</p>
			<p><b>Spellbooks: </b>An arcanist must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She can&#146;t prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for read magic (which all arcanists can prepare from memory).</p>
			<p>An arcanist begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard/sorcerer spells plus three 1st-level spells of her choice. The arcanist also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new arcanist level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new arcanist level) for her spellbook. At any time, an arcanist can also add spells found in wizards' or other arcanists' spellbooks to her own (see Arcane Magic Writings).</p>
			<p><b>Arcane Reservoir (Su): </b>An arcanist has an innate pool of magical energy that she can draw upon to fuel her arcanist exploits and enhance her spells. The arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to 3 + the arcanist&#146;s level. Each day, when preparing spells, the arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 her arcanist level. Any points she had from the previous day are lost. She can also regain these points through the consume spells class feature and some arcanist exploits. The arcane reservoir can never hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this total are lost.</p>
			<p>Points from the arcanist reservoir are used to fuel many of the arcanist&#146;s powers. In addition, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action whenever she casts an arcanist spell. If she does, she can choose to increase the caster level by 1 or increase the spell&#146;s DC by 1. She can expend no more than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.</p>
			<p><b>Arcanist Exploits: </b>By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the arcanist learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic. Some of these exploits allow her to break down various forms of magic, adding their essence to her arcane reservoir. At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the arcanist learns a new arcane exploit selected from the following list. An arcanist exploit cannot be selected more than once. Once an arcanist exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Arcanists can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;2. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume spell slots. As with her other spells, these spells are not expended when cast.</p>
			<p><b>Consume Spells (Su): </b>At 1st level, an arcanist can expend an available arcanist spell slot as a move action, making it unavailable for the rest of the day, just as if she had used it to cast a spell. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Doing this adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to the level of the spell slot consumed. She cannot consume cantrips (0 level spells) in this way. Points gained in excess of the reservoir&#146;s maximum are lost.</p>
			<p><b>Manipulate Construct (Su): </b>An arcane tinkerer can turn the animating magic of a construct against itself. As a standard action, she can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to impose a &#150;1 penalty on a single construct&#146;s attack and damage rolls for 1 round. The target can attempt a Will save to negate this effect (DC = 10 + half the arcane tinkerer&#146;s level + the arcane tinkerer&#146;s Charisma modifier). At 7th level, instead of gaining an arcanist exploit, an arcane tinkerer can improve her manipulate construct ability to instead affect a construct with slow for 1 round. At 13th level, if the arcane tinkerer has previously improved this ability, instead of gaining an arcanist exploit, she can improve this ability again to instead cause a construct to become helpless for 1 round.</p>
			<p>This replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 1st level.</p>
			<p><b>Break Magic Immunity (Su): </b>At 5th level, an arcane tinkerer can overcome a construct&#146;s immunity to magic. When targeting a construct with a spell, the construct is instead treated as if it has spell resistance equal to 15 + the construct&#146;s CR. At 11th level, a construct is instead treated as if it has spell resistance equal to 11 + the construct&#146;s CR.</p>
			<p>This replaces the arcanist exploits gained at 5th and 11th level.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Exploits: </b>At 11th level and every 2 levels thereafter, an arcanist can choose one of the following greater exploits in place of an arcanist exploit.</p>
			<p><b>Magical Supremacy (Su): </b>At 20th level, the arcanist learns how to convert her arcane reservoir into spells and back again. She can cast any spell she has prepared by expending a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to 1 + the level of the spell to be cast instead of expending a spell slot. When she casts a spell in this fashion, she treats her caster level as 2 higher than normal, and the DCs of any saving throws associated with the spell increase by 2. She cannot further expend points from her arcane reservoir to enhance a spell cast in this way.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p>A small number of arcanists learn to use blades as part of their spellcasting and in combat. While these blade adepts are not as capable with a sword as a true master duelist, their combination of swordplay and arcane power makes them quite deadly.</p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some spellcasters seek the secrets of magic, pursuing the power to make the impossible possible. Others are born with magic in their blood, commanding unbelievable forces as effortlessly as they breathe. Yet still others seek to meld the science of arcane scholars with the natural might of innate casters. These arcanists seek to discover the mysterious laws of magic and through will and expertise bend those forces to their whims. Arcanists are the shapers and tinkers of the arcane world, and no magic can resist their control.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Arcanists are scholars of all things magical. They constantly seek out new forms of magic to discover how they work, and in many cases, to collect the energy of such magic for their own uses. Many arcanists are seen as reckless, more concerned with the potency of magic than the ramifications of unleashing such power.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Classes: </b>Sorcerer and wizard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>2d6 x 10 gp (average 70 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Arcanist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Arcanists are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with an arcanist&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail (see Arcane Spells and Armor).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An arcanist casts arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, presented in Chapter 10 of the Core Rulebook. An arcanist must prepare her spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, her spells are not expended when they&#146;re cast. Instead, she can cast any spell that she has prepared consuming a spell slot of the appropriate level, assuming she hasn&#146;t yet used up her spell slots per day for that level.</p>
			<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the arcanist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against an arcanist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An arcanist can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3).</p>
			<p>An arcanist may know any number of spells, but the number she can prepare each day is limited. At 1st level, she can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new arcanist level, the number of spells she can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1&#150;2. Unlike the number of spells she can cast per day, the number of spells an arcanist can prepare each day is not affected by her Intelligence score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster instead affect the number of spells an arcanist can prepare.</p>
			<p>An arcanist must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the arcanist decides what spells to prepare and refreshes her available spell slots for the day.</p>
			<p>Like a sorcerer, an arcanist can choose to apply any metamagic feats she knows to a prepared spell as she casts it, with the same increase in casting time (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook). However, she may also prepare a spell with any metamagic feats she knows and cast it without increasing casting time like a wizard. She cannot combine these options&#151;a spell prepared with metamagic feats cannot be further modified with another metamagic feat at the time of casting (unless she has the metamixing arcanist exploit, detailed below).</p>
			<p><b>Spellbooks: </b>An arcanist must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She can&#146;t prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for read magic (which all arcanists can prepare from memory).</p>
			<p>An arcanist begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard/sorcerer spells plus three 1st-level spells of her choice. The arcanist also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new arcanist level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new arcanist level) for her spellbook. At any time, an arcanist can also add spells found in wizards' or other arcanists' spellbooks to her own (see Arcane Magic Writings).</p>
			<p><b>Arcane Reservoir (Su): </b>An arcanist has an innate pool of magical energy that she can draw upon to fuel her arcanist exploits and enhance her spells. The arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to 3 + the arcanist&#146;s level. Each day, when preparing spells, the arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 her arcanist level. Any points she had from the previous day are lost. She can also regain these points through the consume spells class feature and some arcanist exploits. The arcane reservoir can never hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this total are lost.</p>
			<p>Points from the arcanist reservoir are used to fuel many of the arcanist&#146;s powers. In addition, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action whenever she casts an arcanist spell. If she does, she can choose to increase the caster level by 1 or increase the spell&#146;s DC by 1. She can expend no more than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.</p>
			<p><b>Arcanist Exploits: </b>By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the arcanist learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic. Some of these exploits allow her to break down various forms of magic, adding their essence to her arcane reservoir. At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the arcanist learns a new arcane exploit selected from the following list. An arcanist exploit cannot be selected more than once. Once an arcanist exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Adept Exploits: </b>A blade adept can select from additional adept exploits.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Arcanists can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;2. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume spell slots. As with her other spells, these spells are not expended when cast.</p>
			<p><b>Consume Spells (Su): </b>At 1st level, an arcanist can expend an available arcanist spell slot as a move action, making it unavailable for the rest of the day, just as if she had used it to cast a spell. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Doing this adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to the level of the spell slot consumed. She cannot consume cantrips (0 level spells) in this way. Points gained in excess of the reservoir&#146;s maximum are lost.</p>
			<p><b>Sword Bond (Su): </b>At 1st level, a blade adept develops a bond with a blade and infuses it with arcane power. This ability works like a wizard&#146;s arcane bond ability save that the blade adept must bond to a one-handed piercing or slashing melee weapon. Additionally, the blade adept gains proficiency with the weapon if it is a simple or martial weapon. This ability replaces the arcanist exploits gained at 1st and 9th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Sentient Sword (Su): </b>At 3rd level, the blade adept&#146;s bonded sword becomes a powerful, sentient black blade. The blade advances as a black blade using the blade adept&#146;s class level in place of the magus&#146;s class level and points from her arcane reservoir in place of the magus&#146;s arcane pool. A blade adept with this class feature cannot have a familiar of any kind, even from another class. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Exploits: </b>At 11th level and every 2 levels thereafter, an arcanist can choose one of the following greater exploits in place of an arcanist exploit.</p>
			<p><b>Magical Supremacy (Su): </b>At 20th level, the arcanist learns how to convert her arcane reservoir into spells and back again. She can cast any spell she has prepared by expending a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to 1 + the level of the spell to be cast instead of expending a spell slot. When she casts a spell in this fashion, she treats her caster level as 2 higher than normal, and the DCs of any saving throws associated with the spell increase by 2.

					<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the arcanist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against an arcanist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>

She cannot combine these options&#151;a spell prepared with metamagic feats cannot be further modified with another metamagic feat at the time of casting (unless she has the metamixing arcanist exploit, detailed below).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p>Though most arcanists possess only a rudimentary innate arcane gift, the blood arcanist has the full power of a bloodline to draw upon.</p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some spellcasters seek the secrets of magic, pursuing the power to make the impossible possible. Others are born with magic in their blood, commanding unbelievable forces as effortlessly as they breathe. Yet still others seek to meld the science of arcane scholars with the natural might of innate casters. These arcanists seek to discover the mysterious laws of magic and through will and expertise bend those forces to their whims. Arcanists are the shapers and tinkers of the arcane world, and no magic can resist their control.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Arcanists are scholars of all things magical. They constantly seek out new forms of magic to discover how they work, and in many cases, to collect the energy of such magic for their own uses. Many arcanists are seen as reckless, more concerned with the potency of magic than the ramifications of unleashing such power.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Classes: </b>Sorcerer and wizard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>2d6 x 10 gp (average 70 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Arcanist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

In addition, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action whenever she casts an arcanist spell. If she does, she can choose to increase the caster level by 1 or increase the spell&#146;s DC by 1. She can expend no more than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.</p>
			<p><b>Arcanist Exploits: </b>By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the arcanist learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic. Some of these exploits allow her to break down various forms of magic, adding their essence to her arcane reservoir. At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the arcanist learns a new arcane exploit selected from the following list. An arcanist exploit cannot be selected more than once. Once an arcanist exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Bloodline: </b>A blood arcanist selects one bloodline from those available through the sorcerer bloodline class feature. The blood arcanist gains the bloodline arcana and bloodline powers of that bloodline, treating her arcanist level as her sorcerer level. The blood arcanist does not gain the class skill, bonus feats, or bonus spells from her bloodline.</p>
			<p>If the blood arcanist takes levels in another class that grants a bloodline, the bloodlines must be the same type, even if that means that the bloodline of one of her classes must change. Subject to GM discretion, the blood arcanist can change her former bloodline to make them conform.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Arcanists can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;2. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume spell slots. As with her other spells, these spells are not expended when cast.</p>
			<p><b>Consume Spells (Su): </b>At 1st level, an arcanist can expend an available arcanist spell slot as a move action, making it unavailable for the rest of the day, just as if she had used it to cast a spell. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Doing this adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to the level of the spell slot consumed. She cannot consume cantrips (0 level spells) in this way. Points gained in excess of the reservoir&#146;s maximum are lost.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Exploits: </b>At 11th level and every 2 levels thereafter, an arcanist can choose one of the following greater exploits in place of an arcanist exploit.</p>
			<p><b>Magical Supremacy (Su): </b>At 20th level, the arcanist learns how to convert her arcane reservoir into spells and back again. She can cast any spell she has prepared by expending a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to 1 + the level of the spell to be cast instead of expending a spell slot. When she casts a spell in this fashion, she treats her caster level as 2 higher than normal, and the DCs of any saving throws associated with the spell increase by 2. She cannot further expend points from her arcane reservoir to enhance a spell cast in this way.</p>

					<p>An arcanist casts arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, presented in Chapter 10 of the Core Rulebook. An arcanist must prepare her spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, her spells are not expended when they&#146;re cast. Instead, she can cast any spell that she has prepared consuming a spell slot of the appropriate level, assuming she hasn&#146;t yet used up her spell slots per day for that level.</p>
					<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the arcanist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against an arcanist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
					<p>An arcanist can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3).</p>
					<p>An arcanist may know any number of spells, but the number she can prepare each day is limited. At 1st level, she can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new arcanist level, the number of spells she can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1&#150;2. Unlike the number of spells she can cast per day, the number of spells an arcanist can prepare each day is not affected by her Intelligence score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster instead affect the number of spells an arcanist can prepare.</p>
					<p>An arcanist must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the arcanist decides what spells to prepare and refreshes her available spell slots for the day.</p>
					<p>Like a sorcerer, an arcanist can choose to apply any metamagic feats she knows to a prepared spell as she casts it, with the same increase in casting time (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook). However, she may also prepare a spell with any metamagic feats she knows and cast it without increasing casting time like a wizard. She cannot combine these options&#151;a spell prepared with metamagic feats cannot be further modified with another metamagic feat at the time of casting (unless she has the metamixing arcanist exploit, detailed below).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p>Frequently called &#147;brown-furs,&#148; these transmutation-focused arcanists are known for transforming themselves into animals. What few realize is that these specialized arcanists excel at turning themselves&#151;and others&#151;into all kinds of creatures.</p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some spellcasters seek the secrets of magic, pursuing the power to make the impossible possible. Others are born with magic in their blood, commanding unbelievable forces as effortlessly as they breathe. Yet still others seek to meld the science of arcane scholars with the natural might of innate casters. These arcanists seek to discover the mysterious laws of magic and through will and expertise bend those forces to their whims. Arcanists are the shapers and tinkers of the arcane world, and no magic can resist their control.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Arcanists are scholars of all things magical. They constantly seek out new forms of magic to discover how they work, and in many cases, to collect the energy of such magic for their own uses. Many arcanists are seen as reckless, more concerned with the potency of magic than the ramifications of unleashing such power.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Classes: </b>Sorcerer and wizard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>2d6 x 10 gp (average 70 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Arcanist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Arcanists are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with an arcanist&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail (see Arcane Spells and Armor).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An arcanist casts arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, presented in Chapter 10 of the Core Rulebook. An arcanist must prepare her spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, her spells are not expended when they&#146;re cast. Instead, she can cast any spell that she has prepared consuming a spell slot of the appropriate level, assuming she hasn&#146;t yet used up her spell slots per day for that level.</p>
			<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the arcanist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against an arcanist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An arcanist can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3).</p>
			<p>An arcanist may know any number of spells, but the number she can prepare each day is limited. At 1st level, she can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new arcanist level, the number of spells she can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1&#150;2. Unlike the number of spells she can cast per day, the number of spells an arcanist can prepare each day is not affected by her Intelligence score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster instead affect the number of spells an arcanist can prepare.</p>
			<p>An arcanist must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the arcanist decides what spells to prepare and refreshes her available spell slots for the day.</p>
			<p>Like a sorcerer, an arcanist can choose to apply any metamagic feats she knows to a prepared spell as she casts it, with the same increase in casting time (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook). However, she may also prepare a spell with any metamagic feats she knows and cast it without increasing casting time like a wizard. She cannot combine these options&#151;a spell prepared with metamagic feats cannot be further modified with another metamagic feat at the time of casting (unless she has the metamixing arcanist exploit, detailed below).</p>
			<p><b>Spellbooks: </b>An arcanist must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She can&#146;t prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for read magic (which all arcanists can prepare from memory).</p>
			<p>An arcanist begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard/sorcerer spells plus three 1st-level spells of her choice. The arcanist also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new arcanist level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new arcanist level) for her spellbook. At any time, an arcanist can also add spells found in wizards' or other arcanists' spellbooks to her own (see Arcane Magic Writings).</p>
			<p><b>Arcane Reservoir (Su): </b>An arcanist has an innate pool of magical energy that she can draw upon to fuel her arcanist exploits and enhance her spells. The arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to 3 + the arcanist&#146;s level. Each day, when preparing spells, the arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 her arcanist level. Any points she had from the previous day are lost. She can also regain these points through the consume spells class feature and some arcanist exploits. The arcane reservoir can never hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this total are lost.</p>
			<p>Points from the arcanist reservoir are used to fuel many of the arcanist&#146;s powers. In addition, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action whenever she casts an arcanist spell. If she does, she can choose to increase the caster level by 1 or increase the spell&#146;s DC by 1. She can expend no more than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.</p>
			<p><b>Arcanist Exploits: </b>By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the arcanist learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic. Some of these exploits allow her to break down various forms of magic, adding their essence to her arcane reservoir. At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the arcanist learns a new arcane exploit selected from the following list. An arcanist exploit cannot be selected more than once. Once an arcanist exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Arcanists can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;2. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume spell slots. As with her other spells, these spells are not expended when cast.</p>
			<p><b>Consume Spells (Su): </b>At 1st level, an arcanist can expend an available arcanist spell slot as a move action, making it unavailable for the rest of the day, just as if she had used it to cast a spell. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Doing this adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to the level of the spell slot consumed. She cannot consume cantrips (0 level spells) in this way. Points gained in excess of the reservoir&#146;s maximum are lost.</p>
			<p><b>Powerful Change (Su): </b>At 3rd level, the brown-fur transmuter learns to harness the power of her magic to empower her transmutations. Whenever the brown-fur transmuter casts a transmutation spell using one of her arcanist spell slots, she can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action to bolster the spell. If the spell grants a bonus to an ability score, the bonus then increases by 2. If it grants a bonus to more than one ability score, only one of the ability scores gains this bonus. The brownfur transmuter cannot expend more than 1 point from her arcane reservoir in this way. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Share Transmutation (Su): </b>At 9th level, the brown-fur transmuter can target others with her transmutation spells. A brown-fur transmuter can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to change any transmutation spell with a range of personal to a range of touch. Such a spell automatically fails on unwilling creatures. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 9th level.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Exploits: </b>At 11th level and every 2 levels thereafter, an arcanist can choose one of the following greater exploits in place of an arcanist exploit.</p>
			<p><b>Transmutation Supremacy (Su): </b>At 20th level, the brown-fur transmuter learns to fully master the power of transmutation. Whenever she casts a transmutation spell, it is treated as it were affected by the Extend Spell feat without altering the casting time or slot used. (She cannot then alter its duration again with the Extend Spell feat). Whenever she uses her powerful change ability, the bonus increases by 4 instead of 2. Her share transmutation ability can now target a willing creature within 30 feet. This ability replaces magical supremacy. <b></b></p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p>For some arcanists, the power bubbling up from within is nearly too much to contain. They become adept at shaping this magical energy without needing to bind it up in spells.</p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some spellcasters seek the secrets of magic, pursuing the power to make the impossible possible. Others are born with magic in their blood, commanding unbelievable forces as effortlessly as they breathe. Yet still others seek to meld the science of arcane scholars with the natural might of innate casters. These arcanists seek to discover the mysterious laws of magic and through will and expertise bend those forces to their whims. Arcanists are the shapers and tinkers of the arcane world, and no magic can resist their control.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Arcanists are scholars of all things magical. They constantly seek out new forms of magic to discover how they work, and in many cases, to collect the energy of such magic for their own uses. Many arcanists are seen as reckless, more concerned with the potency of magic than the ramifications of unleashing such power.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Classes: </b>Sorcerer and wizard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>2d6 x 10 gp (average 70 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Arcanist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Arcanists are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with an arcanist&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail (see Arcane Spells and Armor).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An arcanist casts arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, presented in Chapter 10 of the Core Rulebook. An arcanist must prepare her spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, her spells are not expended when they&#146;re cast. Instead, she can cast any spell that she has prepared consuming a spell slot of the appropriate level, assuming she hasn&#146;t yet used up her spell slots per day for that level.</p>
			<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the arcanist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against an arcanist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An arcanist can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3).</p>
			<p>An arcanist may know any number of spells, but the number she can prepare each day is limited. At 1st level, she can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new arcanist level, the number of spells she can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1&#150;2. Unlike the number of spells she can cast per day, the number of spells an arcanist can prepare each day is not affected by her Intelligence score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster instead affect the number of spells an arcanist can prepare.</p>
			<p>An arcanist must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the arcanist decides what spells to prepare and refreshes her available spell slots for the day.</p>
			<p>Like a sorcerer, an arcanist can choose to apply any metamagic feats she knows to a prepared spell as she casts it, with the same increase in casting time (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook). However, she may also prepare a spell with any metamagic feats she knows and cast it without increasing casting time like a wizard. She cannot combine these options&#151;a spell prepared with metamagic feats cannot be further modified with another metamagic feat at the time of casting (unless she has the metamixing arcanist exploit, detailed below).</p>
			<p><b>Spellbooks: </b>An arcanist must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She can&#146;t prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for read magic (which all arcanists can prepare from memory).</p>
			<p>An arcanist begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard/sorcerer spells plus three 1st-level spells of her choice. The arcanist also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new arcanist level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new arcanist level) for her spellbook. At any time, an arcanist can also add spells found in wizards' or other arcanists' spellbooks to her own (see Arcane Magic Writings).</p>
			<p><b>Arcane Reservoir (Su): </b>An arcanist has an innate pool of magical energy that she can draw upon to fuel her arcanist exploits and enhance her spells. The arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to 3 + the arcanist&#146;s level. Each day, when preparing spells, the arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 her arcanist level. Any points she had from the previous day are lost. She can also regain these points through the consume spells class feature and some arcanist exploits. The arcane reservoir can never hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this total are lost.</p>
			<p>Points from the arcanist reservoir are used to fuel many of the arcanist&#146;s powers. In addition, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action whenever she casts an arcanist spell. If she does, she can choose to increase the caster level by 1 or increase the spell&#146;s DC by 1. She can expend no more than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.</p>
			<p><b>Arcanist Exploits: </b>By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the arcanist learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic. Some of these exploits allow her to break down various forms of magic, adding their essence to her arcane reservoir. At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the arcanist learns a new arcane exploit selected from the following list. An arcanist exploit cannot be selected more than once. Once an arcanist exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Arcanists can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;2. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume spell slots. As with her other spells, these spells are not expended when cast.</p>
			<p><b>Consume Spells (Su): </b>At 1st level, an arcanist can expend an available arcanist spell slot as a move action, making it unavailable for the rest of the day, just as if she had used it to cast a spell. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Doing this adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to the level of the spell slot consumed. She cannot consume cantrips (0 level spells) in this way. Points gained in excess of the reservoir&#146;s maximum are lost.</p>
			<p><b>Font of Power: </b>An eldritch font gains one additional spell slot for each level of arcanist spell she can cast. However, the number of spells of each level that she can prepare reduces by 1. If this reduces her spells prepared for a level to 0, she still gains spell slots of that level, which can be consumed using the consume spells class feature to fuel her arcane reservoir or cast spells using metamagic feats.</p>
			<p><b>Eldritch Surge (Su): </b>At 3rd level, an eldritch font can, as a swift action, pour more power into her spells and abilities. She can add 2 to the caster level and DC of a spell, or increase her effective arcanist level by 2 when using an arcanist exploit. She becomes fatigued upon using this ability. If she is already fatigued, she becomes exhausted. If she&#146;s already exhausted, or something would prevent her from becoming fatigued or exhausted, she cannot use this ability. This ability does not stack with spending points from her arcane reservoir to increase the spell&#146;s caster level or DC (as the arcane reservoir class feature). Only rest can remove fatigue or exhaustion caused by an eldritch surge&#151;spells and abilities have no effect. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Surge (Su): </b>At 7th level, an eldritch font can use her eldritch surge ability to reroll an attack roll associated with a spell or arcanist exploit, or to reroll all of the damage dice associated with a spell or arcanist exploit. In the case of attack rolls, this ability must be used after the die is rolled but before the results are revealed. The eldritch font must take the results of the reroll, even if they are lower. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 7th level.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Exploits: </b>At 11th level and every 2 levels thereafter, an arcanist can choose one of the following greater exploits in place of an arcanist exploit.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Surge (Su): </b>At 13th level, an eldritch font can use her eldritch surge ability to force a creature to reroll a saving throw against one spell or arcanist exploit and take the lower value. The eldritch font must declare the use of this ability before the result of that creature&#146;s saving throw is revealed. If the spell or arcanist exploit affects more than one target, only one target is affected by this ability. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 13th level.</p>
			<p><b>Bottomless Well: </b>At 20th level, an eldritch font can spend 1 hour studying her spellbook to refuel herself. Doing so allows her to prepare new spells and regain points of arcane reservoir equal to 1/2 her level. She can use this ability multiple times per day, however she still only regains spell slots once per day. This ability replaces magical supremacy.</p>

					<p>By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the arcanist learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p>Arcanists with an affinity for elemental forces sometimes focus on one and display its power in everything they do.</p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some spellcasters seek the secrets of magic, pursuing the power to make the impossible possible. Others are born with magic in their blood, commanding unbelievable forces as effortlessly as they breathe. Yet still others seek to meld the science of arcane scholars with the natural might of innate casters. These arcanists seek to discover the mysterious laws of magic and through will and expertise bend those forces to their whims. Arcanists are the shapers and tinkers of the arcane world, and no magic can resist their control.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Arcanists are scholars of all things magical. They constantly seek out new forms of magic to discover how they work, and in many cases, to collect the energy of such magic for their own uses. Many arcanists are seen as reckless, more concerned with the potency of magic than the ramifications of unleashing such power.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Classes: </b>Sorcerer and wizard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>2d6 x 10 gp (average 70 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Arcanist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Arcanists are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with an arcanist&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail (see Arcane Spells and Armor).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An arcanist casts arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, presented in Chapter 10 of the Core Rulebook. An arcanist must prepare her spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, her spells are not expended when they&#146;re cast. Instead, she can cast any spell that she has prepared consuming a spell slot of the appropriate level, assuming she hasn&#146;t yet used up her spell slots per day for that level.</p>
			<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the arcanist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against an arcanist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An arcanist can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3).</p>
			<p>An arcanist may know any number of spells, but the number she can prepare each day is limited. At 1st level, she can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new arcanist level, the number of spells she can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1&#150;2. Unlike the number of spells she can cast per day, the number of spells an arcanist can prepare each day is not affected by her Intelligence score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster instead affect the number of spells an arcanist can prepare.</p>
			<p>An arcanist must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the arcanist decides what spells to prepare and refreshes her available spell slots for the day.</p>
			<p>Like a sorcerer, an arcanist can choose to apply any metamagic feats she knows to a prepared spell as she casts it, with the same increase in casting time (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook). However, she may also prepare a spell with any metamagic feats she knows and cast it without increasing casting time like a wizard. She cannot combine these options&#151;a spell prepared with metamagic feats cannot be further modified with another metamagic feat at the time of casting (unless she has the metamixing arcanist exploit, detailed below).</p>
			<p><b>Spellbooks: </b>An arcanist must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She can&#146;t prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for read magic (which all arcanists can prepare from memory).</p>
			<p>An arcanist begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard/sorcerer spells plus three 1st-level spells of her choice. The arcanist also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new arcanist level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new arcanist level) for her spellbook. At any time, an arcanist can also add spells found in wizards' or other arcanists' spellbooks to her own (see Arcane Magic Writings).</p>
			<p><b>Arcane Reservoir (Su): </b>An arcanist has an innate pool of magical energy that she can draw upon to fuel her arcanist exploits and enhance her spells. The arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to 3 + the arcanist&#146;s level. Each day, when preparing spells, the arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 her arcanist level. Any points she had from the previous day are lost. She can also regain these points through the consume spells class feature and some arcanist exploits. The arcane reservoir can never hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this total are lost.</p>
			<p>Points from the arcanist reservoir are used to fuel many of the arcanist&#146;s powers. In addition, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action whenever she casts an arcanist spell. If she does, she can choose to increase the caster level by 1 or increase the spell&#146;s DC by 1. She can expend no more than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.</p>
			<p><b>Arcanist Exploits: </b>By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the arcanist learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic. Some of these exploits allow her to break down various forms of magic, adding their essence to her arcane reservoir. At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the arcanist learns a new arcane exploit selected from the following list. An arcanist exploit cannot be selected more than once. Once an arcanist exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Arcanists can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;2. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume spell slots. As with her other spells, these spells are not expended when cast.</p>
			<p><b>Consume Spells (Su): </b>At 1st level, an arcanist can expend an available arcanist spell slot as a move action, making it unavailable for the rest of the day, just as if she had used it to cast a spell. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Doing this adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to the level of the spell slot consumed. She cannot consume cantrips (0 level spells) in this way. Points gained in excess of the reservoir&#146;s maximum are lost.</p>
			<p><b>Elemental Focus (Su): </b>At 1st level, the elemental master must select one element: air, earth, fire, or water. The arcanist can prepare one additional spell per day of each level she can cast, but it must have the elemental descriptor of her chosen element. In addition, any spell she prepares from the opposite elemental school (air opposes earth, fire opposes water) takes up two of her prepared spell slots. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 1st level.</p>
			<p><b>Elemental Attack (Su): </b>At 3rd level, the elemental master gains an arcanist exploit tied to her element. If she selected air, she gains the lightning lance arcanist exploit. If she selected earth, she gains the acid jet arcanist exploit. If she selected fire, she gains the flame arc arcanist exploit. If she selected water, she gains the ice missile arcanist exploit. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Powerful Exploit (Su): </b>At 9th level, an elemental master increases the damage done by her elemental attack to 1d8 points of energy damage plus 1d8 points of damage per two arcanist levels she possesses. The type of damage is determined by the elemental attack. In addition, the range for the elemental attack ability increases to 60 feet (in the case of flame arc, a 60-foot line). This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 9th level.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Elemental Attack (Su): </b>At 11th level, the elemental master gains a greater arcanist exploit tied to her element. If she selected air, she gains the dancing electricity arcanist exploit. If she selected earth, she gains the lingering acid arcanist exploit. If she selected fire, she gains the burning flame arcanist exploit. If she selected water, she gains the icy tomb arcanist exploit. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 11th level.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Exploits: </b>At 11th level and every 2 levels thereafter, an arcanist can choose one of the following greater exploits in place of an arcanist exploit.</p>
			<p><b>Elemental Movement (Su): </b>At 15th level, an elemental master gains an elemental movement. This enhancement is based on her chosen element type. Air grants a fly speed of 90 feet (average maneuverability), earth grants a burrow speed of 30 feet, fire grants a increase of 30 feet to base land speed, and water grants a swim speed of 60 feet. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 15th level.</p>
			<p><b>Magical Supremacy (Su): </b>At 20th level, the arcanist learns how to convert her arcane reservoir into spells and back again. She can cast any spell she has prepared by expending a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to 1 + the level of the spell to be cast instead of expending a spell slot. When she casts a spell in this fashion, she treats her caster level as 2 higher than normal, and the DCs of any saving throws associated with the spell increase by 2. She cannot further expend points from her arcane reservoir to enhance a spell cast in this way.</p>

If she does, she can choose to increase the caster level by 1 or increase the spell&#146;s DC by 1. She can expend no more than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.</p>

					<p>An arcanist must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She can&#146;t prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for read magic (which all arcanists can prepare from memory).</p>
					<p>An arcanist begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard/sorcerer spells plus three 1st-level spells of her choice. The arcanist also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new arcanist level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new arcanist level) for her spellbook. At any time, an arcanist can also add spells found in wizards' or other arcanists' spellbooks to her own.</p>

					<p>By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the arcanist learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic. Some of these exploits allow her to break down various forms of magic, adding their essence to her arcane reservoir.

Once an arcanist exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function.

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 9th level, a Tarot student can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir and draw a card from her harrow deck as a standard action to learn her own fate or that of an ally within 30 feet. The target&#146;s fate depends on the suit of the card drawn from the deck.</p>
					<list>
						<li><i>Books: </i>The target gains a +2 insight bonus on her next caster level check.</li>
						<li><i>Crowns: </i>The target gains a +2 insight bonus on her next saving throw.</li>
						<li><i>Hammers: </i>The target gains a +4 insight bonus on the damage roll of her next successful melee attack.</li>
						<li><i>Keys: </i>The target gains a +4 insight bonus on her next initiative check.</li>
						<li><i>Shields: </i>The next time the target receives magical healing, she regains an additional number of hit points equal to the Tarot student&#146;s arcanist class level.</li>
						<li><i>Stars: </i>The target gains a +4 insight bonus on her next skill check.</li>
					</list>
					<p>A creature cannot have more than one trump card in effect at one time; drawing a new trump card for a target negates the effect of the previous trump card. A Tarot student can attempt to read the fate of an enemy within 30 feet, resulting in a penalty for that target equal to the bonus granted above, but the target is entitled to a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the Tarot student&#146;s arcanist level + her Charisma modifier) to negate the effect. This is considered a curse effect. A Tarot student can have trump cards in effect for multiple creatures at the same time.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p>The secretive Tarot Society focuses its efforts on the intellectual study of the region&#146;s supernatural quirks and hidden history, and embraces the use of decks of cards to examine the world&#146;s occult mysteries. (This archetype is intended for use with a tarot card set. If you don&#146;t have access to that product, roll 1d6 to determine a drawn card&#146;s suit: 1 = hammers, 2 = keys, 3 = shields, 4 = books, 5 = stars, and 6 = crowns.)</p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some spellcasters seek the secrets of magic, pursuing the power to make the impossible possible. Others are born with magic in their blood, commanding unbelievable forces as effortlessly as they breathe. Yet still others seek to meld the science of arcane scholars with the natural might of innate casters. These arcanists seek to discover the mysterious laws of magic and through will and expertise bend those forces to their whims. Arcanists are the shapers and tinkers of the arcane world, and no magic can resist their control.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Arcanists are scholars of all things magical. They constantly seek out new forms of magic to discover how they work, and in many cases, to collect the energy of such magic for their own uses. Many arcanists are seen as reckless, more concerned with the potency of magic than the ramifications of unleashing such power.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Classes: </b>Sorcerer and wizard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>2d6 x 10 gp (average 70 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Arcanist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Arcanists are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with an arcanist&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail (see Arcane Spells and Armor).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An arcanist casts arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, presented in Chapter 10 of the Core Rulebook. An arcanist must prepare her spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, her spells are not expended when they&#146;re cast. Instead, she can cast any spell that she has prepared consuming a spell slot of the appropriate level, assuming she hasn&#146;t yet used up her spell slots per day for that level.</p>
			<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the arcanist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against an arcanist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An arcanist can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3).</p>
			<p>An arcanist may know any number of spells, but the number she can prepare each day is limited. At 1st level, she can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new arcanist level, the number of spells she can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1&#150;2. Unlike the number of spells she can cast per day, the number of spells an arcanist can prepare each day is not affected by her Intelligence score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster instead affect the number of spells an arcanist can prepare.</p>
			<p>An arcanist must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the arcanist decides what spells to prepare and refreshes her available spell slots for the day.</p>
			<p>Like a sorcerer, an arcanist can choose to apply any metamagic feats she knows to a prepared spell as she casts it, with the same increase in casting time (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook). However, she may also prepare a spell with any metamagic feats she knows and cast it without increasing casting time like a wizard. She cannot combine these options&#151;a spell prepared with metamagic feats cannot be further modified with another metamagic feat at the time of casting (unless she has the metamixing arcanist exploit, detailed below).</p>
			<p><b>Spellbooks: </b>An arcanist must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She can&#146;t prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for read magic (which all arcanists can prepare from memory).</p>
			<p>An arcanist begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard/sorcerer spells plus three 1st-level spells of her choice. The arcanist also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new arcanist level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new arcanist level) for her spellbook. At any time, an arcanist can also add spells found in wizards' or other arcanists' spellbooks to her own (see Arcane Magic Writings).</p>
			<p><b>Arcane Reservoir (Su): </b>An arcanist has an innate pool of magical energy that she can draw upon to fuel her arcanist exploits and enhance her spells. The arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to 3 + the arcanist&#146;s level. Each day, when preparing spells, the arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 her arcanist level. Any points she had from the previous day are lost. She can also regain these points through the consume spells class feature and some arcanist exploits. The arcane reservoir can never hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this total are lost.</p>
			<p>Points from the arcanist reservoir are used to fuel many of the arcanist&#146;s powers. In addition, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action whenever she casts an arcanist spell. If she does, she can choose to increase the caster level by 1 or increase the spell&#146;s DC by 1. She can expend no more than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.</p>
			<p><b>Arcanist Exploits: </b>By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the arcanist learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic. Some of these exploits allow her to break down various forms of magic, adding their essence to her arcane reservoir. At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the arcanist learns a new arcane exploit selected from the following list. An arcanist exploit cannot be selected more than once. Once an arcanist exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Arcanists can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;2. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume spell slots. As with her other spells, these spells are not expended when cast.</p>
			<p><b>Psychic Reader (Ex): </b>A Tarot student gains Psychic Sensitivity as a bonus feat and adds Diplomacy, Perception, and Sense Motive to her list of class skills. This ability replaces the 1st-level arcanist exploit.</p>
			<p><b>Tarot Reservoir (Ex): </b>Once per day, a Tarot student can perform a harrow reading as a 5-minute ritual. She decides which suit most closely aligns with her task at hand and deals a nine-card spread. Each time that suit appears in her spread, she adds 1 point to her arcane reservoir, to a maximum of 1 point per 2 arcanist levels.</p>
			<p>Points gained in excess of her reservoir&#146;s maximum are lost.</p>
			<p>The Tarot student can perform this reading one additional time per day at 8th level and at 16th level.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces consume spells.</p>
			<p><b>Divine the Mysteries (Ex): </b>At 5th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a Tarot student can select a divination spell from the spell list of any class, including classes that cast divine or psychic spells and add it to her list of spells known. This spell must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell she can cast. She casts these spells as arcane spells, using her normal spell slots, but must use a harrow deck as an additional focus component.</p>
			<p>If such a spell is normally a psychic spell with an emotion or thought component, she must also add that component.</p>
			<p><b>Trump Card (Su): </b>At 9th level, a Tarot student can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir and draw a card from her harrow deck as a standard action to learn her own fate or that of an ally within 30 feet. The target&#146;s fate depends on the suit of the card drawn from the deck.</p>
			<list>
				<li><i>Books: </i>The target gains a +2 insight bonus on her next caster level check.</li>
				<li><i>Crowns: </i>The target gains a +2 insight bonus on her next saving throw.</li>
				<li><i>Hammers: </i>The target gains a +4 insight bonus on the damage roll of her next successful melee attack.</li>
				<li><i>Keys: </i>The target gains a +4 insight bonus on her next initiative check.</li>
				<li><i>Shields: </i>The next time the target receives magical healing, she regains an additional number of hit points equal to the Tarot student&#146;s arcanist class level.</li>
				<li><i>Stars: </i>The target gains a +4 insight bonus on her next skill check.</li>
			</list>
			<p>A creature cannot have more than one trump card in effect at one time; drawing a new trump card for a target negates the effect of the previous trump card. A Tarot student can attempt to read the fate of an enemy within 30 feet, resulting in a penalty for that target equal to the bonus granted above, but the target is entitled to a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the Tarot student&#146;s arcanist level + her Charisma modifier) to negate the effect. This is considered a curse effect. A Tarot student can have trump cards in effect for multiple creatures at the same time.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the 9th-level arcanist exploit.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Exploits: </b>At 11th level and every 2 levels thereafter, an arcanist can choose one of the following greater exploits in place of an arcanist exploit.</p>
			<p><b>Magical Supremacy (Su): </b>At 20th level, the arcanist learns how to convert her arcane reservoir into spells and back again. She can cast any spell she has prepared by expending a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to 1 + the level of the spell to be cast instead of expending a spell slot. When she casts a spell in this fashion, she treats her caster level as 2 higher than normal, and the DCs of any saving throws associated with the spell increase by 2. She cannot further expend points from her arcane reservoir to enhance a spell cast in this way.</p>

An arcanist must prepare her spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, her spells are not expended when they&#146;re cast. Instead, she can cast any spell that she has prepared consuming a spell slot of the appropriate level, assuming she hasn&#146;t yet used up her spell slots per day for that level.</p>
					<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the arcanist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against an arcanist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
					<p>An arcanist can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3).</p>
					<p>An arcanist may know any number of spells, but the number she can prepare each day is limited. At 1st level, she can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new arcanist level, the number of spells she can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1&#150;2. Unlike the number of spells she can cast per day, the number of spells an arcanist can prepare each day is not affected by her Intelligence score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster instead affect the number of spells an arcanist can prepare.</p>
					<p>An arcanist must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the arcanist decides what spells to prepare and refreshes her available spell slots for the day.</p>

					<p>At 5th level, a Collegiate initiate gains Spell Mastery as a bonus feat. Her arcanist levels count as wizard levels for the purpose of satisfying feat prerequisites, both when selecting this bonus feat and when selecting feats gained from character advancement. If she uses her arcanist level to satisfy the prerequisites for Spell Mastery, she can prepare spells selected with this feat as arcanist spells without referring to a spellbook, but not as wizard spells. The Collegiate initiate can also select Spell Mastery as a feat gained from character advancement, allowing her to select the feat multiple times.</p>
					<p>In addition, if the Collegiate initiate gains levels in the collegiate arcanist prestige class, her prestige class levels stack with her arcanist levels when determining the number of points in her arcane reservoir (though not the effectiveness of arcane exploits based on class level). A Collegiate initiate who takes levels in collegiate arcanist and gains the spontaneous spell Mastery class feature can use that ability to instantly lose one of her prepared spells and immediately prepare a different arcanist spell of the same level or lower that she has mastered with Spell Mastery, rather than spontaneous spell mastery&#146;s normal effect. She is still limited to the same number of times per day she can use spontaneous spell mastery.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Aspiring students of the Magaambya often spend decades researching arcane magic while learning to follow in the footsteps of the academy&#146;s founder, Old-Mage Jatembe. Those particularly gifted in the art of sculpting spells are sometimes schooled privately in the art of traditional, esoteric, and righteous spells, in the hope that such knowledge will pave the way for the initiate&#146;s acceptance into the school proper as a Magaambyan arcanist.</i></p>
			<p><i>But many initiates find themselves overwhelmed by the extensive training and end up leaving the Magaambya before completing their studies. These spellcasters retain many of the Magaambya&#146;s techniques and philosophical bents, but are not considered to be graduates of the school. Yet they are still respected and valued, for the Magaambya&#146;s staff fully understand that its teachings and the scholastic, often hermetic lifestyle required to master the techniques are not to everyone&#146;s tastes. For the teachers of the Magaambya, there are no truly failed students save those who abandon their philosophy and succumb to the lure of cruelty and evil.</i></p>
			<p><i>Because they hold the Magaambya&#146;s interests close to their hearts but are not hindered by the need to remain close at hand to study or serve as teachers or assistants, Magaambyan initiates often serve as strong supporters beyond the normal reach of the Magaambya. Furthermore, Magaambyan initiates can act immediately against the forces of evil without waiting to be officially sent out into the world.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some spellcasters seek the secrets of magic, pursuing the power to make the impossible possible. Others are born with magic in their blood, commanding unbelievable forces as effortlessly as they breathe. Yet still others seek to meld the science of arcane scholars with the natural might of innate casters. These arcanists seek to discover the mysterious laws of magic and through will and expertise bend those forces to their whims. Arcanists are the shapers and tinkers of the arcane world, and no magic can resist their control.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Arcanists are scholars of all things magical. They constantly seek out new forms of magic to discover how they work, and in many cases, to collect the energy of such magic for their own uses. Many arcanists are seen as reckless, more concerned with the potency of magic than the ramifications of unleashing such power.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any good.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Classes: </b>Sorcerer and wizard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>2d6 x 10 gp (average 70 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Arcanist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Arcanists are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with an arcanist&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail (see Arcane Spells and Armor).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An arcanist casts arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, presented in Chapter 10 of the Core Rulebook. An arcanist must prepare her spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, her spells are not expended when they&#146;re cast. Instead, she can cast any spell that she has prepared consuming a spell slot of the appropriate level, assuming she hasn&#146;t yet used up her spell slots per day for that level.</p>
			<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the arcanist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against an arcanist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An arcanist can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3).</p>
			<p>An arcanist may know any number of spells, but the number she can prepare each day is limited. At 1st level, she can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new arcanist level, the number of spells she can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1&#150;2. Unlike the number of spells she can cast per day, the number of spells an arcanist can prepare each day is not affected by her Intelligence score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster instead affect the number of spells an arcanist can prepare.</p>
			<p>An arcanist must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the arcanist decides what spells to prepare and refreshes her available spell slots for the day.</p>
			<p>Like a sorcerer, an arcanist can choose to apply any metamagic feats she knows to a prepared spell as she casts it, with the same increase in casting time (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook). However, she may also prepare a spell with any metamagic feats she knows and cast it without increasing casting time like a wizard. She cannot combine these options&#151;a spell prepared with metamagic feats cannot be further modified with another metamagic feat at the time of casting (unless she has the metamixing arcanist exploit, detailed below).</p>
			<p><b>Spellbooks: </b>An arcanist must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She can&#146;t prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for read magic (which all arcanists can prepare from memory).</p>
			<p>An arcanist begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard/sorcerer spells plus three 1st-level spells of her choice. The arcanist also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new arcanist level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new arcanist level) for her spellbook. At any time, an arcanist can also add spells found in wizards' or other arcanists' spellbooks to her own (see Arcane Magic Writings).</p>
			<p><b>Arcane Reservoir (Su): </b>An arcanist has an innate pool of magical energy that she can draw upon to fuel her arcanist exploits and enhance her spells. The arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to 3 + the arcanist&#146;s level. Each day, when preparing spells, the arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 her arcanist level. Any points she had from the previous day are lost. She can also regain these points through the consume spells class feature and some arcanist exploits. The arcane reservoir can never hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this total are lost.</p>
			<p>Points from the arcanist reservoir are used to fuel many of the arcanist&#146;s powers. In addition, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action whenever she casts an arcanist spell. If she does, she can choose to increase the caster level by 1 or increase the spell&#146;s DC by 1. She can expend no more than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.</p>
			<p><b>Arcanist Exploits: </b>By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the arcanist learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic. Some of these exploits allow her to break down various forms of magic, adding their essence to her arcane reservoir. At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the arcanist learns a new arcane exploit selected from the following list. An arcanist exploit cannot be selected more than once. Once an arcanist exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Aura of Good (Ex): </b>A collegiate arcanist radiates an aura of good as if she were a cleric of a level equal to her class level (see the detect good spell).</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Arcanists can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;2. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume spell slots. As with her other spells, these spells are not expended when cast.</p>
			<p><b>Consume Spells (Su): </b>At 1st level, an arcanist can expend an available arcanist spell slot as a move action, making it unavailable for the rest of the day, just as if she had used it to cast a spell. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Doing this adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to the level of the spell slot consumed. She cannot consume cantrips (0 level spells) in this way. Points gained in excess of the reservoir&#146;s maximum are lost.</p>
			<p><b>Halcyon Spell Lore (Su): </b>At each class level, she chooses one spell from the druid spell list or one spell with the good descriptor from the cleric spell list. The spell must be of a spell level that she can cast, and cannot be a spell that already appears on her arcanist spell list. A Collegiate initiate can cast a spell that she has chosen with this ability as if it were on her spell list and prepared by expending a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to half the spell&#146;s level (minimum 1) and expending a spell slot of the spell&#146;s level. At 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a Collegiate initiate can choose to lose a spell that she has chosen with this ability in exchange for a new spell of the same spell level that meets the same requirements.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the arcanist exploits gained at 1st, 9th, and 17th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Spell Mastery: </b>At 5th level, a Collegiate initiate gains Spell Mastery as a bonus feat. Her arcanist levels count as wizard levels for the purpose of satisfying feat prerequisites, both when selecting this bonus feat and when selecting feats gained from character advancement. If she uses her arcanist level to satisfy the prerequisites for Spell Mastery, she can prepare spells selected with this feat as arcanist spells without referring to a spellbook, but not as wizard spells. The Collegiate initiate can also select Spell Mastery as a feat gained from character advancement, allowing her to select the feat multiple times.</p>
			<p>In addition, if the Collegiate initiate gains levels in the collegiate arcanist prestige class, her prestige class levels stack with her arcanist levels when determining the number of points in her arcane reservoir (though not the effectiveness of arcane exploits based on class level). A Collegiate initiate who takes levels in collegiate arcanist and gains the spontaneous spell Mastery class feature can use that ability to instantly lose one of her prepared spells and immediately prepare a different arcanist spell of the same level or lower that she has mastered with Spell Mastery, rather than spontaneous spell mastery&#146;s normal effect. She is still limited to the same number of times per day she can use spontaneous spell mastery.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 5th level.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Exploits: </b>At 11th level and every 2 levels thereafter, an arcanist can choose one of the following greater exploits in place of an arcanist exploit.</p>
			<p><b>Magical Supremacy (Su): </b>At 20th level, the arcanist learns how to convert her arcane reservoir into spells and back again. She can cast any spell she has prepared by expending a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to 1 + the level of the spell to be cast instead of expending a spell slot. When she casts a spell in this fashion, she treats her caster level as 2 higher than normal, and the DCs of any saving throws associated with the spell increase by 2. She cannot further expend points from her arcane reservoir to enhance a spell cast in this way.</p>

At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the arcanist learns a new arcane exploit selected from the following list. An arcanist exploit cannot be selected more than once. Once an arcanist exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p>Not all arcanists peer inward to discern the deepest secrets of magic. Some look outward, connecting with extraplanar creatures and bartering for secrets, power, and favor.</p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some spellcasters seek the secrets of magic, pursuing the power to make the impossible possible. Others are born with magic in their blood, commanding unbelievable forces as effortlessly as they breathe. Yet still others seek to meld the science of arcane scholars with the natural might of innate casters. These arcanists seek to discover the mysterious laws of magic and through will and expertise bend those forces to their whims. Arcanists are the shapers and tinkers of the arcane world, and no magic can resist their control.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Arcanists are scholars of all things magical. They constantly seek out new forms of magic to discover how they work, and in many cases, to collect the energy of such magic for their own uses. Many arcanists are seen as reckless, more concerned with the potency of magic than the ramifications of unleashing such power.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Classes: </b>Sorcerer and wizard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>2d6 x 10 gp (average 70 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Arcanist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Arcanists are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with an arcanist&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail (see Arcane Spells and Armor).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An arcanist casts arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, presented in Chapter 10 of the Core Rulebook. An arcanist must prepare her spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, her spells are not expended when they&#146;re cast. Instead, she can cast any spell that she has prepared consuming a spell slot of the appropriate level, assuming she hasn&#146;t yet used up her spell slots per day for that level.</p>
			<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the arcanist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against an arcanist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An arcanist can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3).</p>
			<p>An arcanist may know any number of spells, but the number she can prepare each day is limited. At 1st level, she can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new arcanist level, the number of spells she can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1&#150;2. Unlike the number of spells she can cast per day, the number of spells an arcanist can prepare each day is not affected by her Intelligence score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster instead affect the number of spells an arcanist can prepare.</p>
			<p>An arcanist must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the arcanist decides what spells to prepare and refreshes her available spell slots for the day.</p>
			<p>Like a sorcerer, an arcanist can choose to apply any metamagic feats she knows to a prepared spell as she casts it, with the same increase in casting time (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook). However, she may also prepare a spell with any metamagic feats she knows and cast it without increasing casting time like a wizard. She cannot combine these options&#151;a spell prepared with metamagic feats cannot be further modified with another metamagic feat at the time of casting (unless she has the metamixing arcanist exploit, detailed below).</p>
			<p><b>Spellbooks: </b>An arcanist must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She can&#146;t prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for read magic (which all arcanists can prepare from memory).</p>
			<p>An arcanist begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard/sorcerer spells plus three 1st-level spells of her choice. The arcanist also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new arcanist level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new arcanist level) for her spellbook. At any time, an arcanist can also add spells found in wizards' or other arcanists' spellbooks to her own (see Arcane Magic Writings).</p>
			<p><b>Arcane Reservoir (Su): </b>An arcanist has an innate pool of magical energy that she can draw upon to fuel her arcanist exploits and enhance her spells. The arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to 3 + the arcanist&#146;s level. Each day, when preparing spells, the arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 her arcanist level. Any points she had from the previous day are lost. She can also regain these points through the consume spells class feature and some arcanist exploits. The arcane reservoir can never hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this total are lost.</p>
			<p>Points from the arcanist reservoir are used to fuel many of the arcanist&#146;s powers. In addition, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action whenever she casts an arcanist spell. If she does, she can choose to increase the caster level by 1 or increase the spell&#146;s DC by 1. She can expend no more than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.</p>
			<p><b>Arcanist Exploits: </b>By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the arcanist learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic. Some of these exploits allow her to break down various forms of magic, adding their essence to her arcane reservoir. At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the arcanist learns a new arcane exploit selected from the following list. An arcanist exploit cannot be selected more than once. Once an arcanist exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Arcanists can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;2. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume spell slots. As with her other spells, these spells are not expended when cast.</p>
			<p><b>Conjurer&#146;s Focus (Sp): </b>An occultist can spend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to cast summon monster I. She can cast this spell as a standard action and the summoned creatures remain for 1 minute per level (instead of 1 round per level). At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the power of this ability increases by one spell level, allowing her to summon more powerful creatures (to a maximum of summon monster IX at 17th level), at the cost of an additional point from her arcane spell reserve per spell level. An occultist cannot have more than one summon monster spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon monster immediately ends. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 1st level.</p>
			<p><b>Consume Spells (Su): </b>At 1st level, an arcanist can expend an available arcanist spell slot as a move action, making it unavailable for the rest of the day, just as if she had used it to cast a spell. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Doing this adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to the level of the spell slot consumed. She cannot consume cantrips (0 level spells) in this way. Points gained in excess of the reservoir&#146;s maximum are lost.</p>
			<p><b>Planar Spells: </b>An occultist adds all planar ally spells to her spell list (using her arcanist level as the cleric level), and treats plane shift as a 5th-level arcanist spell.</p>
			<p><b>Planar Contact (Sp): </b>At 7th level, an occultist can cast augury once per day and contact other plane once per week, using her arcanist level as her caster level. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 7th level.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Exploits: </b>At 11th level and every 2 levels thereafter, an arcanist can choose one of the following greater exploits in place of an arcanist exploit.</p>
			<p><b>Perfect Summoner: </b>At 20th level, an occultist can use her conjurer&#146;s focus without spending points from her arcane reservoir, and the creatures summoned last until dismissed. This ability replaces magical supremacy.</p>

In addition, the arcanist can prepare one additional spell per day of each level she can cast, but this spell must be chosen from the selected school.</p>
					<p>Finally, the arcanist must select two additional schools of magic as her opposition schools. Whenever she prepares spells from one of her opposition schools, the spell takes up two of her prepared spell slots. In addition, a school savant takes a &#150;4 penalty on any skill checks when crafting a magic item that has a spell from one of her opposition schools as a prerequisite. A school savant cannot select the school understanding arcanist exploit. This ability replaces the arcanist exploits gained at 1st, 3rd, and 7th levels.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p>Some arcanists specialize in a school of magic and trade flexibility for focus. School savants are able to prepare more spells per day than typical arcanists, but their selection is more limited.</p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some spellcasters seek the secrets of magic, pursuing the power to make the impossible possible. Others are born with magic in their blood, commanding unbelievable forces as effortlessly as they breathe. Yet still others seek to meld the science of arcane scholars with the natural might of innate casters. These arcanists seek to discover the mysterious laws of magic and through will and expertise bend those forces to their whims. Arcanists are the shapers and tinkers of the arcane world, and no magic can resist their control.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Arcanists are scholars of all things magical. They constantly seek out new forms of magic to discover how they work, and in many cases, to collect the energy of such magic for their own uses. Many arcanists are seen as reckless, more concerned with the potency of magic than the ramifications of unleashing such power.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Classes: </b>Sorcerer and wizard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>2d6 x 10 gp (average 70 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Arcanist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Arcanists are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with an arcanist&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail (see Arcane Spells and Armor).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An arcanist casts arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, presented in Chapter 10 of the Core Rulebook. An arcanist must prepare her spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, her spells are not expended when they&#146;re cast. Instead, she can cast any spell that she has prepared consuming a spell slot of the appropriate level, assuming she hasn&#146;t yet used up her spell slots per day for that level.</p>
			<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the arcanist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against an arcanist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An arcanist can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3).</p>
			<p>An arcanist may know any number of spells, but the number she can prepare each day is limited. At 1st level, she can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new arcanist level, the number of spells she can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1&#150;2. Unlike the number of spells she can cast per day, the number of spells an arcanist can prepare each day is not affected by her Intelligence score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster instead affect the number of spells an arcanist can prepare.</p>
			<p>An arcanist must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the arcanist decides what spells to prepare and refreshes her available spell slots for the day.</p>
			<p>Like a sorcerer, an arcanist can choose to apply any metamagic feats she knows to a prepared spell as she casts it, with the same increase in casting time (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook). However, she may also prepare a spell with any metamagic feats she knows and cast it without increasing casting time like a wizard. She cannot combine these options&#151;a spell prepared with metamagic feats cannot be further modified with another metamagic feat at the time of casting (unless she has the metamixing arcanist exploit, detailed below).</p>
			<p><b>Spellbooks: </b>An arcanist must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She can&#146;t prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for read magic (which all arcanists can prepare from memory).</p>
			<p>An arcanist begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard/sorcerer spells plus three 1st-level spells of her choice. The arcanist also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new arcanist level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new arcanist level) for her spellbook. At any time, an arcanist can also add spells found in wizards' or other arcanists' spellbooks to her own (see Arcane Magic Writings).</p>
			<p><b>Arcane Reservoir (Su): </b>An arcanist has an innate pool of magical energy that she can draw upon to fuel her arcanist exploits and enhance her spells. The arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to 3 + the arcanist&#146;s level. Each day, when preparing spells, the arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 her arcanist level. Any points she had from the previous day are lost. She can also regain these points through the consume spells class feature and some arcanist exploits. The arcane reservoir can never hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this total are lost.</p>
			<p>Points from the arcanist reservoir are used to fuel many of the arcanist&#146;s powers. In addition, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action whenever she casts an arcanist spell. If she does, she can choose to increase the caster level by 1 or increase the spell&#146;s DC by 1. She can expend no more than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.</p>
			<p><b>Arcanist Exploits: </b>By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the arcanist learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic. Some of these exploits allow her to break down various forms of magic, adding their essence to her arcane reservoir. At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the arcanist learns a new arcane exploit selected from the following list. An arcanist exploit cannot be selected more than once. Once an arcanist exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Arcanists can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;2. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume spell slots. As with her other spells, these spells are not expended when cast.</p>
			<p><b>Consume Spells (Su): </b>At 1st level, an arcanist can expend an available arcanist spell slot as a move action, making it unavailable for the rest of the day, just as if she had used it to cast a spell. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Doing this adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to the level of the spell slot consumed. She cannot consume cantrips (0 level spells) in this way. Points gained in excess of the reservoir&#146;s maximum are lost.</p>
			<p><b>School Focus (Su): </b>At 1st level, a school savant chooses a school of magic. The arcanist gains the abilities granted by that school, as the arcane school class feature of the wizard, treating her arcanist level as her wizard level for these abilities. She can also further specialize by selecting a subschool. In addition, the arcanist can prepare one additional spell per day of each level she can cast, but this spell must be chosen from the selected school.</p>
			<p>Finally, the arcanist must select two additional schools of magic as her opposition schools. Whenever she prepares spells from one of her opposition schools, the spell takes up two of her prepared spell slots. In addition, a school savant takes a &#150;4 penalty on any skill checks when crafting a magic item that has a spell from one of her opposition schools as a prerequisite. A school savant cannot select the school understanding arcanist exploit. This ability replaces the arcanist exploits gained at 1st, 3rd, and 7th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Exploits: </b>At 11th level and every 2 levels thereafter, an arcanist can choose one of the following greater exploits in place of an arcanist exploit.</p>
			<p><b>Magical Supremacy (Su): </b>At 20th level, the arcanist learns how to convert her arcane reservoir into spells and back again. She can cast any spell she has prepared by expending a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to 1 + the level of the spell to be cast instead of expending a spell slot. When she casts a spell in this fashion, she treats her caster level as 2 higher than normal, and the DCs of any saving throws associated with the spell increase by 2. She cannot further expend points from her arcane reservoir to enhance a spell cast in this way.</p>

Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>

				<name type="string">Consume Life (Su)</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>By wresting a soul from life to death, a twilight sage gains a slightly deeper understanding of mortality, fueling her curiosity and eldritch power. As a full-round action, she can consume the life energy of a helpless living creature, killing it. This creature must have 2 or more Hit Dice and be below 0 hit points. The twilight sage adds 2 points to her arcane reservoir if the creature&#146;s Hit Dice equaled or exceeded the sage&#146;s character level, or 1 point if the creature&#146;s Hit Dice equaled at least 1/2 her character level. This ability is a death effect. This ability replaces consume spells.</p>

					<p>Arcanists can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;2. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume spell slots. As with her other spells, these spells are not expended when cast.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A twilight sage&#146;s arcane barrier differs from those of other arcanists, as it draws upon both negative and positive energy to protect the sage. At 1st level, a twilight sage must choose the arcane barrier exploit as her first arcanist exploit. Whenever an attack removes the last temporary hit point from the twilight sage&#146;s arcane barrier, the barrier&#146;s negative energy lashes back at the attacker, dealing an amount of negative energy damage equal to the barrier&#146;s maximum temporary hit point capacity. This ability alters the arcanist exploit gained at 1st level.</p>

				<name type="string">Arcane Reservoir (Su)</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>An arcanist has an innate pool of magical energy that she can draw upon to fuel her arcanist exploits and enhance her spells. The arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to 3 + the arcanist&#146;s level. Each day, when preparing spells, the arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 her arcanist level. Any points she had from the previous day are lost. She can also regain these points through the consume spells class feature and some arcanist exploits. The arcane reservoir can never hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this total are lost.</p>
					<p>Points from the arcanist reservoir are used to fuel many of the arcanist&#146;s powers. In addition, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action whenever she casts an arcanist spell. If she does, she can choose to increase the caster level by 1 or increase the spell&#146;s DC by 1. She can expend no more than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.</p>

At each new arcanist level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new arcanist level) for her spellbook.

					<p>At 11th level, a twilight sage&#146;s mastery over life and death allows her to transfer life energy into a fading vessel. Once per day, she can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir while touching a creature that died within the past round to affect that creature as if it had received a breath of life spell, using her arcanist level as the caster level. At the same time, a willing or unconscious living creature within 300 feet that has a number of Hit Dice equal to or greater than the recipient&#146;s instantly dies. This ability is a death effect, and if the victim doesn&#146;t actually die (such as if it was summoned or is immune to death effects), the recipient doesn&#146;t receive the breath of life effect. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 11th level.</p>

					<p>At 20th level, a twilight sage has mastered the relationship between death and arcane power, and has gained a limited ability to surpass her own mortality.

She can still cast spells in this form, using her corpse as the origin point and determining whether she can see or target any creature or area as though she were alive in that square. To cast a spell, she must expend a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to 1 + the spell&#146;s level. The spirit disappears if she has no points remaining in her arcane reservoir or she spends a round without casting a spell. The spirit can&#146;t move, deliver touch or ranged touch spells, or do anything that isn&#146;t part of casting a spell. Her spirit completes the verbal and somatic components of her spells, any material components are consumed from the supply on the corpse, and any focus components must be on the corpse.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p>The twilight sages of Geb carry out experiments to solve the ultimate puzzle and unlock the secrets of life and death. While the twilight sages generally aren&#146;t actively malicious, most are willing to perform human experimentation in pursuit of knowledge with little regard for the casualties.</p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some spellcasters seek the secrets of magic, pursuing the power to make the impossible possible. Others are born with magic in their blood, commanding unbelievable forces as effortlessly as they breathe. Yet still others seek to meld the science of arcane scholars with the natural might of innate casters. These arcanists seek to discover the mysterious laws of magic and through will and expertise bend those forces to their whims. Arcanists are the shapers and tinkers of the arcane world, and no magic can resist their control.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Arcanists are scholars of all things magical. They constantly seek out new forms of magic to discover how they work, and in many cases, to collect the energy of such magic for their own uses. Many arcanists are seen as reckless, more concerned with the potency of magic than the ramifications of unleashing such power.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Classes: </b>Sorcerer and wizard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>2d6 x 10 gp (average 70 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Arcanist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Arcanists are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with an arcanist&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail (see Arcane Spells and Armor).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An arcanist casts arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, presented in Chapter 10 of the Core Rulebook. An arcanist must prepare her spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, her spells are not expended when they&#146;re cast. Instead, she can cast any spell that she has prepared consuming a spell slot of the appropriate level, assuming she hasn&#146;t yet used up her spell slots per day for that level.</p>
			<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the arcanist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against an arcanist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An arcanist can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3).</p>
			<p>An arcanist may know any number of spells, but the number she can prepare each day is limited. At 1st level, she can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new arcanist level, the number of spells she can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1&#150;2. Unlike the number of spells she can cast per day, the number of spells an arcanist can prepare each day is not affected by her Intelligence score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster instead affect the number of spells an arcanist can prepare.</p>
			<p>An arcanist must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the arcanist decides what spells to prepare and refreshes her available spell slots for the day.</p>
			<p>Like a sorcerer, an arcanist can choose to apply any metamagic feats she knows to a prepared spell as she casts it, with the same increase in casting time (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook). However, she may also prepare a spell with any metamagic feats she knows and cast it without increasing casting time like a wizard. She cannot combine these options&#151;a spell prepared with metamagic feats cannot be further modified with another metamagic feat at the time of casting (unless she has the metamixing arcanist exploit, detailed below).</p>
			<p><b>Spellbooks: </b>An arcanist must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She can&#146;t prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for read magic (which all arcanists can prepare from memory).</p>
			<p>An arcanist begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard/sorcerer spells plus three 1st-level spells of her choice. The arcanist also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new arcanist level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new arcanist level) for her spellbook. At any time, an arcanist can also add spells found in wizards' or other arcanists' spellbooks to her own (see Arcane Magic Writings).</p>
			<p><b>Arcane Reservoir (Su): </b>An arcanist has an innate pool of magical energy that she can draw upon to fuel her arcanist exploits and enhance her spells. The arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to 3 + the arcanist&#146;s level. Each day, when preparing spells, the arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 her arcanist level. Any points she had from the previous day are lost. She can also regain these points through the consume spells class feature and some arcanist exploits. The arcane reservoir can never hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this total are lost.</p>
			<p>Points from the arcanist reservoir are used to fuel many of the arcanist&#146;s powers. In addition, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action whenever she casts an arcanist spell. If she does, she can choose to increase the caster level by 1 or increase the spell&#146;s DC by 1. She can expend no more than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.</p>
			<p><b>Arcanist Exploits: </b>By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the arcanist learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic. Some of these exploits allow her to break down various forms of magic, adding their essence to her arcane reservoir. At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the arcanist learns a new arcane exploit selected from the following list. An arcanist exploit cannot be selected more than once. Once an arcanist exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Arcanists can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;2. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume spell slots. As with her other spells, these spells are not expended when cast.</p>
			<p><b>Consume Life (Su): </b>By wresting a soul from life to death, a twilight sage gains a slightly deeper understanding of mortality, fueling her curiosity and eldritch power. As a full-round action, she can consume the life energy of a helpless living creature, killing it. This creature must have 2 or more Hit Dice and be below 0 hit points. The twilight sage adds 2 points to her arcane reservoir if the creature&#146;s Hit Dice equaled or exceeded the sage&#146;s character level, or 1 point if the creature&#146;s Hit Dice equaled at least 1/2 her character level. This ability is a death effect. This ability replaces consume spells.</p>
			<p><b>Necromantic Focus (Ex): </b>Twilight sages consider their research into life and death to be paramount, beyond all other concerns. Each day, a twilight sage must prepare at least one necromancy spell of each spell level she can cast.</p>
			<p><b>Twilight Barrier (Ex): </b>A twilight sage&#146;s arcane barrier differs from those of other arcanists, as it draws upon both negative and positive energy to protect the sage. At 1st level, a twilight sage must choose the arcane barrier exploit as her first arcanist exploit. Whenever an attack removes the last temporary hit point from the twilight sage&#146;s arcane barrier, the barrier&#146;s negative energy lashes back at the attacker, dealing an amount of negative energy damage equal to the barrier&#146;s maximum temporary hit point capacity. This ability alters the arcanist exploit gained at 1st level.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Exploits: </b>At 11th level and every 2 levels thereafter, an arcanist can choose one of the following greater exploits in place of an arcanist exploit.</p>
			<p><b>Magical Supremacy (Su): </b>At 20th level, the arcanist learns how to convert her arcane reservoir into spells and back again. She can cast any spell she has prepared by expending a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to 1 + the level of the spell to be cast instead of expending a spell slot. When she casts a spell in this fashion, she treats her caster level as 2 higher than normal, and the DCs of any saving throws associated with the spell increase by 2. She cannot further expend points from her arcane reservoir to enhance a spell cast in this way.</p>

					<p>An arcanist casts arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, presented in Chapter 10 of the Core Rulebook. An arcanist must prepare her spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, her spells are not expended when they&#146;re cast. Instead, she can cast any spell that she has prepared consuming a spell slot of the appropriate level, assuming she hasn&#146;t yet used up her spell slots per day for that level.</p>
					<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the arcanist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against an arcanist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
					<p>An arcanist can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3).</p>
					<p>An arcanist may know any number of spells, but the number she can prepare each day is limited. At 1st level, she can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new arcanist level, the number of spells she can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1&#150;2. Unlike the number of spells she can cast per day, the number of spells an arcanist can prepare each day is not affected by her Intelligence score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster instead affect the number of spells an arcanist can prepare.</p>
					<p>An arcanist must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the arcanist decides what spells to prepare and refreshes her available spell slots for the day.</p>
					<p>Like a sorcerer, an arcanist can choose to apply any metamagic feats she knows to a prepared spell as she casts it, with the same increase in casting time (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook). However, she may also prepare a spell with any metamagic feats she knows and cast it without increasing casting time like a wizard. She cannot combine these options&#151;a spell prepared with metamagic feats cannot be further modified with another metamagic feat at the time of casting (unless she has the metamixing arcanist exploit, detailed below).</p>

Each day, when preparing spells, the arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 her arcanist level. Any points she had from the previous day are lost. She can also regain these points through the consume spells class feature and some arcanist exploits.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p>Some arcanists store their spells as whispered secrets within familiars instead of on paper.</p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some spellcasters seek the secrets of magic, pursuing the power to make the impossible possible. Others are born with magic in their blood, commanding unbelievable forces as effortlessly as they breathe. Yet still others seek to meld the science of arcane scholars with the natural might of innate casters. These arcanists seek to discover the mysterious laws of magic and through will and expertise bend those forces to their whims. Arcanists are the shapers and tinkers of the arcane world, and no magic can resist their control.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Arcanists are scholars of all things magical. They constantly seek out new forms of magic to discover how they work, and in many cases, to collect the energy of such magic for their own uses. Many arcanists are seen as reckless, more concerned with the potency of magic than the ramifications of unleashing such power.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Classes: </b>Sorcerer and wizard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>2d6 x 10 gp (average 70 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Arcanist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Arcanists are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with an arcanist&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail (see Arcane Spells and Armor).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An arcanist casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list, presented in Chapter 10 of the Core Rulebook. An arcanist must prepare her spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, her spells are not expended when they&#146;re cast. Instead, she can cast any spell that she has prepared consuming a spell slot of the appropriate level, assuming she hasn&#146;t yet used up her spell slots per day for that level.</p>
			<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the arcanist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against an arcanist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An arcanist can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3).</p>
			<p>An arcanist may know any number of spells, but the number she can prepare each day is limited. At 1st level, she can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new arcanist level, the number of spells she can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1&#150;2. Unlike the number of spells she can cast per day, the number of spells an arcanist can prepare each day is not affected by her Intelligence score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster instead affect the number of spells an arcanist can prepare.</p>
			<p>An arcanist must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the arcanist decides what spells to prepare and refreshes her available spell slots for the day.</p>
			<p>Like a sorcerer, an arcanist can choose to apply any metamagic feats she knows to a prepared spell as she casts it, with the same increase in casting time (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook). However, she may also prepare a spell with any metamagic feats she knows and cast it without increasing casting time like a wizard. She cannot combine these options&#151;a spell prepared with metamagic feats cannot be further modified with another metamagic feat at the time of casting (unless she has the metamixing arcanist exploit, detailed below).</p>
			<p><b>Familiar: </b>An unlettered arcanist does not keep a spellbook. Instead, she gains a familiar in which she stores her spells as a witch does, though she does not gain a witch&#146;s patron. Treat her arcanist level as her witch level for determining the abilities and benefits granted by the familiar. Anything that would allow an unlettered arcanist to add spells to her spellbook allows her to add spells to her familiar instead. This ability replaces spellbooks.</p>
			<p><b>Arcane Reservoir (Su): </b>An arcanist has an innate pool of magical energy that she can draw upon to fuel her arcanist exploits and enhance her spells. The arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to 3 + the arcanist&#146;s level. Each day, when preparing spells, the arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 her arcanist level. Any points she had from the previous day are lost. She can also regain these points through the consume spells class feature and some arcanist exploits. The arcane reservoir can never hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this total are lost.</p>
			<p>Points from the arcanist reservoir are used to fuel many of the arcanist&#146;s powers. In addition, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action whenever she casts an arcanist spell. If she does, she can choose to increase the caster level by 1 or increase the spell&#146;s DC by 1. She can expend no more than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.</p>
			<p><b>Arcanist Exploits: </b>By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the arcanist learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic. Some of these exploits allow her to break down various forms of magic, adding their essence to her arcane reservoir. At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the arcanist learns a new arcane exploit selected from the following list. An arcanist exploit cannot be selected more than once. Once an arcanist exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Arcanists can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;2. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume spell slots. As with her other spells, these spells are not expended when cast.</p>
			<p><b>Consume Spells (Su): </b>At 1st level, an arcanist can expend an available arcanist spell slot as a move action, making it unavailable for the rest of the day, just as if she had used it to cast a spell. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Doing this adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to the level of the spell slot consumed. She cannot consume cantrips (0 level spells) in this way. Points gained in excess of the reservoir&#146;s maximum are lost.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Exploits: </b>At 11th level and every 2 levels thereafter, an arcanist can choose one of the following greater exploits in place of an arcanist exploit.</p>
			<p><b>Magical Supremacy (Su): </b>At 20th level, the arcanist learns how to convert her arcane reservoir into spells and back again. She can cast any spell she has prepared by expending a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to 1 + the level of the spell to be cast instead of expending a spell slot. When she casts a spell in this fashion, she treats her caster level as 2 higher than normal, and the DCs of any saving throws associated with the spell increase by 2. She cannot further expend points from her arcane reservoir to enhance a spell cast in this way.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p>A white mage is an arcanist touched by a divine power and gifted with the ability to heal others.</p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Some spellcasters seek the secrets of magic, pursuing the power to make the impossible possible. Others are born with magic in their blood, commanding unbelievable forces as effortlessly as they breathe. Yet still others seek to meld the science of arcane scholars with the natural might of innate casters. These arcanists seek to discover the mysterious laws of magic and through will and expertise bend those forces to their whims. Arcanists are the shapers and tinkers of the arcane world, and no magic can resist their control.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Arcanists are scholars of all things magical. They constantly seek out new forms of magic to discover how they work, and in many cases, to collect the energy of such magic for their own uses. Many arcanists are seen as reckless, more concerned with the potency of magic than the ramifications of unleashing such power.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d6.</p>
			<p><b>Parent Classes: </b>Sorcerer and wizard.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>2d6 x 10 gp (average 70 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Arcanist's class skills are Appraise (Int), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>2 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: </b>Arcanists are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with an arcanist&#146;s gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail (see Arcane Spells and Armor).</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An arcanist casts arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, presented in Chapter 10 of the Core Rulebook. An arcanist must prepare her spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, her spells are not expended when they&#146;re cast. Instead, she can cast any spell that she has prepared consuming a spell slot of the appropriate level, assuming she hasn&#146;t yet used up her spell slots per day for that level.</p>
			<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the arcanist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#146;s level. The saving throw DC against an arcanist&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<p>An arcanist can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1&#150;3).</p>
			<p>An arcanist may know any number of spells, but the number she can prepare each day is limited. At 1st level, she can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new arcanist level, the number of spells she can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1&#150;2. Unlike the number of spells she can cast per day, the number of spells an arcanist can prepare each day is not affected by her Intelligence score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster instead affect the number of spells an arcanist can prepare.</p>
			<p>An arcanist must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the arcanist decides what spells to prepare and refreshes her available spell slots for the day.</p>
			<p>Like a sorcerer, an arcanist can choose to apply any metamagic feats she knows to a prepared spell as she casts it, with the same increase in casting time (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the Core Rulebook). However, she may also prepare a spell with any metamagic feats she knows and cast it without increasing casting time like a wizard. She cannot combine these options&#151;a spell prepared with metamagic feats cannot be further modified with another metamagic feat at the time of casting (unless she has the metamixing arcanist exploit, detailed below).</p>
			<p><b>Spellbooks: </b>An arcanist must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She can&#146;t prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for read magic (which all arcanists can prepare from memory).</p>
			<p>An arcanist begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard/sorcerer spells plus three 1st-level spells of her choice. The arcanist also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new arcanist level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new arcanist level) for her spellbook. At any time, an arcanist can also add spells found in wizards' or other arcanists' spellbooks to her own (see Arcane Magic Writings).</p>
			<p><b>Arcane Reservoir (Su): </b>An arcanist has an innate pool of magical energy that she can draw upon to fuel her arcanist exploits and enhance her spells. The arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to 3 + the arcanist&#146;s level. Each day, when preparing spells, the arcanist&#146;s arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 her arcanist level. Any points she had from the previous day are lost. She can also regain these points through the consume spells class feature and some arcanist exploits. The arcane reservoir can never hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this total are lost.</p>
			<p>Points from the arcanist reservoir are used to fuel many of the arcanist&#146;s powers. In addition, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action whenever she casts an arcanist spell. If she does, she can choose to increase the caster level by 1 or increase the spell&#146;s DC by 1. She can expend no more than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.</p>
			<p><b>Arcanist Exploits: </b>By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the arcanist learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic. Some of these exploits allow her to break down various forms of magic, adding their essence to her arcane reservoir. At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the arcanist learns a new arcane exploit selected from the following list. An arcanist exploit cannot be selected more than once. Once an arcanist exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist&#146;s level + the arcanist&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Cantrips: </b>Arcanists can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1&#150;2. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume spell slots. As with her other spells, these spells are not expended when cast.</p>
			<p><b>Consume Spells (Su): </b>At 1st level, an arcanist can expend an available arcanist spell slot as a move action, making it unavailable for the rest of the day, just as if she had used it to cast a spell. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Doing this adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to the level of the spell slot consumed. She cannot consume cantrips (0 level spells) in this way. Points gained in excess of the reservoir&#146;s maximum are lost.</p>
			<p><b>Spontaneous Healing (Su): </b>At 1st level, a white mage can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to use one of her spell slots to cast a cure spell (any spell with &#147;cure&#148; in its name) from the cleric spell list as if it were on her spell list and prepared. The spell must be of a level the arcanist can cast. At 10th level, the white mage can expend 5 points from her arcane reservoir and a spell slot of at least 5th level to cast breath of life. This ability replaces the arcanist exploits gained at 1st and 9th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Exploits: </b>At 11th level and every 2 levels thereafter, an arcanist can choose one of the following greater exploits in place of an arcanist exploit.</p>
			<p><b>Magical Supremacy (Su): </b>At 20th level, the arcanist learns how to convert her arcane reservoir into spells and back again. She can cast any spell she has prepared by expending a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to 1 + the level of the spell to be cast instead of expending a spell slot. When she casts a spell in this fashion, she treats her caster level as 2 higher than normal, and the DCs of any saving throws associated with the spell increase by 2. She cannot further expend points from her arcane reservoir to enhance a spell cast in this way.</p>
