					<p>At 1st level, a shifter gains her first aspect&#151;a category of animal to which her body and soul have become supernaturally attuned. She can shift into her aspect&#146;s minor form (see Aspects on page 28) for a number of minutes per day equal to 3 + her shifter level. The duration need not be consecutive but must be spent in 1-minute increments. Shifting into a minor form is a swift action, while ending the effect is a free action that can be taken only on the shifter&#146;s turn. Until a shifter reaches 9th level and gains the chimeric aspect class feature, she can assume only one minor form at a time. Shifting to a new aspect (or aspects, in the case of chimeric aspects or greater chimeric aspects) ends all minor forms currently manifested. The minor forms of aspects are not polymorph effects, and the shifter does not lose the benefits of a minor form while affected by polymorph effects.</p>
					<p>As the shifter gains levels, she gains more aspects; she gains her second aspect at 5th level, a third aspect at 10th level, and a fourth at 15th level. Aspects are detailed in their own section starting on page 28.</p>

				<name type="string">Shifter Claws</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At will, a shifter in her natural form can extend her claws as a swift action to use as a weapon. This magical transformation is fueled as much by the shifter&#146;s faith in the natural world as it is by inborn talent. The claws on each hand can be used as a primary natural attack, dealing 1d4 points of piercing and slashing damage (1d3 if she is Small). If she uses one of her claw attacks in concert with a weapon held in the other hand, the claw acts as a secondary natural attack instead.</p>
					<p>As the shifter gains levels, the power of her claws increases. At 3rd level, her claws ignore DR/cold iron, DR/magic, and DR/silver. At 7th level, her claw damage increases to 1d6 (1d4 if Small). At 11th level, her claw damage increases to 1d8 (1d6 if Small). At 13th level, her claw damage increases to 1d10 (1d8 if Small). At 17th level, the damage die does not increase, but the critical multiplier becomes &#215;3. Lastly, at 19th level, the claws ignore DR/adamantine and DR/&#151;.</p>
					<p>While a shifter uses wild shape to assume her aspect&#146;s major form, her natural attacks gain the same benefits granted by her shifter claws ability. If the form she takes has claw attacks, she can use either the base damage of her shifter claws or the damage of the form&#146;s claws, whichever is greater. If the form does not have claw attacks, she can choose up to two natural attacks that would deal less damage than her shifter claw damage and have those attacks instead deal the same damage as her shifter claws.</p>

				<name type="string">Wild Empathy</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A shifter can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 93). The shifter rolls 1d20 and adds her shifter level and Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild empathy, the shifter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another and under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
					<p>The shifter can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>

					<p>At 2nd level, when unarmored, not using a shield, unencumbered, and conscious, the shifter adds her Wisdom bonus (if any) to her AC and CMD. If she is wearing nonmetal armor or using a nonmetal shield, she instead adds half her Wisdom bonus to her AC (minimum 0). In addition, the shifter gains a +1 bonus to her AC and CMD at 4th level.

				<name type="string">Wild Shape</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, a shifter gains the ability to turn herself into the major form of one of her aspects and back again. This ability functions as beast shape II, except as noted here. The shifter can turn into the major form of only one of her aspects at a time. Using wild shape to change to a major form or back is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke attacks of opportunity. Often a particular aspect&#146;s major form grants abilities beyond the normal effect of beast shape II. Each major form details the abilities the shifter gains with that major form and at what level; she gains these instead of the form abilities from beast shape II, but she still gains beast shape II abilities that are size dependent.</p>
					<p>A shifter loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal of that form can make, but she can communicate with other animals of the same general grouping as her form. She can also communicate in nonverbal ways with allies.</p>
					<p>A shifter can use wild shape for a number of hours each day equal to her shifter level + her Wisdom modifier. It need not be consecutive but must be spent in 1 hour increments. For abilities that function based on &#145;uses of wild shape,&#146; each hour of wild shape counts as a use.</p>
					<p>A shifters can take feats and other abilities that require wild shape; for the purpose of qualifying for prerequisites, her effective druid level is equal to her shifter level.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>-</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether riding on the wind as a falcon or hiding in some fetid bog waiting to strike, the shifter is a true master of the wild. Both a devoted defender of druidic circles and a fierce predator, the shifter can take on the forms of nature and even fuse them together with devastating effect and unbridled savagery. By way of the druidic discipline of wild shape, they become living aspects of the wild. At first, they are able to assume only a minor aspect, but with time and practice they can fully transform into ever more powerful forms.</p>
			<p>The shifter class offers players a way to experience a shapeshifting character that is more martially inclined than a spellcasting druid. With each new level, the shifter&#146;s powers grow in new and surprising ways, creating a character that thrives in battle, exploration, and stealth.</p>
			<p>Shifters are protectors of druidic circles and avengers of nature, yet a shifter&#146;s magic is different from that of her druidic kin. Rather than invoking spells from the natural world or forging alliances with animals, shifters focus their supernatural powers inward to gain control over their own forms. Their ability to change their forms is as varied as the wonders of the wilds themselves but always remains at least partially rooted in the natural world. There are many paths to becoming a shifter; most are trained in that role by druidic circles and have their powers unlocked via rituals of initiation. Yet some stumble upon the gift naturally, as if their blood bore the secrets of shifter transformation.</p>
			<p>For those leaning toward the causes of law and good, the path of the shifter is one of contemplation and understanding. They become one with nature through mental and physical mimicry and gain an ever deeper spiritual understanding of the ebb and flow of the natural world. Those leaning toward the chaotic and evil teachings of druidic philosophy find such enlightenment through more violent means. These are typically quicker transformations, both brutal and painful, imparting the dark lessons of nature through its most catastrophic forms. Shifters who lean toward true neutrality are the most diverse when it comes to their command of metamorphic secrets.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The shifter is so attuned to nature and the wild beasts of the world that she can call upon those powers to mystically fortify her being. Fluid in form and function, she can shape herself to overcome hardships and support those she befriends or serves.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any neutral.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p>S <b>tarting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shifter's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Shifter Aspect (Su): </b>At 1st level, a shifter gains her first aspect&#151;a category of animal to which her body and soul have become supernaturally attuned. She can shift into her aspect&#146;s minor form (see Aspects on page 28) for a number of minutes per day equal to 3 + her shifter level. The duration need not be consecutive but must be spent in 1-minute increments. Shifting into a minor form is a swift action, while ending the effect is a free action that can be taken only on the shifter&#146;s turn. Until a shifter reaches 9th level and gains the chimeric aspect class feature, she can assume only one minor form at a time. Shifting to a new aspect (or aspects, in the case of chimeric aspects or greater chimeric aspects) ends all minor forms currently manifested. The minor forms of aspects are not polymorph effects, and the shifter does not lose the benefits of a minor form while affected by polymorph effects.</p>
			<p>As the shifter gains levels, she gains more aspects; she gains her second aspect at 5th level, a third aspect at 10th level, and a fourth at 15th level. Aspects are detailed in their own section starting on page 28.</p>
			<p><b>Shifter Claws (Su): </b>At will, a shifter in her natural form can extend her claws as a swift action to use as a weapon. This magical transformation is fueled as much by the shifter&#146;s faith in the natural world as it is by inborn talent. The claws on each hand can be used as a primary natural attack, dealing 1d4 points of piercing and slashing damage (1d3 if she is Small). If she uses one of her claw attacks in concert with a weapon held in the other hand, the claw acts as a secondary natural attack instead.</p>
			<p>As the shifter gains levels, the power of her claws increases. At 3rd level, her claws ignore DR/cold iron, DR/magic, and DR/silver. At 7th level, her claw damage increases to 1d6 (1d4 if Small). At 11th level, her claw damage increases to 1d8 (1d6 if Small). At 13th level, her claw damage increases to 1d10 (1d8 if Small). At 17th level, the damage die does not increase, but the critical multiplier becomes &#215;3. Lastly, at 19th level, the claws ignore DR/adamantine and DR/&#151;.</p>
			<p>While a shifter uses wild shape to assume her aspect&#146;s major form, her natural attacks gain the same benefits granted by her shifter claws ability. If the form she takes has claw attacks, she can use either the base damage of her shifter claws or the damage of the form&#146;s claws, whichever is greater. If the form does not have claw attacks, she can choose up to two natural attacks that would deal less damage than her shifter claw damage and have those attacks instead deal the same damage as her shifter claws.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A shifter can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 93). The shifter rolls 1d20 and adds her shifter level and Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild empathy, the shifter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another and under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The shifter can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Defensive Instinct (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, when unarmored, not using a shield, unencumbered, and conscious, the shifter adds her Wisdom bonus (if any) to her AC and CMD. If she is wearing nonmetal armor or using a nonmetal shield, she instead adds half her Wisdom bonus to her AC (minimum 0). In addition, the shifter gains a +1 bonus to her AC and CMD at 4th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 shifter levels thereafter (up to a maximum of +5 at 20th level).</p>
			<p>These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks and when the shifter is flatfooted. She loses these bonuses when she is immobilized or helpless. These bonuses do not stack with the monk AC bonus class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a shifter adds half her level as a bonus on Survival checks to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a shifter can move through any sort of undergrowth (such as briars, natural thorns, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Briars, thorns, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion still affect the shifter.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su): </b>At 4th level, a shifter gains the ability to turn herself into the major form of one of her aspects and back again. This ability functions as beast shape II, except as noted here. The shifter can turn into the major form of only one of her aspects at a time. Using wild shape to change to a major form or back is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke attacks of opportunity. Often a particular aspect&#146;s major form grants abilities beyond the normal effect of beast shape II. Each major form details the abilities the shifter gains with that major form and at what level; she gains these instead of the form abilities from beast shape II, but she still gains beast shape II abilities that are size dependent.</p>
			<p>A shifter loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal of that form can make, but she can communicate with other animals of the same general grouping as her form. She can also communicate in nonverbal ways with allies.</p>
			<p>A shifter can use wild shape for a number of hours each day equal to her shifter level + her Wisdom modifier. It need not be consecutive but must be spent in 1 hour increments. For abilities that function based on &#145;uses of wild shape,&#146; each hour of wild shape counts as a use.</p>
			<p>A shifters can take feats and other abilities that require wild shape; for the purpose of qualifying for prerequisites, her effective druid level is equal to her shifter level.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a shifter leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She can choose to leave a trail if she so desires.</p>
			<p><b>Shifter&#146;s Fury (Ex): </b>At level 6, a shifter gains the ability to make several ferocious attacks with the same natural weapon. Instead of attacking with all her natural weapons, the shifter can choose a single natural weapon and make a full attack with that natural weapon, gaining a second iterative attack at a &#150;5 as if it was a manufactured weapon. When she does so, all her other natural attacks count as secondary attacks and don&#146;t benefit from shifter&#146;s claws. At 11th level, she gains a third iterative attack at a &#150;10 and at 16th level, she gains a fourth iterative attack at &#150;15.</p>
			<p><b>Chimeric Aspect (Su): </b>At 9th level, when a shifter uses her shifter aspect ability to take on a minor form, she can choose two aspects and assume the minor form of each aspect.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Chimeric Aspect (Su): </b>At 14th level, when a shifter uses her shifter aspect ability to take on a minor form, she can choose up to three aspects and assume the minor form of each aspect.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su): </b>At 18th level, a shifter gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the alter self spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 18th level, a shifter no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the shifter still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>
			<p><b>Final Aspect (Su): </b>At 20th level, a shifter gains access to a fifth aspect, and when she uses shifter&#146;s aspect, she can assume the minor forms of all her aspects and the shifter can use her major and minor forms at will.</p>
			<h>Speaking Druidic</h>
			<p>For the purposes of teaching and learning the Druidic language, shifters are considered to be druids&#151;the nuances of the language are instrumental in teaching characters of both classes to use and control their abilities. While the rare druidic circle might bar shifters from its order, and while some eccentric shifters may view druids as competitors or even enemies, all shifters are assumed to speak it.</p>
			<h>Ex-Shifters</h>
			<p>A shifter who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a non-druid or a non-shifter loses all her supernatural abilities. She cannot thereafter gain levels as a shifter until she atones (see the atonement spell description on page 245 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<h>Alternate Natural Attacks</h>
			<p>A shifter can draw on her chosen animal aspect to transform her hands into deadly weapons, as represented by the shifter&#146;s claws class feature, but not every animal has prominent claws. The following list provides alternate natural attacks for the shifter claws class feature. Each time the shifter activates her shifter&#146;s claws ability in her natural form, she can manifest one of the alternate natural attacks listed below for any of her chosen aspects, or those that relate to her archetype. Each alternate natural attack replaces one of the shifter&#146;s claw attacks. The shifter can gain up to two different alternate natural attacks with this method. These alternate natural attacks modify only the damage type of the shifter&#146;s natural attacks and otherwise function exactly as the shifter claws class feature.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A wild effigy still takes on the shapes of natural animals, but rather than transforming her body into flesh and muscle, she transforms into constructed effigies of her chosen aspects.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether riding on the wind as a falcon or hiding in some fetid bog waiting to strike, the shifter is a true master of the wild. Both a devoted defender of druidic circles and a fierce predator, the shifter can take on the forms of nature and even fuse them together with devastating effect and unbridled savagery. By way of the druidic discipline of wild shape, they become living aspects of the wild. At first, they are able to assume only a minor aspect, but with time and practice they can fully transform into ever more powerful forms.</p>
			<p>The shifter class offers players a way to experience a shapeshifting character that is more martially inclined than a spellcasting druid. With each new level, the shifter&#146;s powers grow in new and surprising ways, creating a character that thrives in battle, exploration, and stealth.</p>
			<p>Shifters are protectors of druidic circles and avengers of nature, yet a shifter&#146;s magic is different from that of her druidic kin. Rather than invoking spells from the natural world or forging alliances with animals, shifters focus their supernatural powers inward to gain control over their own forms. Their ability to change their forms is as varied as the wonders of the wilds themselves but always remains at least partially rooted in the natural world. There are many paths to becoming a shifter; most are trained in that role by druidic circles and have their powers unlocked via rituals of initiation. Yet some stumble upon the gift naturally, as if their blood bore the secrets of shifter transformation.</p>
			<p>For those leaning toward the causes of law and good, the path of the shifter is one of contemplation and understanding. They become one with nature through mental and physical mimicry and gain an ever deeper spiritual understanding of the ebb and flow of the natural world. Those leaning toward the chaotic and evil teachings of druidic philosophy find such enlightenment through more violent means. These are typically quicker transformations, both brutal and painful, imparting the dark lessons of nature through its most catastrophic forms. Shifters who lean toward true neutrality are the most diverse when it comes to their command of metamorphic secrets.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The shifter is so attuned to nature and the wild beasts of the world that she can call upon those powers to mystically fortify her being. Fluid in form and function, she can shape herself to overcome hardships and support those she befriends or serves.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any neutral.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p>S <b>tarting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shifter's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A shifter is proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. She is also proficient with the natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) from the shifter claws class feature and of forms she assumes with wild shape.</p>
			<p>Shifters are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor. A shifter can wear wooden armor that has been altered by the ironwood spell so that it functions as if it were steel. Shifters are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A shifter who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to use her shifter aspect, shifter claws, wild shape, and other shifter supernatural or spell-like abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Armor Plating (Su): </b>A wild effigy&#146;s animal aspects are made out of carved, living rock. When a wild effigy is shifted into one of her minor or major aspects, she gains a +1 enhancement bonus to natural armor and gains DR adamantine equal to half her shifter level (minimum 1). The enahncement increases by 1 at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. At 6th level, these bonuses also apply when the wild effigy is transformed into one of her aspects using wild shape.</p>
			<p>This replaces wild empathy, track, woodland stride, and trackless step.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages: </b>A shifter&#146;s bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures, and Aklo, the tongue spoken by certain sinister fey or otherworldly denizens of reaches of the wild rarely explored by humanity. These choices are in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A shifter speaks Druidic, a secret language known only to druids and shifters, which she learns upon becoming a 1stlevel shifter. Druidic is a free language for a shifter; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages, and it doesn&#146;t take up a language slot. Shifters are forbidden to teach this language to non-druids or non-shifters.</p>
			<p><b>Shifter Aspect (Su): </b>At 1st level, a shifter gains her first aspect&#151;a category of animal to which her body and soul have become supernaturally attuned. She can shift into her aspect&#146;s minor form (see Aspects on page 28) for a number of minutes per day equal to 3 + her shifter level. The duration need not be consecutive but must be spent in 1-minute increments. Shifting into a minor form is a swift action, while ending the effect is a free action that can be taken only on the shifter&#146;s turn. Until a shifter reaches 9th level and gains the chimeric aspect class feature, she can assume only one minor form at a time. Shifting to a new aspect (or aspects, in the case of chimeric aspects or greater chimeric aspects) ends all minor forms currently manifested. The minor forms of aspects are not polymorph effects, and the shifter does not lose the benefits of a minor form while affected by polymorph effects.</p>
			<p>As the shifter gains levels, she gains more aspects; she gains her second aspect at 5th level, a third aspect at 10th level, and a fourth at 15th level. Aspects are detailed in their own section starting on page 28.</p>
			<p><b>Shifter Claws (Su): </b>At will, a shifter in her natural form can extend her claws as a swift action to use as a weapon. This magical transformation is fueled as much by the shifter&#146;s faith in the natural world as it is by inborn talent. The claws on each hand can be used as a primary natural attack, dealing 1d4 points of piercing and slashing damage (1d3 if she is Small). If she uses one of her claw attacks in concert with a weapon held in the other hand, the claw acts as a secondary natural attack instead.</p>
			<p>As the shifter gains levels, the power of her claws increases. At 3rd level, her claws ignore DR/cold iron, DR/magic, and DR/silver. At 7th level, her claw damage increases to 1d6 (1d4 if Small). At 11th level, her claw damage increases to 1d8 (1d6 if Small). At 13th level, her claw damage increases to 1d10 (1d8 if Small). At 17th level, the damage die does not increase, but the critical multiplier becomes &#215;3. Lastly, at 19th level, the claws ignore DR/adamantine and DR/&#151;.</p>
			<p>While a shifter uses wild shape to assume her aspect&#146;s major form, her natural attacks gain the same benefits granted by her shifter claws ability. If the form she takes has claw attacks, she can use either the base damage of her shifter claws or the damage of the form&#146;s claws, whichever is greater. If the form does not have claw attacks, she can choose up to two natural attacks that would deal less damage than her shifter claw damage and have those attacks instead deal the same damage as her shifter claws.</p>
			<p><b>Heart of Earth (Su): </b>At 4th level, a wild effigy&#146;s stone aspects no longer require even the semblance of flesh and blood to function. When a wild effigy is shifted into a minor or major aspect, or is transformed into one of her aspects using wild shape, she adds her shifter level on checks to stabilize at negative hit points and gains a 25% chance to ignore a critical hit or precision damage. This does not stack with the fortification armor property or similar effects.</p>
			<p>At 9th level, this chance increases to 50% and she becomes immune to petrification.</p>
			<p>At 15th level, this chance increases to 75% and she becomes immune to bleed and blood drain effects.</p>
			<p>This replaces defensive instinct.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su): </b>At 4th level, a shifter gains the ability to turn herself into the major form of one of her aspects and back again. This ability functions as beast shape II, except as noted here. The shifter can turn into the major form of only one of her aspects at a time. Using wild shape to change to a major form or back is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke attacks of opportunity. Often a particular aspect&#146;s major form grants abilities beyond the normal effect of beast shape II. Each major form details the abilities the shifter gains with that major form and at what level; she gains these instead of the form abilities from beast shape II, but she still gains beast shape II abilities that are size dependent.</p>
			<p>A shifter loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal of that form can make, but she can communicate with other animals of the same general grouping as her form. She can also communicate in nonverbal ways with allies.</p>
			<p>A shifter can use wild shape for a number of hours each day equal to her shifter level + her Wisdom modifier. It need not be consecutive but must be spent in 1 hour increments. For abilities that function based on &#145;uses of wild shape,&#146; each hour of wild shape counts as a use.</p>
			<p>A shifters can take feats and other abilities that require wild shape; for the purpose of qualifying for prerequisites, her effective druid level is equal to her shifter level.</p>
			<p><b>Shifter&#146;s Fury (Ex): </b>At level 6, a shifter gains the ability to make several ferocious attacks with the same natural weapon. Instead of attacking with all her natural weapons, the shifter can choose a single natural weapon and make a full attack with that natural weapon, gaining a second iterative attack at a &#150;5 as if it was a manufactured weapon. When she does so, all her other natural attacks count as secondary attacks and don&#146;t benefit from shifter&#146;s claws. At 11th level, she gains a third iterative attack at a &#150;10 and at 16th level, she gains a fourth iterative attack at &#150;15.</p>
			<p><b>Stoneclaw Strike (Su): </b>At 6th level, a wild effigy can sacrifice minutes from her aspects&#146; minor forms to turn her claws into adamantine. By expending a 1-minute increment of her shifter&#146;s minor aspect ability as a swift action, she can grant her shifter&#146;s claws the ability to ignore an amount of DR or hardness equal to her shifter level for 1 minute. The wild effigy can use this ability 3 times per day.</p>
			<p><b>Chimeric Aspect (Su): </b>At 9th level, when a shifter uses her shifter aspect ability to take on a minor form, she can choose two aspects and assume the minor form of each aspect.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Chimeric Aspect (Su): </b>At 14th level, when a shifter uses her shifter aspect ability to take on a minor form, she can choose up to three aspects and assume the minor form of each aspect.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su): </b>At 18th level, a shifter gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the alter self spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 18th level, a shifter no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the shifter still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>
			<p><b>Final Aspect (Su): </b>At 20th level, a shifter gains access to a fifth aspect, and when she uses shifter&#146;s aspect, she can assume the minor forms of all her aspects and the shifter can use her major and minor forms at will.</p>
			<h>Speaking Druidic</h>
			<p>For the purposes of teaching and learning the Druidic language, shifters are considered to be druids&#151;the nuances of the language are instrumental in teaching characters of both classes to use and control their abilities. While the rare druidic circle might bar shifters from its order, and while some eccentric shifters may view druids as competitors or even enemies, all shifters are assumed to speak it.</p>
			<h>Ex-Shifters</h>
			<p>A shifter who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a non-druid or a non-shifter loses all her supernatural abilities. She cannot thereafter gain levels as a shifter until she atones (see the atonement spell description on page 245 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<h>Alternate Natural Attacks</h>
			<p>A shifter can draw on her chosen animal aspect to transform her hands into deadly weapons, as represented by the shifter&#146;s claws class feature, but not every animal has prominent claws. The following list provides alternate natural attacks for the shifter claws class feature. Each time the shifter activates her shifter&#146;s claws ability in her natural form, she can manifest one of the alternate natural attacks listed below for any of her chosen aspects, or those that relate to her archetype. Each alternate natural attack replaces one of the shifter&#146;s claw attacks. The shifter can gain up to two different alternate natural attacks with this method. These alternate natural attacks modify only the damage type of the shifter&#146;s natural attacks and otherwise function exactly as the shifter claws class feature.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A shifter can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 93). The shifter rolls 1d20 and adds her shifter level and Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild empathy, the shifter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another and under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
					<p>The shifter can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Weretouched shifters are scions of lycanthropic forces, whether hereditary or supernaturally imposed. They can assume both animal and hybrid forms, as a lycanthrope does.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether riding on the wind as a falcon or hiding in some fetid bog waiting to strike, the shifter is a true master of the wild. Both a devoted defender of druidic circles and a fierce predator, the shifter can take on the forms of nature and even fuse them together with devastating effect and unbridled savagery. By way of the druidic discipline of wild shape, they become living aspects of the wild. At first, they are able to assume only a minor aspect, but with time and practice they can fully transform into ever more powerful forms.</p>
			<p>The shifter class offers players a way to experience a shapeshifting character that is more martially inclined than a spellcasting druid. With each new level, the shifter&#146;s powers grow in new and surprising ways, creating a character that thrives in battle, exploration, and stealth.</p>
			<p>Shifters are protectors of druidic circles and avengers of nature, yet a shifter&#146;s magic is different from that of her druidic kin. Rather than invoking spells from the natural world or forging alliances with animals, shifters focus their supernatural powers inward to gain control over their own forms. Their ability to change their forms is as varied as the wonders of the wilds themselves but always remains at least partially rooted in the natural world. There are many paths to becoming a shifter; most are trained in that role by druidic circles and have their powers unlocked via rituals of initiation. Yet some stumble upon the gift naturally, as if their blood bore the secrets of shifter transformation.</p>
			<p>For those leaning toward the causes of law and good, the path of the shifter is one of contemplation and understanding. They become one with nature through mental and physical mimicry and gain an ever deeper spiritual understanding of the ebb and flow of the natural world. Those leaning toward the chaotic and evil teachings of druidic philosophy find such enlightenment through more violent means. These are typically quicker transformations, both brutal and painful, imparting the dark lessons of nature through its most catastrophic forms. Shifters who lean toward true neutrality are the most diverse when it comes to their command of metamorphic secrets.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The shifter is so attuned to nature and the wild beasts of the world that she can call upon those powers to mystically fortify her being. Fluid in form and function, she can shape herself to overcome hardships and support those she befriends or serves.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any neutral.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p>S <b>tarting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shifter's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A shifter is proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. She is also proficient with the natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) from the shifter claws class feature and of forms she assumes with wild shape.</p>
			<p>Shifters are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor. A shifter can wear wooden armor that has been altered by the ironwood spell so that it functions as if it were steel. Shifters are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A shifter who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to use her shifter aspect, shifter claws, wild shape, and other shifter supernatural or spell-like abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages: </b>A shifter&#146;s bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures, and Aklo, the tongue spoken by certain sinister fey or otherworldly denizens of reaches of the wild rarely explored by humanity. These choices are in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A shifter speaks Druidic, a secret language known only to druids and shifters, which she learns upon becoming a 1stlevel shifter. Druidic is a free language for a shifter; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages, and it doesn&#146;t take up a language slot. Shifters are forbidden to teach this language to non-druids or non-shifters.</p>
			<p><b>Lycanthrope Aspect (Su): </b>At 1st level, a weretouched gains the shifter aspect ability, except the animal aspect chosen is the only animal aspect the weretouched can gain. This alters her other class features, as detailed in each relevant class feature. Otherwise, this ability functions identically to shifter aspect.</p>
			<p>At 5th level, a weretouched gains DR/silver equal to half her shifter level, to a maximum of DR 10/silver at 20th level. Additionally, a weretouched shifter becomes immune to a lycanthrope&#146;s curse of lycanthropy.</p>
			<p>This alters shifter aspect and all of its improvements.</p>
			<p><b>Lycanthropic Empathy (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a weretouched gains wild empathy and a +4 bonus on wild empathy checks, but this ability works only on the type of animal she chose for her lycanthrope aspect.</p>
			<p>This alters wild empathy.</p>
			<p><b>Shifter Aspect (Su): </b>At 1st level, a shifter gains her first aspect&#151;a category of animal to which her body and soul have become supernaturally attuned. She can shift into her aspect&#146;s minor form (see Aspects on page 28) for a number of minutes per day equal to 3 + her shifter level. The duration need not be consecutive but must be spent in 1-minute increments. Shifting into a minor form is a swift action, while ending the effect is a free action that can be taken only on the shifter&#146;s turn. Until a shifter reaches 9th level and gains the chimeric aspect class feature, she can assume only one minor form at a time. Shifting to a new aspect (or aspects, in the case of chimeric aspects or greater chimeric aspects) ends all minor forms currently manifested. The minor forms of aspects are not polymorph effects, and the shifter does not lose the benefits of a minor form while affected by polymorph effects.</p>
			<p>As the shifter gains levels, she gains more aspects; she gains her second aspect at 5th level, a third aspect at 10th level, and a fourth at 15th level. Aspects are detailed in their own section starting on page 28.</p>
			<p><b>Shifter Claws (Su): </b>At will, a shifter in her natural form can extend her claws as a swift action to use as a weapon. This magical transformation is fueled as much by the shifter&#146;s faith in the natural world as it is by inborn talent. The claws on each hand can be used as a primary natural attack, dealing 1d4 points of piercing and slashing damage (1d3 if she is Small). If she uses one of her claw attacks in concert with a weapon held in the other hand, the claw acts as a secondary natural attack instead.</p>
			<p>As the shifter gains levels, the power of her claws increases. At 3rd level, her claws ignore DR/cold iron, DR/magic, and DR/silver. At 7th level, her claw damage increases to 1d6 (1d4 if Small). At 11th level, her claw damage increases to 1d8 (1d6 if Small). At 13th level, her claw damage increases to 1d10 (1d8 if Small). At 17th level, the damage die does not increase, but the critical multiplier becomes &#215;3. Lastly, at 19th level, the claws ignore DR/adamantine and DR/&#151;.</p>
			<p>While a shifter uses wild shape to assume her aspect&#146;s major form, her natural attacks gain the same benefits granted by her shifter claws ability. If the form she takes has claw attacks, she can use either the base damage of her shifter claws or the damage of the form&#146;s claws, whichever is greater. If the form does not have claw attacks, she can choose up to two natural attacks that would deal less damage than her shifter claw damage and have those attacks instead deal the same damage as her shifter claws.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A shifter can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 93). The shifter rolls 1d20 and adds her shifter level and Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild empathy, the shifter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another and under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The shifter can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Defensive Instinct (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, when unarmored, not using a shield, unencumbered, and conscious, the shifter adds her Wisdom bonus (if any) to her AC and CMD. If she is wearing nonmetal armor or using a nonmetal shield, she instead adds half her Wisdom bonus to her AC (minimum 0). In addition, the shifter gains a +1 bonus to her AC and CMD at 4th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 shifter levels thereafter (up to a maximum of +5 at 20th level).</p>
			<p>These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks and when the shifter is flatfooted. She loses these bonuses when she is immobilized or helpless. These bonuses do not stack with the monk AC bonus class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a shifter adds half her level as a bonus on Survival checks to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a shifter can move through any sort of undergrowth (such as briars, natural thorns, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Briars, thorns, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion still affect the shifter.</p>
			<p><b>Lycanthropic Wild Shape (Su): </b>At 4th level, when a weretouched uses wild shape, she can assume only the form of an animal of the same type as her lycanthrope aspect. However, instead of assuming a major form, she can assume a hybrid form that mixes the traits of her natural form and the major form of her aspect. While in a hybrid form, she gain a +2 size bonus to her Strength score, a +2 natural armor bonus to her AC, and all of the natural attacks and abilities listed by her major form. A weretouched also counts as being in her natural form for the purpose of determining whether she can extend her shifter claws. A weretouched&#146;s hybrid form is roughly the same size and shape as her natural form, albeit with bestial qualities such as digitigrade legs or shaggy fur, so her equipment does not merge into her new form when she shifts between her natural form and hybrid form. In addition, the size of a weretouched&#146;s hybrid form is the same as the size of her natural form. This otherwise counts as assuming a major form using wild shape.</p>
			<p>This alters wild shape.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su): </b>At 4th level, a shifter gains the ability to turn herself into the major form of one of her aspects and back again. This ability functions as beast shape II, except as noted here. The shifter can turn into the major form of only one of her aspects at a time. Using wild shape to change to a major form or back is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke attacks of opportunity. Often a particular aspect&#146;s major form grants abilities beyond the normal effect of beast shape II. Each major form details the abilities the shifter gains with that major form and at what level; she gains these instead of the form abilities from beast shape II, but she still gains beast shape II abilities that are size dependent.</p>
			<p>A shifter loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal of that form can make, but she can communicate with other animals of the same general grouping as her form. She can also communicate in nonverbal ways with allies.</p>
			<p>A shifter can use wild shape for a number of hours each day equal to her shifter level + her Wisdom modifier. It need not be consecutive but must be spent in 1 hour increments. For abilities that function based on &#145;uses of wild shape,&#146; each hour of wild shape counts as a use.</p>
			<p>A shifters can take feats and other abilities that require wild shape; for the purpose of qualifying for prerequisites, her effective druid level is equal to her shifter level.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a shifter leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She can choose to leave a trail if she so desires.</p>
			<p><b>Shifter&#146;s Fury (Ex): </b>At level 6, a shifter gains the ability to make several ferocious attacks with the same natural weapon. Instead of attacking with all her natural weapons, the shifter can choose a single natural weapon and make a full attack with that natural weapon, gaining a second iterative attack at a &#150;5 as if it was a manufactured weapon. When she does so, all her other natural attacks count as secondary attacks and don&#146;t benefit from shifter&#146;s claws. At 11th level, she gains a third iterative attack at a &#150;10 and at 16th level, she gains a fourth iterative attack at &#150;15.</p>
			<p><b>Chimeric Aspect (Su): </b>At 9th level, when a shifter uses her shifter aspect ability to take on a minor form, she can choose two aspects and assume the minor form of each aspect.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Chimeric Aspect (Su): </b>At 14th level, when a shifter uses her shifter aspect ability to take on a minor form, she can choose up to three aspects and assume the minor form of each aspect.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su): </b>At 18th level, a shifter gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the alter self spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 18th level, a shifter no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the shifter still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>
			<p><b>Final Aspect (Su): </b>At 20th level, a shifter gains access to a fifth aspect, and when she uses shifter&#146;s aspect, she can assume the minor forms of all her aspects and the shifter can use her major and minor forms at will.</p>
			<h>Speaking Druidic</h>
			<p>For the purposes of teaching and learning the Druidic language, shifters are considered to be druids&#151;the nuances of the language are instrumental in teaching characters of both classes to use and control their abilities. While the rare druidic circle might bar shifters from its order, and while some eccentric shifters may view druids as competitors or even enemies, all shifters are assumed to speak it.</p>
			<h>Ex-Shifters</h>
			<p>A shifter who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a non-druid or a non-shifter loses all her supernatural abilities. She cannot thereafter gain levels as a shifter until she atones (see the atonement spell description on page 245 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<h>Alternate Natural Attacks</h>
			<p>A shifter can draw on her chosen animal aspect to transform her hands into deadly weapons, as represented by the shifter&#146;s claws class feature, but not every animal has prominent claws. The following list provides alternate natural attacks for the shifter claws class feature. Each time the shifter activates her shifter&#146;s claws ability in her natural form, she can manifest one of the alternate natural attacks listed below for any of her chosen aspects, or those that relate to her archetype. Each alternate natural attack replaces one of the shifter&#146;s claw attacks. The shifter can gain up to two different alternate natural attacks with this method. These alternate natural attacks modify only the damage type of the shifter&#146;s natural attacks and otherwise function exactly as the shifter claws class feature.</p>

				<name type="string">Shifter Claws</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At will, a shifter in her natural form can extend her claws as a swift action to use as a weapon. This magical transformation is fueled as much by the shifter&#146;s faith in the natural world as it is by inborn talent. The claws on each hand can be used as a primary natural attack, dealing 1d4 points of piercing and slashing damage (1d3 if she is Small). If she uses one of her claw attacks in concert with a weapon held in the other hand, the claw acts as a secondary natural attack instead.</p>
					<p>As the shifter gains levels, the power of her claws increases. At 3rd level, her claws ignore DR/cold iron, DR/magic, and DR/silver. At 7th level, her claw damage increases to 1d6 (1d4 if Small). At 11th level, her claw damage increases to 1d8 (1d6 if Small). At 13th level, her claw damage increases to 1d10 (1d8 if Small). At 17th level, the damage die does not increase, but the critical multiplier becomes &#215;3. Lastly, at 19th level, the claws ignore DR/adamantine and DR/&#151;.</p>
					<p>While a shifter uses wild shape to assume her aspect&#146;s major form, her natural attacks gain the same benefits granted by her shifter claws ability. If the form she takes has claw attacks, she can use either the base damage of her shifter claws or the damage of the form&#146;s claws, whichever is greater. If the form does not have claw attacks, she can choose up to two natural attacks that would deal less damage than her shifter claw damage and have those attacks instead deal the same damage as her shifter claws.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Verdant shifters have an affinity for plants rather than animals and gain a plantlike form that grows in power as they do. Verdant shifters are the enemies of creatures that would despoil the natural world, and they seek to maintain balance with civilization and industry to ensure the sanctity of wild spaces.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether riding on the wind as a falcon or hiding in some fetid bog waiting to strike, the shifter is a true master of the wild. Both a devoted defender of druidic circles and a fierce predator, the shifter can take on the forms of nature and even fuse them together with devastating effect and unbridled savagery. By way of the druidic discipline of wild shape, they become living aspects of the wild. At first, they are able to assume only a minor aspect, but with time and practice they can fully transform into ever more powerful forms.</p>
			<p>The shifter class offers players a way to experience a shapeshifting character that is more martially inclined than a spellcasting druid. With each new level, the shifter&#146;s powers grow in new and surprising ways, creating a character that thrives in battle, exploration, and stealth.</p>
			<p>Shifters are protectors of druidic circles and avengers of nature, yet a shifter&#146;s magic is different from that of her druidic kin. Rather than invoking spells from the natural world or forging alliances with animals, shifters focus their supernatural powers inward to gain control over their own forms. Their ability to change their forms is as varied as the wonders of the wilds themselves but always remains at least partially rooted in the natural world. There are many paths to becoming a shifter; most are trained in that role by druidic circles and have their powers unlocked via rituals of initiation. Yet some stumble upon the gift naturally, as if their blood bore the secrets of shifter transformation.</p>
			<p>For those leaning toward the causes of law and good, the path of the shifter is one of contemplation and understanding. They become one with nature through mental and physical mimicry and gain an ever deeper spiritual understanding of the ebb and flow of the natural world. Those leaning toward the chaotic and evil teachings of druidic philosophy find such enlightenment through more violent means. These are typically quicker transformations, both brutal and painful, imparting the dark lessons of nature through its most catastrophic forms. Shifters who lean toward true neutrality are the most diverse when it comes to their command of metamorphic secrets.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The shifter is so attuned to nature and the wild beasts of the world that she can call upon those powers to mystically fortify her being. Fluid in form and function, she can shape herself to overcome hardships and support those she befriends or serves.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any neutral.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p>S <b>tarting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shifter's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p>A shifter speaks Druidic, a secret language known only to druids and shifters, which she learns upon becoming a 1stlevel shifter. Druidic is a free language for a shifter; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages, and it doesn&#146;t take up a language slot. Shifters are forbidden to teach this language to non-druids or non-shifters.</p>
			<p><b>Shifter Aspect (Su): </b>At 1st level, a shifter gains her first aspect&#151;a category of animal to which her body and soul have become supernaturally attuned. She can shift into her aspect&#146;s minor form (see Aspects on page 28) for a number of minutes per day equal to 3 + her shifter level. The duration need not be consecutive but must be spent in 1-minute increments. Shifting into a minor form is a swift action, while ending the effect is a free action that can be taken only on the shifter&#146;s turn. Until a shifter reaches 9th level and gains the chimeric aspect class feature, she can assume only one minor form at a time. Shifting to a new aspect (or aspects, in the case of chimeric aspects or greater chimeric aspects) ends all minor forms currently manifested. The minor forms of aspects are not polymorph effects, and the shifter does not lose the benefits of a minor form while affected by polymorph effects.</p>
			<p>As the shifter gains levels, she gains more aspects; she gains her second aspect at 5th level, a third aspect at 10th level, and a fourth at 15th level. Aspects are detailed in their own section starting on page 28.</p>
			<p><b>Shifter Claws (Su): </b>At will, a shifter in her natural form can extend her claws as a swift action to use as a weapon. This magical transformation is fueled as much by the shifter&#146;s faith in the natural world as it is by inborn talent. The claws on each hand can be used as a primary natural attack, dealing 1d4 points of piercing and slashing damage (1d3 if she is Small). If she uses one of her claw attacks in concert with a weapon held in the other hand, the claw acts as a secondary natural attack instead.</p>
			<p>As the shifter gains levels, the power of her claws increases. At 3rd level, her claws ignore DR/cold iron, DR/magic, and DR/silver. At 7th level, her claw damage increases to 1d6 (1d4 if Small). At 11th level, her claw damage increases to 1d8 (1d6 if Small). At 13th level, her claw damage increases to 1d10 (1d8 if Small). At 17th level, the damage die does not increase, but the critical multiplier becomes &#215;3. Lastly, at 19th level, the claws ignore DR/adamantine and DR/&#151;.</p>
			<p>While a shifter uses wild shape to assume her aspect&#146;s major form, her natural attacks gain the same benefits granted by her shifter claws ability. If the form she takes has claw attacks, she can use either the base damage of her shifter claws or the damage of the form&#146;s claws, whichever is greater. If the form does not have claw attacks, she can choose up to two natural attacks that would deal less damage than her shifter claw damage and have those attacks instead deal the same damage as her shifter claws.</p>
			<p><b>Speak with Plants (Sp): </b>At 1st level, a verdant shifter gains the ability to cast speak with plants as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 plus her Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Verdant Body (Su): </b>At 1st level, a verdant shifter takes on plant qualities as vines grow over her body, flowers bloom in her hair, and bark grows from her skin. The verdant shifter is treated as both her normal creature type and a plant creature for purposes of spells or effects that target a creature by type (such as bane weapons and a ranger&#146;s favored enemy). Verdant body also grants the verdant shifter a 25% immunity to critical hits and precision damage (such as sneak attack).</p>
			<p>At 5th level, the verdant shifter gains a +2 enhancement bonus to her Constitution score. At 8th level, the enhancement bonus to her Constitution score increases to +4 and her immunity to critical hits increases to 50%. At 15th level, the enhancement bonus her Constitution score increases to +6.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a shifter adds half her level as a bonus on Survival checks to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Armor (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a verdant shifter gains a +2 natural armor bonus to her AC while unencumbered and either wearing no armor or wearing light or medium nonmetal armor. This bonus increases by 1 at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, to a maximum of a +7 natural armor bonus to AC at 20th level.</p>
			<p>This replaces defensive instinct.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a shifter can move through any sort of undergrowth (such as briars, natural thorns, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Briars, thorns, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion still affect the shifter.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su): </b>At 4th level, a shifter gains the ability to turn herself into the major form of one of her aspects and back again. This ability functions as beast shape II, except as noted here. The shifter can turn into the major form of only one of her aspects at a time. Using wild shape to change to a major form or back is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke attacks of opportunity. Often a particular aspect&#146;s major form grants abilities beyond the normal effect of beast shape II. Each major form details the abilities the shifter gains with that major form and at what level; she gains these instead of the form abilities from beast shape II, but she still gains beast shape II abilities that are size dependent.</p>
			<p>A shifter loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal of that form can make, but she can communicate with other animals of the same general grouping as her form. She can also communicate in nonverbal ways with allies.</p>
			<p>A shifter can use wild shape for a number of hours each day equal to her shifter level + her Wisdom modifier. It need not be consecutive but must be spent in 1 hour increments. For abilities that function based on &#145;uses of wild shape,&#146; each hour of wild shape counts as a use.</p>
			<p>A shifters can take feats and other abilities that require wild shape; for the purpose of qualifying for prerequisites, her effective druid level is equal to her shifter level.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a shifter leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She can choose to leave a trail if she so desires.</p>
			<p><b>Plant Shape (Su): </b>At 6th level, a verdant shifter&#146;s wild shape ability instead functions as plant shape I. The verdant shifter can maintain this form for a number of rounds per day equal to her shifter level. At 12th level, this ability instead functions as plant shape II, and at 18th level, it functions as plant shape III. This ability otherwise functions as the standard wild shape shifter class feature.</p>
			<p>This alters wild shape and replaces chimeric form and greater chimeric form.</p>
			<p><b>Shifter&#146;s Fury (Ex): </b>At level 6, a shifter gains the ability to make several ferocious attacks with the same natural weapon. Instead of attacking with all her natural weapons, the shifter can choose a single natural weapon and make a full attack with that natural weapon, gaining a second iterative attack at a &#150;5 as if it was a manufactured weapon. When she does so, all her other natural attacks count as secondary attacks and don&#146;t benefit from shifter&#146;s claws. At 11th level, she gains a third iterative attack at a &#150;10 and at 16th level, she gains a fourth iterative attack at &#150;15.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su): </b>At 18th level, a shifter gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the alter self spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 18th level, a shifter no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the shifter still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>
			<h>Speaking Druidic</h>
			<p>For the purposes of teaching and learning the Druidic language, shifters are considered to be druids&#151;the nuances of the language are instrumental in teaching characters of both classes to use and control their abilities. While the rare druidic circle might bar shifters from its order, and while some eccentric shifters may view druids as competitors or even enemies, all shifters are assumed to speak it.</p>
			<h>Ex-Shifters</h>
			<p>A shifter who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a non-druid or a non-shifter loses all her supernatural abilities. She cannot thereafter gain levels as a shifter until she atones (see the atonement spell description on page 245 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<h>Alternate Natural Attacks</h>
			<p>A shifter can draw on her chosen animal aspect to transform her hands into deadly weapons, as represented by the shifter&#146;s claws class feature, but not every animal has prominent claws. The following list provides alternate natural attacks for the shifter claws class feature. Each time the shifter activates her shifter&#146;s claws ability in her natural form, she can manifest one of the alternate natural attacks listed below for any of her chosen aspects, or those that relate to her archetype. Each alternate natural attack replaces one of the shifter&#146;s claw attacks. The shifter can gain up to two different alternate natural attacks with this method. These alternate natural attacks modify only the damage type of the shifter&#146;s natural attacks and otherwise function exactly as the shifter claws class feature.</p>

At 11th level, she gains a third iterative attack at a &#150;10 and at 16th level, she gains a fourth iterative attack at &#150;15.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Swarm shifters channel the essence of the basest and most overlooked animals, vermin.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether riding on the wind as a falcon or hiding in some fetid bog waiting to strike, the shifter is a true master of the wild. Both a devoted defender of druidic circles and a fierce predator, the shifter can take on the forms of nature and even fuse them together with devastating effect and unbridled savagery. By way of the druidic discipline of wild shape, they become living aspects of the wild. At first, they are able to assume only a minor aspect, but with time and practice they can fully transform into ever more powerful forms.</p>
			<p>The shifter class offers players a way to experience a shapeshifting character that is more martially inclined than a spellcasting druid. With each new level, the shifter&#146;s powers grow in new and surprising ways, creating a character that thrives in battle, exploration, and stealth.</p>
			<p>Shifters are protectors of druidic circles and avengers of nature, yet a shifter&#146;s magic is different from that of her druidic kin. Rather than invoking spells from the natural world or forging alliances with animals, shifters focus their supernatural powers inward to gain control over their own forms. Their ability to change their forms is as varied as the wonders of the wilds themselves but always remains at least partially rooted in the natural world. There are many paths to becoming a shifter; most are trained in that role by druidic circles and have their powers unlocked via rituals of initiation. Yet some stumble upon the gift naturally, as if their blood bore the secrets of shifter transformation.</p>
			<p>For those leaning toward the causes of law and good, the path of the shifter is one of contemplation and understanding. They become one with nature through mental and physical mimicry and gain an ever deeper spiritual understanding of the ebb and flow of the natural world. Those leaning toward the chaotic and evil teachings of druidic philosophy find such enlightenment through more violent means. These are typically quicker transformations, both brutal and painful, imparting the dark lessons of nature through its most catastrophic forms. Shifters who lean toward true neutrality are the most diverse when it comes to their command of metamorphic secrets.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The shifter is so attuned to nature and the wild beasts of the world that she can call upon those powers to mystically fortify her being. Fluid in form and function, she can shape herself to overcome hardships and support those she befriends or serves.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any neutral.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p>S <b>tarting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shifter's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A shifter is proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. She is also proficient with the natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) from the shifter claws class feature and of forms she assumes with wild shape.</p>
			<p>Shifters are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor. A shifter can wear wooden armor that has been altered by the ironwood spell so that it functions as if it were steel. Shifters are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A shifter who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to use her shifter aspect, shifter claws, wild shape, and other shifter supernatural or spell-like abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages: </b>A shifter&#146;s bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures, and Aklo, the tongue spoken by certain sinister fey or otherworldly denizens of reaches of the wild rarely explored by humanity. These choices are in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A shifter speaks Druidic, a secret language known only to druids and shifters, which she learns upon becoming a 1stlevel shifter. Druidic is a free language for a shifter; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages, and it doesn&#146;t take up a language slot. Shifters are forbidden to teach this language to non-druids or non-shifters.</p>
			<p><b>Vermin Aspect (Su): </b>As a swift action, a swarm shifter can transform into a swarm of vermin. While in her vermin form, she gains a +2 bonus to natural armor. Her size increases by one size category (as enlarge person, except her reach does not increase to 10 feet), but she can occupy the same space as a creature of any size. She must still attack a target as normal, even if occupying the same space as her target. She can maintain this form for a number of minutes per day equal to 3 + her shifter level. The duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments.</p>
			<p>At 5th level, a swarm shifter becomes immune to bull rush, grapple, and trip combat maneuvers while in vermin form. At 10th level, the swarm shifter&#146;s bonus to natural armor increases to +4 while in vermin form.</p>
			<p>At 15th level, a swarm shifter gains the distraction universal monster ability while in vermin form.</p>
			<p>At 20th level, the swarm shifter becomes immune to critical hits and flanking while in vermin form, but unlike a normal swarm, doesn&#146;t become immune to normal weapon damage.</p>
			<p>This replaces wild shape, shifter aspect, and all improvements to shifter aspect.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A shifter can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 93). The shifter rolls 1d20 and adds her shifter level and Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild empathy, the shifter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another and under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The shifter can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Defensive Instinct (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, when unarmored, not using a shield, unencumbered, and conscious, the shifter adds her Wisdom bonus (if any) to her AC and CMD. If she is wearing nonmetal armor or using a nonmetal shield, she instead adds half her Wisdom bonus to her AC (minimum 0). In addition, the shifter gains a +1 bonus to her AC and CMD at 4th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 shifter levels thereafter (up to a maximum of +5 at 20th level).</p>
			<p>These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks and when the shifter is flatfooted. She loses these bonuses when she is immobilized or helpless. These bonuses do not stack with the monk AC bonus class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a shifter adds half her level as a bonus on Survival checks to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a shifter can move through any sort of undergrowth (such as briars, natural thorns, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Briars, thorns, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion still affect the shifter.</p>
			<p><b>Swarmer (Su): </b>Starting at 4th level, while a swarm shifter is in her natural form, she can transform her hands into living vermin as a swift action at will. This grants her a touch attack that deals 1d6 points of piercing damage and counts as an area attack for the purpose of overcoming the damage reduction of swarms. She doesn&#146;t add her Strength modifier as a bonus on damage rolls for this attack. This damage increases by 1d6 at 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter (maximum 6d6 points of damage at 20th level). A swarm shifter can&#146;t use her normal shifter claws while her hands are transformed in this way.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, a swarm shifter can use this ability to automatically deal her touch attack damage to foes that she is grappling.</p>
			<p>At 15th level, a swarm shifter can use this ability while in her vermin form to automatically deal her touch attack damage to foes within her squares.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a shifter leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She can choose to leave a trail if she so desires.</p>
			<p><b>Shifter&#146;s Fury (Ex): </b>At level 6, a shifter gains the ability to make several ferocious attacks with the same natural weapon. Instead of attacking with all her natural weapons, the shifter can choose a single natural weapon and make a full attack with that natural weapon, gaining a second iterative attack at a &#150;5 as if it was a manufactured weapon. When she does so, all her other natural attacks count as secondary attacks and don&#146;t benefit from shifter&#146;s claws. At 11th level, she gains a third iterative attack at a &#150;10 and at 16th level, she gains a fourth iterative attack at &#150;15.</p>
			<p><b>Swarm Flow (Su): </b>At 9th level, when a swarm shifter uses her vermin aspect ability, she gains a swarm ability from the list below. She can select a different ability each time she uses her vermin aspect ability.</p>
			<p><i>Crawling: </i>The swarm shifter gains a climb speed equal to her base speed.</p>
			<p><i>Flying: </i>The swarm shifter gains a fly speed equal to her base speed, with good maneuverability.</p>
			<p><i>Undulating: </i>The swarm shifter gains a burrow speed equal to her base speed.</p>
			<p>This replaces chimeric aspect.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Swarm Flow (Su): </b>At 14th level, when using her vermin aspect ability, a swarm shifter also gains a greater swarm ability from the list below. She can select a different ability each time she uses her vermin aspect ability.</p>
			<p><i>Crawling: </i>The swarm shifter gains tremorsense with a range of 60 feet and a +4 bonus on Perception checks.</p>
			<p><i>Flying: </i>The swarm shifter&#146;s claws change to venomous stingers that deliver poison on each attack. (Poison: injury; save Fort DC = 10 + half the swarm shifter&#146;s level + her Constitution modifier; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Dexterity damage; cure 2 consecutive saves).</p>
			<p><i>Undulating: </i>Whenever the swarm shifter is subject to a critical hit, she gains fast healing equal to 1/3 her level for a number of rounds equal to 3 + her Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p>This replaces greater chimeric aspect.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su): </b>At 18th level, a shifter gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the alter self spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 18th level, a shifter no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the shifter still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>
			<p><b>Final Aspect (Su): </b>At 20th level, a swarm shifter becomes an embodiment of swarms and can cast swarm skin as a spell-like ability at will with a caster level equal to her character level. She can separate into up to five swarms, regardless of the number of levels required per swarm. When transforming into swarms with this ability, the swarm shifter still selects swarm abilities granted by the swarm flow and greater swarm flow abilities to apply to her swarm forms. The chosen swarm abilities apply to all swarms.</p>
			<p>This modifies final aspect.</p>
			<h>Speaking Druidic</h>
			<p>For the purposes of teaching and learning the Druidic language, shifters are considered to be druids&#151;the nuances of the language are instrumental in teaching characters of both classes to use and control their abilities. While the rare druidic circle might bar shifters from its order, and while some eccentric shifters may view druids as competitors or even enemies, all shifters are assumed to speak it.</p>
			<h>Ex-Shifters</h>
			<p>A shifter who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a non-druid or a non-shifter loses all her supernatural abilities. She cannot thereafter gain levels as a shifter until she atones (see the atonement spell description on page 245 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<h>Alternate Natural Attacks</h>
			<p>A shifter can draw on her chosen animal aspect to transform her hands into deadly weapons, as represented by the shifter&#146;s claws class feature, but not every animal has prominent claws. The following list provides alternate natural attacks for the shifter claws class feature. Each time the shifter activates her shifter&#146;s claws ability in her natural form, she can manifest one of the alternate natural attacks listed below for any of her chosen aspects, or those that relate to her archetype. Each alternate natural attack replaces one of the shifter&#146;s claw attacks. The shifter can gain up to two different alternate natural attacks with this method. These alternate natural attacks modify only the damage type of the shifter&#146;s natural attacks and otherwise function exactly as the shifter claws class feature.</p>

A style shifter can shift into a style aspect as a free action as part of entering a style feat&#146;s stance.

					<p>At will, a shifter in her natural form can extend her claws as a swift action to use as a weapon. This magical transformation is fueled as much by the shifter&#146;s faith in the natural world as it is by inborn talent. The claws on each hand can be used as a primary natural attack, dealing 1d4 points of piercing and slashing damage (1d3 if she is Small). If she uses one of her claw attacks in concert with a weapon held in the other hand, the claw acts as a secondary natural attack instead.</p>
					<p>As the shifter gains levels, the power of her claws increases. At 3rd level, her claws ignore DR/cold iron, DR/magic, and DR/silver. At 7th level, her claw damage increases to 1d6 (1d4 if Small). At 11th level, her claw damage increases to 1d8 (1d6 if Small). At 13th level, her claw damage increases to 1d10 (1d8 if Small). At 17th level, the damage die does not increase, but the critical multiplier becomes &#215;3. Lastly, at 19th level, the claws ignore DR/adamantine and DR/&#151;.</p>
					<p>While a shifter uses wild shape to assume her aspect&#146;s major form, her natural attacks gain the same benefits granted by her shifter claws ability. If the form she takes has claw attacks, she can use either the base damage of her shifter claws or the damage of the form&#146;s claws, whichever is greater. If the form does not have claw attacks, she can choose up to two natural attacks that would deal less damage than her shifter claw damage and have those attacks instead deal the same damage as her shifter claws.</p>

The shifter rolls 1d20 and adds her shifter level and Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild empathy, the shifter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another and under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
					<p>The shifter can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Among the many warriors that train on Tian Xia&#146;s Wall of Heaven, a select few have been able to perfect their combat techniques to the point where they can augment a combat style by partially transforming into the creature that inspired it. These style shifters have honed their techniques and shared them with the rest of Golarion.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether riding on the wind as a falcon or hiding in some fetid bog waiting to strike, the shifter is a true master of the wild. Both a devoted defender of druidic circles and a fierce predator, the shifter can take on the forms of nature and even fuse them together with devastating effect and unbridled savagery. By way of the druidic discipline of wild shape, they become living aspects of the wild. At first, they are able to assume only a minor aspect, but with time and practice they can fully transform into ever more powerful forms.</p>
			<p>The shifter class offers players a way to experience a shapeshifting character that is more martially inclined than a spellcasting druid. With each new level, the shifter&#146;s powers grow in new and surprising ways, creating a character that thrives in battle, exploration, and stealth.</p>
			<p>Shifters are protectors of druidic circles and avengers of nature, yet a shifter&#146;s magic is different from that of her druidic kin. Rather than invoking spells from the natural world or forging alliances with animals, shifters focus their supernatural powers inward to gain control over their own forms. Their ability to change their forms is as varied as the wonders of the wilds themselves but always remains at least partially rooted in the natural world. There are many paths to becoming a shifter; most are trained in that role by druidic circles and have their powers unlocked via rituals of initiation. Yet some stumble upon the gift naturally, as if their blood bore the secrets of shifter transformation.</p>
			<p>For those leaning toward the causes of law and good, the path of the shifter is one of contemplation and understanding. They become one with nature through mental and physical mimicry and gain an ever deeper spiritual understanding of the ebb and flow of the natural world. Those leaning toward the chaotic and evil teachings of druidic philosophy find such enlightenment through more violent means. These are typically quicker transformations, both brutal and painful, imparting the dark lessons of nature through its most catastrophic forms. Shifters who lean toward true neutrality are the most diverse when it comes to their command of metamorphic secrets.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The shifter is so attuned to nature and the wild beasts of the world that she can call upon those powers to mystically fortify her being. Fluid in form and function, she can shape herself to overcome hardships and support those she befriends or serves.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any neutral.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p>S <b>tarting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shifter's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A shifter is proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. She is also proficient with the natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) from the shifter claws class feature and of forms she assumes with wild shape.</p>
			<p>Shifters are proficient with light armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor. A shifter can wear wooden armor that has been altered by the ironwood spell so that it functions as if it were steel.</p>
			<p>A shifter who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to use her shifter aspect, shifter claws, wild shape, and other shifter supernatural or spell-like abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages: </b>A shifter&#146;s bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures, and Aklo, the tongue spoken by certain sinister fey or otherworldly denizens of reaches of the wild rarely explored by humanity. These choices are in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A shifter speaks Druidic, a secret language known only to druids and shifters, which she learns upon becoming a 1stlevel shifter. Druidic is a free language for a shifter; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages, and it doesn&#146;t take up a language slot. Shifters are forbidden to teach this language to non-druids or non-shifters.</p>
			<p><b>Natural Strikes (Ex): </b>A style shifter is considered to have Improved Unarmed Strike for the purposes of feat prerequisites and can apply the effects of feats that have Improved Unarmed Strike as a prerequisite to her shifter claws.</p>
			<p><b>Style Mastery (Ex): </b>At 1st level, 5th level, and every 5 levels thereafter, a style shifter gains a bonus style feat. He does not need to meet the prerequisites of the feat. Starting at 5th level, he can choose to instead gain a wildcard style slot. Whenever he enters one or more styles, he can spend his wildcard style slots to gain feats in those styles&#146; feat paths (such as Panther Claw if he enters Panther Style) as long as he meets their prerequisites. Each time he changes styles, he can also change these wildcard style slots.</p>
			<p><b>Style Shifting (Ex): </b>A style shifter gains access to style aspects. A style aspect provides benefits only while the style shifter is in the style feat stance associated with the appropriate aspect (such as Boar Style with Form of the Boar). He can shift into his style aspect for a number of minutes per day equal to 3 + his shifter level. The duration need not be consecutive but must be spent in 1-minute increments. A style shifter can shift into a style aspect as a free action as part of entering a style feat&#146;s stance. Otherwise, shifting into a style aspect is a swift action, while ending the effect is a free action that can be taken only on the style shifter&#146;s turn. He can shift between any aspects he has during the duration without additional cost.</p>
			<p>This replaces shifter aspect, chimeric aspect, greater chimeric aspect, and final aspect.</p>
			<p><b>Shifter Aspect (Su): </b>At 1st level, a shifter gains her first aspect&#151;a category of animal to which her body and soul have become supernaturally attuned. She can shift into her aspect&#146;s minor form (see Aspects on page 28) for a number of minutes per day equal to 3 + her shifter level. The duration need not be consecutive but must be spent in 1-minute increments. Shifting into a minor form is a swift action, while ending the effect is a free action that can be taken only on the shifter&#146;s turn. Until a shifter reaches 9th level and gains the chimeric aspect class feature, she can assume only one minor form at a time. Shifting to a new aspect (or aspects, in the case of chimeric aspects or greater chimeric aspects) ends all minor forms currently manifested. The minor forms of aspects are not polymorph effects, and the shifter does not lose the benefits of a minor form while affected by polymorph effects.</p>
			<p>As the shifter gains levels, she gains more aspects; she gains her second aspect at 5th level, a third aspect at 10th level, and a fourth at 15th level. Aspects are detailed in their own section starting on page 28.</p>
			<p><b>Shifter Claws (Su): </b>At will, a shifter in her natural form can extend her claws as a swift action to use as a weapon. This magical transformation is fueled as much by the shifter&#146;s faith in the natural world as it is by inborn talent. The claws on each hand can be used as a primary natural attack, dealing 1d4 points of piercing and slashing damage (1d3 if she is Small). If she uses one of her claw attacks in concert with a weapon held in the other hand, the claw acts as a secondary natural attack instead.</p>
			<p>As the shifter gains levels, the power of her claws increases. At 3rd level, her claws ignore DR/cold iron, DR/magic, and DR/silver. At 7th level, her claw damage increases to 1d6 (1d4 if Small). At 11th level, her claw damage increases to 1d8 (1d6 if Small). At 13th level, her claw damage increases to 1d10 (1d8 if Small). At 17th level, the damage die does not increase, but the critical multiplier becomes &#215;3. Lastly, at 19th level, the claws ignore DR/adamantine and DR/&#151;.</p>
			<p>While a shifter uses wild shape to assume her aspect&#146;s major form, her natural attacks gain the same benefits granted by her shifter claws ability. If the form she takes has claw attacks, she can use either the base damage of her shifter claws or the damage of the form&#146;s claws, whichever is greater. If the form does not have claw attacks, she can choose up to two natural attacks that would deal less damage than her shifter claw damage and have those attacks instead deal the same damage as her shifter claws.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A shifter can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 93). The shifter rolls 1d20 and adds her shifter level and Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild empathy, the shifter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another and under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The shifter can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Defensive Instinct (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, when unarmored, not using a shield, unencumbered, and conscious, the shifter adds her Wisdom bonus (if any) to her AC and CMD. If she is wearing nonmetal armor or using a nonmetal shield, she instead adds half her Wisdom bonus to her AC (minimum 0). In addition, the shifter gains a +1 bonus to her AC and CMD at 4th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 shifter levels thereafter (up to a maximum of +5 at 20th level).</p>
			<p>These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks and when the shifter is flatfooted. She loses these bonuses when she is immobilized or helpless. These bonuses do not stack with the monk AC bonus class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a shifter adds half her level as a bonus on Survival checks to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a shifter can move through any sort of undergrowth (such as briars, natural thorns, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Briars, thorns, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion still affect the shifter.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su): </b>At 4th level, a shifter gains the ability to turn herself into the major form of one of her aspects and back again. This ability functions as beast shape II, except as noted here. The shifter can turn into the major form of only one of her aspects at a time. Using wild shape to change to a major form or back is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke attacks of opportunity. Often a particular aspect&#146;s major form grants abilities beyond the normal effect of beast shape II. Each major form details the abilities the shifter gains with that major form and at what level; she gains these instead of the form abilities from beast shape II, but she still gains beast shape II abilities that are size dependent.</p>
			<p>A shifter loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal of that form can make, but she can communicate with other animals of the same general grouping as her form. She can also communicate in nonverbal ways with allies.</p>
			<p>A shifter can use wild shape for a number of hours each day equal to her shifter level + her Wisdom modifier. It need not be consecutive but must be spent in 1 hour increments. For abilities that function based on &#145;uses of wild shape,&#146; each hour of wild shape counts as a use.</p>
			<p>A shifters can take feats and other abilities that require wild shape; for the purpose of qualifying for prerequisites, her effective druid level is equal to her shifter level.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a shifter leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She can choose to leave a trail if she so desires.</p>
			<p><b>Form of the Wild (Su): </b>At 6th level, a style shifter gains the ability to turn into other creatures. This functions as a druid&#146;s wild shape ability, except he does not gain the ability to turn into an elemental. The shifter&#146;s effective druid level is equal to his class level. He can use this ability for a number of hours per day equal to 1/3 his effective druid level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-hour increments. For abilities that function based on uses of wild shape, each hour of form of the wild counts as a use.</p>
			<p>This alters wild shape.</p>
			<p><b>Shifter&#146;s Fury (Ex): </b>At level 6, a shifter gains the ability to make several ferocious attacks with the same natural weapon. Instead of attacking with all her natural weapons, the shifter can choose a single natural weapon and make a full attack with that natural weapon, gaining a second iterative attack at a &#150;5 as if it was a manufactured weapon. When she does so, all her other natural attacks count as secondary attacks and don&#146;t benefit from shifter&#146;s claws. At 11th level, she gains a third iterative attack at a &#150;10 and at 16th level, she gains a fourth iterative attack at &#150;15.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su): </b>At 18th level, a shifter gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the alter self spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 18th level, a shifter no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the shifter still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>
			<h>Speaking Druidic</h>
			<p>For the purposes of teaching and learning the Druidic language, shifters are considered to be druids&#151;the nuances of the language are instrumental in teaching characters of both classes to use and control their abilities. While the rare druidic circle might bar shifters from its order, and while some eccentric shifters may view druids as competitors or even enemies, all shifters are assumed to speak it.</p>
			<h>Ex-Shifters</h>
			<p>A shifter who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a non-druid or a non-shifter loses all her supernatural abilities. She cannot thereafter gain levels as a shifter until she atones (see the atonement spell description on page 245 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<h>Alternate Natural Attacks</h>
			<p>A shifter can draw on her chosen animal aspect to transform her hands into deadly weapons, as represented by the shifter&#146;s claws class feature, but not every animal has prominent claws. The following list provides alternate natural attacks for the shifter claws class feature. Each time the shifter activates her shifter&#146;s claws ability in her natural form, she can manifest one of the alternate natural attacks listed below for any of her chosen aspects, or those that relate to her archetype. Each alternate natural attack replaces one of the shifter&#146;s claw attacks. The shifter can gain up to two different alternate natural attacks with this method. These alternate natural attacks modify only the damage type of the shifter&#146;s natural attacks and otherwise function exactly as the shifter claws class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Bat: </b>Bite (B, P, S), wing (B).</p>
			<p><b>Bear: </b>Bite (B, P, S).</p>

					<p>At will, a shifter in her natural form can extend her claws as a swift action to use as a weapon. This magical transformation is fueled as much by the shifter&#146;s faith in the natural world as it is by inborn talent. The claws on each hand can be used as a primary natural attack, dealing 1d4 points of piercing and slashing damage (1d3 if she is Small). If she uses one of her claw attacks in concert with a weapon held in the other hand, the claw acts as a secondary natural attack instead.</p>
					<p>As the shifter gains levels, the power of her claws increases. At 3rd level, her claws ignore DR/cold iron, DR/magic, and DR/silver. At 7th level, her claw damage increases to 1d6 (1d4 if Small). At 11th level, her claw damage increases to 1d8 (1d6 if Small). At 13th level, her claw damage increases to 1d10 (1d8 if Small).

The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild empathy, the shifter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another and under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Not all shifters represent the balance of nature. The rageshaper is a destructive force of nature brought to bear&#151;a wild and uncontrollable engine of annihilation fueled by wrath. Rageshapers fly into bloodletting frenzies and rain down devastation like unstoppable natural disasters.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether riding on the wind as a falcon or hiding in some fetid bog waiting to strike, the shifter is a true master of the wild. Both a devoted defender of druidic circles and a fierce predator, the shifter can take on the forms of nature and even fuse them together with devastating effect and unbridled savagery. By way of the druidic discipline of wild shape, they become living aspects of the wild. At first, they are able to assume only a minor aspect, but with time and practice they can fully transform into ever more powerful forms.</p>
			<p>The shifter class offers players a way to experience a shapeshifting character that is more martially inclined than a spellcasting druid. With each new level, the shifter&#146;s powers grow in new and surprising ways, creating a character that thrives in battle, exploration, and stealth.</p>
			<p>Shifters are protectors of druidic circles and avengers of nature, yet a shifter&#146;s magic is different from that of her druidic kin. Rather than invoking spells from the natural world or forging alliances with animals, shifters focus their supernatural powers inward to gain control over their own forms. Their ability to change their forms is as varied as the wonders of the wilds themselves but always remains at least partially rooted in the natural world. There are many paths to becoming a shifter; most are trained in that role by druidic circles and have their powers unlocked via rituals of initiation. Yet some stumble upon the gift naturally, as if their blood bore the secrets of shifter transformation.</p>
			<p>For those leaning toward the causes of law and good, the path of the shifter is one of contemplation and understanding. They become one with nature through mental and physical mimicry and gain an ever deeper spiritual understanding of the ebb and flow of the natural world. Those leaning toward the chaotic and evil teachings of druidic philosophy find such enlightenment through more violent means. These are typically quicker transformations, both brutal and painful, imparting the dark lessons of nature through its most catastrophic forms. Shifters who lean toward true neutrality are the most diverse when it comes to their command of metamorphic secrets.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The shifter is so attuned to nature and the wild beasts of the world that she can call upon those powers to mystically fortify her being. Fluid in form and function, she can shape herself to overcome hardships and support those she befriends or serves.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>A rageshaper can be any nonlawful alignment. A rageshaper who becomes lawful cannot take any further levels in rageshaper, but he does not lose access to any rageshaper abilities he has already gained.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p>S <b>tarting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shifter's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

Additionally, rather than granting the ability to bypass different kinds of damage reduction, the rageshaper&#146;s terrible slam ignores some of an object&#146;s hardness. At 1st level, terrible slam ignores 5 points of an object&#146;s hardness. This increases to 10 points at 5th level, 15 points at 10th level, and 20 points at 15th level.</p>
			<p>This alters shifter claws.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A shifter can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 93). The shifter rolls 1d20 and adds her shifter level and Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild empathy, the shifter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another and under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The shifter can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Invulnerable Defenses (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a rageshaper becomes difficult to harm in his devastating form. Whenever the rageshaper takes on his devastating form and is unencumbered and either wearing no armor or wearing light or medium nonmetal armor, he gains a +2 natural armor bonus to his AC and DR 2/&#151;.</p>
			<p>This replaces defensive instinct, chimeric aspect, and greater chimeric aspect.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a shifter adds half her level as a bonus on Survival checks to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Unrestrained Stride (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, whenever the rageshaper is in devastating form, he ignores movement penalties from difficult terrain and is immune to the entangled condition.</p>
			<p>This replaces woodland stride.</p>
			<p><b>Terrible Leap (Ex): </b>At 5th level, when a rageshaper is in his devastating form, he can perform a terrible leap as a move action without attempting an Acrobatics check, jumping any distance up to his move speed (upward movement counts as double, as when flying). He can leap in this way once per day per shifter level.</p>
			<p>This replaces trackless step.</p>
			<p><b>Shifter&#146;s Fury (Ex): </b>At level 6, a shifter gains the ability to make several ferocious attacks with the same natural weapon. Instead of attacking with all her natural weapons, the shifter can choose a single natural weapon and make a full attack with that natural weapon, gaining a second iterative attack at a &#150;5 as if it was a manufactured weapon. When she does so, all her other natural attacks count as secondary attacks and don&#146;t benefit from shifter&#146;s claws. At 11th level, she gains a third iterative attack at a &#150;10 and at 16th level, she gains a fourth iterative attack at &#150;15.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su): </b>At 18th level, a shifter gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the alter self spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 18th level, a shifter no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the shifter still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>
			<h>Speaking Druidic</h>
			<p>For the purposes of teaching and learning the Druidic language, shifters are considered to be druids&#151;the nuances of the language are instrumental in teaching characters of both classes to use and control their abilities. While the rare druidic circle might bar shifters from its order, and while some eccentric shifters may view druids as competitors or even enemies, all shifters are assumed to speak it.</p>
			<h>Ex-Shifters</h>
			<p>A shifter who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a non-druid or a non-shifter loses all her supernatural abilities. She cannot thereafter gain levels as a shifter until she atones (see the atonement spell description on page 245 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<h>Alternate Natural Attacks</h>
			<p>A shifter can draw on her chosen animal aspect to transform her hands into deadly weapons, as represented by the shifter&#146;s claws class feature, but not every animal has prominent claws. The following list provides alternate natural attacks for the shifter claws class feature. Each time the shifter activates her shifter&#146;s claws ability in her natural form, she can manifest one of the alternate natural attacks listed below for any of her chosen aspects, or those that relate to her archetype. Each alternate natural attack replaces one of the shifter&#146;s claw attacks. The shifter can gain up to two different alternate natural attacks with this method. These alternate natural attacks modify only the damage type of the shifter&#146;s natural attacks and otherwise function exactly as the shifter claws class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Bat: </b>Bite (B, P, S), wing (B).</p>
			<p><b>Bear: </b>Bite (B, P, S).</p>
			<p><b>Bull: </b>Gore (P), hoof (B), slam (B).</p>

					<p>At 1st level, a shifter gains her first aspect&#151;a category of animal to which her body and soul have become supernaturally attuned. She can shift into her aspect&#146;s minor form (see Aspects on page 28) for a number of minutes per day equal to 3 + her shifter level. The duration need not be consecutive but must be spent in 1-minute increments. Shifting into a minor form is a swift action, while ending the effect is a free action that can be taken only on the shifter&#146;s turn. Until a shifter reaches 9th level and gains the chimeric aspect class feature, she can assume only one minor form at a time. Shifting to a new aspect (or aspects, in the case of chimeric aspects or greater chimeric aspects) ends all minor forms currently manifested. The minor forms of aspects are not polymorph effects, and the shifter does not lose the benefits of a minor form while affected by polymorph effects.</p>
					<p>As the shifter gains levels, she gains more aspects; she gains her second aspect at 5th level, a third aspect at 10th level, and a fourth at 15th level. Aspects are detailed in their own section starting on page 28.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>While most shifters are trained in druidic traditions that allow them to tap into animalistic powers, others look instead to the simplest forms of life for inspiration. Known as oozemorphs, these shifters focus on the ooze&#151;a form of life as simple in construction as it is dangerous in combat. While some shifters consider the oozemorph to be unsettling or even vile, these shifters merely embrace a stranger form of life than most. They are not inherently evil, yet they are often misunderstood by druidic circles and these circles&#146; shifter champions.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether riding on the wind as a falcon or hiding in some fetid bog waiting to strike, the shifter is a true master of the wild. Both a devoted defender of druidic circles and a fierce predator, the shifter can take on the forms of nature and even fuse them together with devastating effect and unbridled savagery. By way of the druidic discipline of wild shape, they become living aspects of the wild. At first, they are able to assume only a minor aspect, but with time and practice they can fully transform into ever more powerful forms.</p>
			<p>The shifter class offers players a way to experience a shapeshifting character that is more martially inclined than a spellcasting druid. With each new level, the shifter&#146;s powers grow in new and surprising ways, creating a character that thrives in battle, exploration, and stealth.</p>
			<p>Shifters are protectors of druidic circles and avengers of nature, yet a shifter&#146;s magic is different from that of her druidic kin. Rather than invoking spells from the natural world or forging alliances with animals, shifters focus their supernatural powers inward to gain control over their own forms. Their ability to change their forms is as varied as the wonders of the wilds themselves but always remains at least partially rooted in the natural world. There are many paths to becoming a shifter; most are trained in that role by druidic circles and have their powers unlocked via rituals of initiation. Yet some stumble upon the gift naturally, as if their blood bore the secrets of shifter transformation.</p>
			<p>For those leaning toward the causes of law and good, the path of the shifter is one of contemplation and understanding. They become one with nature through mental and physical mimicry and gain an ever deeper spiritual understanding of the ebb and flow of the natural world. Those leaning toward the chaotic and evil teachings of druidic philosophy find such enlightenment through more violent means. These are typically quicker transformations, both brutal and painful, imparting the dark lessons of nature through its most catastrophic forms. Shifters who lean toward true neutrality are the most diverse when it comes to their command of metamorphic secrets.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The shifter is so attuned to nature and the wild beasts of the world that she can call upon those powers to mystically fortify her being. Fluid in form and function, she can shape herself to overcome hardships and support those she befriends or serves.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any neutral.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p>S <b>tarting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shifter's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>

Each hour after this duration, the oozemorph must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or revert back to her fluidic body until she rests for at least 8 hours. This save DC increases by 1 for each additional hour spent maintaining the form.</p>
			<p>At 8th level, the oozemorph can treat this ability as beast shape I, and at 15th level, she can treat this ability as beast shape II or giant shape I.</p>
			<p>Ending this transformation at any time reverts the oozemorph back to her ooze form and renders her fatigued for a number of minutes equal to the number of hours she maintained the form.</p>
			<p>This replaces chimeric form, greater chimeric form, wild shape, shifter aspect, and all improvements of shifter aspect.</p>
			<p><b>Morphic Weaponry (Ex): </b>An oozemorph can create a number of natural weapons to fight with from any portion of her body, regardless of her current form. At 1st level, as a move action, an oozemorph can form two primary natural attacks that each deal 1d6 points of bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, chosen by the oozemorph when she forms them. An oozemorph can change the damage type of any number of her natural weapons as a swift action. An oozemorph gains one additional primary natural attack at 6th level and another at 15th level.</p>
			<p>The total number of natural attacks an oozemorph has at any given time includes those gained via her current form. For example, an 8th-level oozemorph who has taken the form of a wolf with beast shape I has a bite attack as part of that form; she can create only two additional natural attacks via morphic weaponry, for a total of three attacks available to her at that level. If the oozemorph later reverts to a humanoid form with no natural weapons, she can instead create three morphic weapons.</p>
			<p>This replaces shifter claws.</p>
			<p><b>Ooze Empathy (Ex): </b>An oozemorph gains the shifter&#146;s wild empathy class feature, but she can use it only to influence the attitude of oozes with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower. An oozemorph can use this ability on mindless oozes; when she does so, she imparts a modicum of intellect to the ooze to allow it to respond to her commands.</p>
			<p>This alters wild empathy.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A shifter can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 93). The shifter rolls 1d20 and adds her shifter level and Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild empathy, the shifter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another and under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The shifter can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, an oozemorph gains DR 4/slashing while unencumbered and either wearing no armor or wearing light nonmetal armor. This damage reduction increases by 2 at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, to a maximum of DR 14/slashing at 20th level.</p>
			<p>This replaces defensive instinct.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a shifter adds half her level as a bonus on Survival checks to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Clinging Ooze (Ex): </b>At 4th level, when in her natural form, an oozemorph gains a climb speed of 10 feet.</p>
			<p>This replaces woodland stride.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a shifter leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She can choose to leave a trail if she so desires.</p>
			<p><b>Shifter&#146;s Fury (Ex): </b>At level 6, a shifter gains the ability to make several ferocious attacks with the same natural weapon. Instead of attacking with all her natural weapons, the shifter can choose a single natural weapon and make a full attack with that natural weapon, gaining a second iterative attack at a &#150;5 as if it was a manufactured weapon. When she does so, all her other natural attacks count as secondary attacks and don&#146;t benefit from shifter&#146;s claws. At 11th level, she gains a third iterative attack at a &#150;10 and at 16th level, she gains a fourth iterative attack at &#150;15.</p>
			<p><b>Chimeric Aspect (Su): </b>At 9th level, when a shifter uses her shifter aspect ability to take on a minor form, she can choose two aspects and assume the minor form of each aspect.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Chimeric Aspect (Su): </b>At 14th level, when a shifter uses her shifter aspect ability to take on a minor form, she can choose up to three aspects and assume the minor form of each aspect.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su): </b>At 18th level, a shifter gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the alter self spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 18th level, a shifter no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the shifter still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>
			<h>Speaking Druidic</h>
			<p>For the purposes of teaching and learning the Druidic language, shifters are considered to be druids&#151;the nuances of the language are instrumental in teaching characters of both classes to use and control their abilities. While the rare druidic circle might bar shifters from its order, and while some eccentric shifters may view druids as competitors or even enemies, all shifters are assumed to speak it.</p>
			<h>Ex-Shifters</h>
			<p>A shifter who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a non-druid or a non-shifter loses all her supernatural abilities. She cannot thereafter gain levels as a shifter until she atones (see the atonement spell description on page 245 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<h>Alternate Natural Attacks</h>
			<p>A shifter can draw on her chosen animal aspect to transform her hands into deadly weapons, as represented by the shifter&#146;s claws class feature, but not every animal has prominent claws. The following list provides alternate natural attacks for the shifter claws class feature. Each time the shifter activates her shifter&#146;s claws ability in her natural form, she can manifest one of the alternate natural attacks listed below for any of her chosen aspects, or those that relate to her archetype. Each alternate natural attack replaces one of the shifter&#146;s claw attacks. The shifter can gain up to two different alternate natural attacks with this method. These alternate natural attacks modify only the damage type of the shifter&#146;s natural attacks and otherwise function exactly as the shifter claws class feature.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At will, a shifter in her natural form can extend her claws as a swift action to use as a weapon. This magical transformation is fueled as much by the shifter&#146;s faith in the natural world as it is by inborn talent. The claws on each hand can be used as a primary natural attack, dealing 1d4 points of piercing and slashing damage (1d3 if she is Small). If she uses one of her claw attacks in concert with a weapon held in the other hand, the claw acts as a secondary natural attack instead.</p>
					<p>As the shifter gains levels, the power of her claws increases. At 3rd level, her claws ignore DR/cold iron, DR/magic, and DR/silver. At 7th level, her claw damage increases to 1d6 (1d4 if Small). At 11th level, her claw damage increases to 1d8 (1d6 if Small). At 13th level, her claw damage increases to 1d10 (1d8 if Small). At 17th level, the damage die does not increase, but the critical multiplier becomes &#215;3. Lastly, at 19th level, the claws ignore DR/adamantine and DR/&#151;.</p>
					<p>While a shifter uses wild shape to assume her aspect&#146;s major form, her natural attacks gain the same benefits granted by her shifter claws ability. If the form she takes has claw attacks, she can use either the base damage of her shifter claws or the damage of the form&#146;s claws, whichever is greater. If the form does not have claw attacks, she can choose up to two natural attacks that would deal less damage than her shifter claw damage and have those attacks instead deal the same damage as her shifter claws.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Rather than assume aspects taken from the traits of natural animals, a leafshifter transforms into plant-animal hybrids that resemble living topiaries. This affords the leafshifter the savage power of the animal kingdom while also granting her the strength and timelessness of plant life. (The shifter class can be found on page 26.)</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether riding on the wind as a falcon or hiding in some fetid bog waiting to strike, the shifter is a true master of the wild. Both a devoted defender of druidic circles and a fierce predator, the shifter can take on the forms of nature and even fuse them together with devastating effect and unbridled savagery. By way of the druidic discipline of wild shape, they become living aspects of the wild. At first, they are able to assume only a minor aspect, but with time and practice they can fully transform into ever more powerful forms.</p>
			<p>The shifter class offers players a way to experience a shapeshifting character that is more martially inclined than a spellcasting druid. With each new level, the shifter&#146;s powers grow in new and surprising ways, creating a character that thrives in battle, exploration, and stealth.</p>
			<p>Shifters are protectors of druidic circles and avengers of nature, yet a shifter&#146;s magic is different from that of her druidic kin. Rather than invoking spells from the natural world or forging alliances with animals, shifters focus their supernatural powers inward to gain control over their own forms. Their ability to change their forms is as varied as the wonders of the wilds themselves but always remains at least partially rooted in the natural world. There are many paths to becoming a shifter; most are trained in that role by druidic circles and have their powers unlocked via rituals of initiation. Yet some stumble upon the gift naturally, as if their blood bore the secrets of shifter transformation.</p>
			<p>For those leaning toward the causes of law and good, the path of the shifter is one of contemplation and understanding. They become one with nature through mental and physical mimicry and gain an ever deeper spiritual understanding of the ebb and flow of the natural world. Those leaning toward the chaotic and evil teachings of druidic philosophy find such enlightenment through more violent means. These are typically quicker transformations, both brutal and painful, imparting the dark lessons of nature through its most catastrophic forms. Shifters who lean toward true neutrality are the most diverse when it comes to their command of metamorphic secrets.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The shifter is so attuned to nature and the wild beasts of the world that she can call upon those powers to mystically fortify her being. Fluid in form and function, she can shape herself to overcome hardships and support those she befriends or serves.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any neutral.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p><b>Race: </b>Ghoran only</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shifter's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A shifter is proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. She is also proficient with the natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) from the shifter claws class feature and of forms she assumes with wild shape.</p>
			<p>Shifters are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor. A shifter can wear wooden armor that has been altered by the ironwood spell so that it functions as if it were steel. Shifters are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A shifter who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to use her shifter aspect, shifter claws, wild shape, and other shifter supernatural or spell-like abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages: </b>A shifter&#146;s bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures, and Aklo, the tongue spoken by certain sinister fey or otherworldly denizens of reaches of the wild rarely explored by humanity. These choices are in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A shifter speaks Druidic, a secret language known only to druids and shifters, which she learns upon becoming a 1stlevel shifter. Druidic is a free language for a shifter; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages, and it doesn&#146;t take up a language slot. Shifters are forbidden to teach this language to non-druids or non-shifters.</p>
			<p><b>Leafshifter&#146;s Aspect (Su): </b>This ability functions as the shifter aspect ability of the standard shifter, except a leafshifter doesn&#146;t gain the minor forms of her aspects. Instead, whenever she gains a new aspect, she chooses one of the plant focus abilities from the plant master hunter archetype (see page 53) to associate with her new aspect. This choice cannot be changed once made.</p>
			<p>This alters shifter aspect.</p>
			<p><b>Shifter Aspect (Su): </b>At 1st level, a shifter gains her first aspect&#151;a category of animal to which her body and soul have become supernaturally attuned. She can shift into her aspect&#146;s minor form (see Aspects on page 28) for a number of minutes per day equal to 3 + her shifter level. The duration need not be consecutive but must be spent in 1-minute increments. Shifting into a minor form is a swift action, while ending the effect is a free action that can be taken only on the shifter&#146;s turn. Until a shifter reaches 9th level and gains the chimeric aspect class feature, she can assume only one minor form at a time. Shifting to a new aspect (or aspects, in the case of chimeric aspects or greater chimeric aspects) ends all minor forms currently manifested. The minor forms of aspects are not polymorph effects, and the shifter does not lose the benefits of a minor form while affected by polymorph effects.</p>
			<p>As the shifter gains levels, she gains more aspects; she gains her second aspect at 5th level, a third aspect at 10th level, and a fourth at 15th level. Aspects are detailed in their own section starting on page 28.</p>
			<p><b>Shifter Claws (Su): </b>At will, a shifter in her natural form can extend her claws as a swift action to use as a weapon. This magical transformation is fueled as much by the shifter&#146;s faith in the natural world as it is by inborn talent. The claws on each hand can be used as a primary natural attack, dealing 1d4 points of piercing and slashing damage (1d3 if she is Small). If she uses one of her claw attacks in concert with a weapon held in the other hand, the claw acts as a secondary natural attack instead.</p>
			<p>As the shifter gains levels, the power of her claws increases. At 3rd level, her claws ignore DR/cold iron, DR/magic, and DR/silver. At 7th level, her claw damage increases to 1d6 (1d4 if Small). At 11th level, her claw damage increases to 1d8 (1d6 if Small). At 13th level, her claw damage increases to 1d10 (1d8 if Small). At 17th level, the damage die does not increase, but the critical multiplier becomes &#215;3. Lastly, at 19th level, the claws ignore DR/adamantine and DR/&#151;.</p>
			<p>While a shifter uses wild shape to assume her aspect&#146;s major form, her natural attacks gain the same benefits granted by her shifter claws ability. If the form she takes has claw attacks, she can use either the base damage of her shifter claws or the damage of the form&#146;s claws, whichever is greater. If the form does not have claw attacks, she can choose up to two natural attacks that would deal less damage than her shifter claw damage and have those attacks instead deal the same damage as her shifter claws.</p>
			<p><b>Shifter&#146;s Slam (Ex): </b>This ability functions as the shifter claws class feature, except the leafshifter gains two slam attacks instead of two claw attacks. These slam attacks are made with her arms, which are covered in jagged bark and thorns, so these attacks deal bludgeoning and piercing damage.</p>
			<p>This alters shifter claws.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A shifter can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 93). The shifter rolls 1d20 and adds her shifter level and Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild empathy, the shifter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another and under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The shifter can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Defensive Instinct (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, when unarmored, not using a shield, unencumbered, and conscious, the shifter adds her Wisdom bonus (if any) to her AC and CMD. If she is wearing nonmetal armor or using a nonmetal shield, she instead adds half her Wisdom bonus to her AC (minimum 0). In addition, the shifter gains a +1 bonus to her AC and CMD at 4th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 shifter levels thereafter (up to a maximum of +5 at 20th level).</p>
			<p>These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks and when the shifter is flatfooted. She loses these bonuses when she is immobilized or helpless. These bonuses do not stack with the monk AC bonus class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a shifter adds half her level as a bonus on Survival checks to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a shifter can move through any sort of undergrowth (such as briars, natural thorns, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Briars, thorns, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion still affect the shifter.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su): </b>At 4th level, a shifter gains the ability to turn herself into the major form of one of her aspects and back again. This ability functions as beast shape II, except as noted here. The shifter can turn into the major form of only one of her aspects at a time. Using wild shape to change to a major form or back is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke attacks of opportunity. Often a particular aspect&#146;s major form grants abilities beyond the normal effect of beast shape II. Each major form details the abilities the shifter gains with that major form and at what level; she gains these instead of the form abilities from beast shape II, but she still gains beast shape II abilities that are size dependent.</p>
			<p>A shifter loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal of that form can make, but she can communicate with other animals of the same general grouping as her form. She can also communicate in nonverbal ways with allies.</p>
			<p>A shifter can use wild shape for a number of hours each day equal to her shifter level + her Wisdom modifier. It need not be consecutive but must be spent in 1 hour increments. For abilities that function based on &#145;uses of wild shape,&#146; each hour of wild shape counts as a use.</p>
			<p>A shifters can take feats and other abilities that require wild shape; for the purpose of qualifying for prerequisites, her effective druid level is equal to her shifter level.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a shifter leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She can choose to leave a trail if she so desires.</p>
			<p><b>Shifter&#146;s Fury (Ex): </b>At level 6, a shifter gains the ability to make several ferocious attacks with the same natural weapon. Instead of attacking with all her natural weapons, the shifter can choose a single natural weapon and make a full attack with that natural weapon, gaining a second iterative attack at a &#150;5 as if it was a manufactured weapon. When she does so, all her other natural attacks count as secondary attacks and don&#146;t benefit from shifter&#146;s claws. At 11th level, she gains a third iterative attack at a &#150;10 and at 16th level, she gains a fourth iterative attack at &#150;15.</p>
			<p><b>Chimeric Aspect (Su): </b>At 9th level, when a shifter uses her shifter aspect ability to take on a minor form, she can choose two aspects and assume the minor form of each aspect.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Chimeric Aspect (Su): </b>At 14th level, when a shifter uses her shifter aspect ability to take on a minor form, she can choose up to three aspects and assume the minor form of each aspect.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su): </b>At 18th level, a shifter gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the alter self spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 18th level, a shifter no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the shifter still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>
			<p><b>Final Aspect (Su): </b>At 20th level, a shifter gains access to a fifth aspect, and when she uses shifter&#146;s aspect, she can assume the minor forms of all her aspects and the shifter can use her major and minor forms at will.</p>
			<h>Speaking Druidic</h>
			<p>For the purposes of teaching and learning the Druidic language, shifters are considered to be druids&#151;the nuances of the language are instrumental in teaching characters of both classes to use and control their abilities. While the rare druidic circle might bar shifters from its order, and while some eccentric shifters may view druids as competitors or even enemies, all shifters are assumed to speak it.</p>
			<h>Ex-Shifters</h>
			<p>A shifter who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a non-druid or a non-shifter loses all her supernatural abilities. She cannot thereafter gain levels as a shifter until she atones (see the atonement spell description on page 245 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<h>Plant Focus Abilities</h>
			<p>Assassin Vine: The creature gains a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to grapple. This bonus increases to +3 at 8th level and +4 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Brambles: When the creature is hit by an unarmed strike or natural attack, the attacker takes 1 point of piercing damage. This increases to 2 points at 8th level and 3 points at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Creeping Vine: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Climb checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Giant Flytrap: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Stealth checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Mushroom: The creature gains a +4 enhancement bonus on saves against poison. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Oak: The creature gains a +2 enhancement bonus to CMD. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Shrieker: The creature gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet. At 8th level, the range increases by 30 feet. At 15th level, the creature also gains blindsense with a range of 10 feet.</p>
			<p>Spore: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Fly checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p>
			<p>Water Lily: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Swim checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p>

This magical transformation is fueled as much by the shifter&#146;s faith in the natural world as it is by inborn talent. The claws on each hand can be used as a primary natural attack, dealing 1d4 points of piercing and slashing damage (1d3 if she is Small). If she uses one of her claw attacks in concert with a weapon held in the other hand, the claw acts as a secondary natural attack instead.</p>
					<p>As the shifter gains levels, the power of her claws increases. At 3rd level, her claws ignore DR/cold iron, DR/magic, and DR/silver. At 7th level, her claw damage increases to 1d6 (1d4 if Small). At 11th level, her claw damage increases to 1d8 (1d6 if Small). At 13th level, her claw damage increases to 1d10 (1d8 if Small). At 17th level, the damage die does not increase, but the critical multiplier becomes &#215;3. Lastly, at 19th level, the claws ignore DR/adamantine and DR/&#151;.</p>
					<p>While a shifter uses wild shape to assume her aspect&#146;s major form, her natural attacks gain the same benefits granted by her shifter claws ability. If the form she takes has claw attacks, she can use either the base damage of her shifter claws or the damage of the form&#146;s claws, whichever is greater. If the form does not have claw attacks, she can choose up to two natural attacks that would deal less damage than her shifter claw damage and have those attacks instead deal the same damage as her shifter claws.</p>

				<name type="string">Wild Empathy</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A shifter can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 93). The shifter rolls 1d20 and adds her shifter level and Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild empathy, the shifter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another and under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
					<p>The shifter can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Thousands of gods are venerated in Vudra, and devoted followers might have personal relationships with their chosen deities. Holy beast shifters pledge to hunt down their deity&#146;s enemies to earn that deity&#146;s blessing. These shifters tend to take on the aspect of their deity&#146;s sacred animal, and many of them seek to destroy rakshasas.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether riding on the wind as a falcon or hiding in some fetid bog waiting to strike, the shifter is a true master of the wild. Both a devoted defender of druidic circles and a fierce predator, the shifter can take on the forms of nature and even fuse them together with devastating effect and unbridled savagery. By way of the druidic discipline of wild shape, they become living aspects of the wild. At first, they are able to assume only a minor aspect, but with time and practice they can fully transform into ever more powerful forms.</p>
			<p>The shifter class offers players a way to experience a shapeshifting character that is more martially inclined than a spellcasting druid. With each new level, the shifter&#146;s powers grow in new and surprising ways, creating a character that thrives in battle, exploration, and stealth.</p>
			<p>Shifters are protectors of druidic circles and avengers of nature, yet a shifter&#146;s magic is different from that of her druidic kin. Rather than invoking spells from the natural world or forging alliances with animals, shifters focus their supernatural powers inward to gain control over their own forms. Their ability to change their forms is as varied as the wonders of the wilds themselves but always remains at least partially rooted in the natural world. There are many paths to becoming a shifter; most are trained in that role by druidic circles and have their powers unlocked via rituals of initiation. Yet some stumble upon the gift naturally, as if their blood bore the secrets of shifter transformation.</p>
			<p>For those leaning toward the causes of law and good, the path of the shifter is one of contemplation and understanding. They become one with nature through mental and physical mimicry and gain an ever deeper spiritual understanding of the ebb and flow of the natural world. Those leaning toward the chaotic and evil teachings of druidic philosophy find such enlightenment through more violent means. These are typically quicker transformations, both brutal and painful, imparting the dark lessons of nature through its most catastrophic forms. Shifters who lean toward true neutrality are the most diverse when it comes to their command of metamorphic secrets.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The shifter is so attuned to nature and the wild beasts of the world that she can call upon those powers to mystically fortify her being. Fluid in form and function, she can shape herself to overcome hardships and support those she befriends or serves.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any neutral.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p>S <b>tarting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shifter's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A shifter is proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. She is also proficient with the natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) from the shifter claws class feature and of forms she assumes with wild shape.</p>
			<p>Shifters are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor. A shifter can wear wooden armor that has been altered by the ironwood spell so that it functions as if it were steel. Shifters are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A shifter who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to use her shifter aspect, shifter claws, wild shape, and other shifter supernatural or spell-like abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Beast&#146;s Blessing: </b>A holy beast must worship a deity.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages: </b>A shifter&#146;s bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures, and Aklo, the tongue spoken by certain sinister fey or otherworldly denizens of reaches of the wild rarely explored by humanity. These choices are in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A shifter speaks Druidic, a secret language known only to druids and shifters, which she learns upon becoming a 1stlevel shifter. Druidic is a free language for a shifter; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages, and it doesn&#146;t take up a language slot. Shifters are forbidden to teach this language to non-druids or non-shifters.</p>
			<p><b>Blessed Claws (Su): </b>This ability functions as the shifter&#146;s claws class feature, except the holy beast shifter&#146;s default claws are long and thin, dealing piercing damage. At 3rd level, her claws are treated as one type of aligned weapon (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) within one step of her deity&#146;s alignment in addition to ignoring DR/cold iron, DR/magic, and DR/silver. If multiple alignment components are available to the holy beast, she selects one; this choice cannot be changed later.</p>
			<p>This alters shifter claws.</p>
			<p><b>Divine Fury (Su): </b>A holy beast shifter focuses entirely on hunting down specific outsiders on behalf of her deity. She gains the ranger&#146;s favored enemy class feature, except she can select only an outsider type from the favored enemy table. The bonus against her favored enemy automatically increases by 1 at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, she can forgo gaining an additional shifter aspect to instead gain an additional outsider type as her favored enemy. Her bonuses from the favored enemy feature against new outsider types chosen in this way are equal to the bonus for the type chosen at 1st level.</p>
			<p>This replaces wild empathy, track, woodland stride, and trackless step.</p>
			<p><b>Shifter Aspect (Su): </b>At 1st level, a shifter gains her first aspect&#151;a category of animal to which her body and soul have become supernaturally attuned. She can shift into her aspect&#146;s minor form (see Aspects on page 28) for a number of minutes per day equal to 3 + her shifter level. The duration need not be consecutive but must be spent in 1-minute increments. Shifting into a minor form is a swift action, while ending the effect is a free action that can be taken only on the shifter&#146;s turn. Until a shifter reaches 9th level and gains the chimeric aspect class feature, she can assume only one minor form at a time. Shifting to a new aspect (or aspects, in the case of chimeric aspects or greater chimeric aspects) ends all minor forms currently manifested. The minor forms of aspects are not polymorph effects, and the shifter does not lose the benefits of a minor form while affected by polymorph effects.</p>
			<p>As the shifter gains levels, she gains more aspects; she gains her second aspect at 5th level, a third aspect at 10th level, and a fourth at 15th level. Aspects are detailed in their own section starting on page 28.</p>
			<p><b>Shifter Claws (Su): </b>At will, a shifter in her natural form can extend her claws as a swift action to use as a weapon. This magical transformation is fueled as much by the shifter&#146;s faith in the natural world as it is by inborn talent. The claws on each hand can be used as a primary natural attack, dealing 1d4 points of piercing and slashing damage (1d3 if she is Small). If she uses one of her claw attacks in concert with a weapon held in the other hand, the claw acts as a secondary natural attack instead.</p>
			<p>As the shifter gains levels, the power of her claws increases. At 3rd level, her claws ignore DR/cold iron, DR/magic, and DR/silver. At 7th level, her claw damage increases to 1d6 (1d4 if Small). At 11th level, her claw damage increases to 1d8 (1d6 if Small). At 13th level, her claw damage increases to 1d10 (1d8 if Small). At 17th level, the damage die does not increase, but the critical multiplier becomes &#215;3. Lastly, at 19th level, the claws ignore DR/adamantine and DR/&#151;.</p>
			<p>While a shifter uses wild shape to assume her aspect&#146;s major form, her natural attacks gain the same benefits granted by her shifter claws ability. If the form she takes has claw attacks, she can use either the base damage of her shifter claws or the damage of the form&#146;s claws, whichever is greater. If the form does not have claw attacks, she can choose up to two natural attacks that would deal less damage than her shifter claw damage and have those attacks instead deal the same damage as her shifter claws.</p>
			<p><b>Defensive Instinct (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, when unarmored, not using a shield, unencumbered, and conscious, the shifter adds her Wisdom bonus (if any) to her AC and CMD. If she is wearing nonmetal armor or using a nonmetal shield, she instead adds half her Wisdom bonus to her AC (minimum 0). In addition, the shifter gains a +1 bonus to her AC and CMD at 4th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 shifter levels thereafter (up to a maximum of +5 at 20th level).</p>
			<p>These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks and when the shifter is flatfooted. She loses these bonuses when she is immobilized or helpless. These bonuses do not stack with the monk AC bonus class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su): </b>At 4th level, a shifter gains the ability to turn herself into the major form of one of her aspects and back again. This ability functions as beast shape II, except as noted here. The shifter can turn into the major form of only one of her aspects at a time. Using wild shape to change to a major form or back is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke attacks of opportunity. Often a particular aspect&#146;s major form grants abilities beyond the normal effect of beast shape II. Each major form details the abilities the shifter gains with that major form and at what level; she gains these instead of the form abilities from beast shape II, but she still gains beast shape II abilities that are size dependent.</p>
			<p>A shifter loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal of that form can make, but she can communicate with other animals of the same general grouping as her form. She can also communicate in nonverbal ways with allies.</p>
			<p>A shifter can use wild shape for a number of hours each day equal to her shifter level + her Wisdom modifier. It need not be consecutive but must be spent in 1 hour increments. For abilities that function based on &#145;uses of wild shape,&#146; each hour of wild shape counts as a use.</p>
			<p>A shifters can take feats and other abilities that require wild shape; for the purpose of qualifying for prerequisites, her effective druid level is equal to her shifter level.</p>
			<p><b>Shifter&#146;s Fury (Ex): </b>At level 6, a shifter gains the ability to make several ferocious attacks with the same natural weapon. Instead of attacking with all her natural weapons, the shifter can choose a single natural weapon and make a full attack with that natural weapon, gaining a second iterative attack at a &#150;5 as if it was a manufactured weapon. When she does so, all her other natural attacks count as secondary attacks and don&#146;t benefit from shifter&#146;s claws. At 11th level, she gains a third iterative attack at a &#150;10 and at 16th level, she gains a fourth iterative attack at &#150;15.</p>
			<p><b>Chimeric Aspect (Su): </b>At 9th level, when a shifter uses her shifter aspect ability to take on a minor form, she can choose two aspects and assume the minor form of each aspect.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Chimeric Aspect (Su): </b>At 14th level, when a shifter uses her shifter aspect ability to take on a minor form, she can choose up to three aspects and assume the minor form of each aspect.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su): </b>At 18th level, a shifter gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the alter self spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 18th level, a shifter no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the shifter still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>
			<p><b>Final Aspect (Su): </b>At 20th level, a shifter gains access to a fifth aspect, and when she uses shifter&#146;s aspect, she can assume the minor forms of all her aspects and the shifter can use her major and minor forms at will.</p>
			<h>Speaking Druidic</h>
			<p>For the purposes of teaching and learning the Druidic language, shifters are considered to be druids&#151;the nuances of the language are instrumental in teaching characters of both classes to use and control their abilities. While the rare druidic circle might bar shifters from its order, and while some eccentric shifters may view druids as competitors or even enemies, all shifters are assumed to speak it.</p>
			<h>Ex-Shifters</h>
			<p>A shifter who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a non-druid or a non-shifter loses all her supernatural abilities. She cannot thereafter gain levels as a shifter until she atones (see the atonement spell description on page 245 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<h>Alternate Natural Attacks</h>
			<p>A shifter can draw on her chosen animal aspect to transform her hands into deadly weapons, as represented by the shifter&#146;s claws class feature, but not every animal has prominent claws. The following list provides alternate natural attacks for the shifter claws class feature. Each time the shifter activates her shifter&#146;s claws ability in her natural form, she can manifest one of the alternate natural attacks listed below for any of her chosen aspects, or those that relate to her archetype. Each alternate natural attack replaces one of the shifter&#146;s claw attacks. The shifter can gain up to two different alternate natural attacks with this method. These alternate natural attacks modify only the damage type of the shifter&#146;s natural attacks and otherwise function exactly as the shifter claws class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Bat: </b>Bite (B, P, S), wing (B).</p>
			<p><b>Bear: </b>Bite (B, P, S).</p>

					<p>At will, a shifter in her natural form can extend her claws as a swift action to use as a weapon. This magical transformation is fueled as much by the shifter&#146;s faith in the natural world as it is by inborn talent. The claws on each hand can be used as a primary natural attack, dealing 1d4 points of piercing and slashing damage (1d3 if she is Small). If she uses one of her claw attacks in concert with a weapon held in the other hand, the claw acts as a secondary natural attack instead.</p>
					<p>As the shifter gains levels, the power of her claws increases. At 3rd level, her claws ignore DR/cold iron, DR/magic, and DR/silver. At 7th level, her claw damage increases to 1d6 (1d4 if Small). At 11th level, her claw damage increases to 1d8 (1d6 if Small). At 13th level, her claw damage increases to 1d10 (1d8 if Small). At 17th level, the damage die does not increase, but the critical multiplier becomes &#215;3. Lastly, at 19th level, the claws ignore DR/adamantine and DR/&#151;.</p>
					<p>While a shifter uses wild shape to assume her aspect&#146;s major form, her natural attacks gain the same benefits granted by her shifter claws ability.

The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>By forging dark pacts with extraplanar forces, fiendflesh shifters invoke sinister powers to assume the strengths of daemons, demons, or devils. Fiendflesh shifters care nothing for the natural world and are instead consumed by an ever-growing lust for power at any price. To other shifters, the fiendflesh shifter is often viewed as a monster herself&#151;an intrusion into the natural order of things and a foe who must be sought out and destroyed. Very few druids will ever willingly ally with fiendflesh shifters; this leaves these outcasts to live bitter, lonely lives or to seek out fiendish cults or other abhorrent faiths for support and companionship.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether riding on the wind as a falcon or hiding in some fetid bog waiting to strike, the shifter is a true master of the wild. Both a devoted defender of druidic circles and a fierce predator, the shifter can take on the forms of nature and even fuse them together with devastating effect and unbridled savagery. By way of the druidic discipline of wild shape, they become living aspects of the wild. At first, they are able to assume only a minor aspect, but with time and practice they can fully transform into ever more powerful forms.</p>
			<p>The shifter class offers players a way to experience a shapeshifting character that is more martially inclined than a spellcasting druid. With each new level, the shifter&#146;s powers grow in new and surprising ways, creating a character that thrives in battle, exploration, and stealth.</p>
			<p>Shifters are protectors of druidic circles and avengers of nature, yet a shifter&#146;s magic is different from that of her druidic kin. Rather than invoking spells from the natural world or forging alliances with animals, shifters focus their supernatural powers inward to gain control over their own forms. Their ability to change their forms is as varied as the wonders of the wilds themselves but always remains at least partially rooted in the natural world. There are many paths to becoming a shifter; most are trained in that role by druidic circles and have their powers unlocked via rituals of initiation. Yet some stumble upon the gift naturally, as if their blood bore the secrets of shifter transformation.</p>
			<p>For those leaning toward the causes of law and good, the path of the shifter is one of contemplation and understanding. They become one with nature through mental and physical mimicry and gain an ever deeper spiritual understanding of the ebb and flow of the natural world. Those leaning toward the chaotic and evil teachings of druidic philosophy find such enlightenment through more violent means. These are typically quicker transformations, both brutal and painful, imparting the dark lessons of nature through its most catastrophic forms. Shifters who lean toward true neutrality are the most diverse when it comes to their command of metamorphic secrets.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The shifter is so attuned to nature and the wild beasts of the world that she can call upon those powers to mystically fortify her being. Fluid in form and function, she can shape herself to overcome hardships and support those she befriends or serves.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>A fiendflesh shifter must be evil in alignment. If the fiendflesh shifter becomes nonevil, she loses all powers granted by this archetype.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p>S <b>tarting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shifter's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p>At 20th level, the fiendflesh shifter&#146;s DR increases to 10/good. She also gains immunity to electricity and fire and spell resistance equal to 15 + her shifter level.</p>
			<p>This replaces wild shape, shifter aspect, and all improvements to shifter aspect.</p>
			<p><b>Infernal Claws (Ex): </b>A fiendflesh shifter&#146;s claws are infused with the unholy power of the evil Outer Planes. At 1st level, a fiendflesh shifter&#146;s claws are treated as evil weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. This ability otherwise functions as the shifter claws class feature.</p>
			<p>This alters shifter claws.</p>
			<p><b>Shifter Claws (Su): </b>At will, a shifter in her natural form can extend her claws as a swift action to use as a weapon. This magical transformation is fueled as much by the shifter&#146;s faith in the natural world as it is by inborn talent. The claws on each hand can be used as a primary natural attack, dealing 1d4 points of piercing and slashing damage (1d3 if she is Small). If she uses one of her claw attacks in concert with a weapon held in the other hand, the claw acts as a secondary natural attack instead.</p>
			<p>As the shifter gains levels, the power of her claws increases. At 3rd level, her claws ignore DR/cold iron, DR/magic, and DR/silver. At 7th level, her claw damage increases to 1d6 (1d4 if Small). At 11th level, her claw damage increases to 1d8 (1d6 if Small). At 13th level, her claw damage increases to 1d10 (1d8 if Small). At 17th level, the damage die does not increase, but the critical multiplier becomes &#215;3. Lastly, at 19th level, the claws ignore DR/adamantine and DR/&#151;.</p>
			<p>While a shifter uses wild shape to assume her aspect&#146;s major form, her natural attacks gain the same benefits granted by her shifter claws ability. If the form she takes has claw attacks, she can use either the base damage of her shifter claws or the damage of the form&#146;s claws, whichever is greater. If the form does not have claw attacks, she can choose up to two natural attacks that would deal less damage than her shifter claw damage and have those attacks instead deal the same damage as her shifter claws.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A shifter can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 93). The shifter rolls 1d20 and adds her shifter level and Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild empathy, the shifter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another and under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The shifter can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Fiendish Resilience (Su): </b>At 2nd level, a fiendflesh shifter gains a +1 natural armor bonus to her AC and resistance 5 to electricity and fire, but only while unencumbered and either wearing no armor or wearing light or medium nonmetal armor. At 4th level, 12th level, and 20th level, this natural armor bonus increases by 1. At 8th level and 16th level, the fiendflesh shifter&#146;s resistance to electricity and fire increases by 5.</p>
			<p>This replaces defensive instinct.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a shifter adds half her level as a bonus on Survival checks to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a shifter can move through any sort of undergrowth (such as briars, natural thorns, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Briars, thorns, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion still affect the shifter.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a shifter leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She can choose to leave a trail if she so desires.</p>
			<p><b>Shifter&#146;s Fury (Ex): </b>At level 6, a shifter gains the ability to make several ferocious attacks with the same natural weapon. Instead of attacking with all her natural weapons, the shifter can choose a single natural weapon and make a full attack with that natural weapon, gaining a second iterative attack at a &#150;5 as if it was a manufactured weapon. When she does so, all her other natural attacks count as secondary attacks and don&#146;t benefit from shifter&#146;s claws. At 11th level, she gains a third iterative attack at a &#150;10 and at 16th level, she gains a fourth iterative attack at &#150;15.</p>
			<p><b>Chimeric Fiend (Su): </b>At 9th level, when a fiendflesh shifter uses her fiendish aspect ability, she can gain an additional ability from the list below. The fiendflesh shifter can change which ability she gains each time she uses fiendish aspect.</p>
			<p><i>Daemon: </i>Acid resistance 10 and a +4 profane bonus on saves against disease.</p>
			<p><i>Demon: </i>The shifter&#146;s electricity resistance doubles.</p>
			<p><i>Devil: </i>The shifter&#146;s fire resistance doubles.</p>
			<p>This replaces chimeric aspect.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Chimeric Fiend (Su): </b>At 14th level, a fiendflesh shifter&#146;s chimeric fiend ability grants her additional bonuses as noted below.</p>
			<p><i>Daemon: </i>The shifter gains a +4 enhancement bonus to her Constitution score and immunity to disease.</p>
			<p><i>Demon: </i>The shifter gains a +4 enhancement bonus to her Strength score and increases the damage die of all natural attacks by one step.</p>
			<p><i>Devil: </i>The shifter gains a +4 enhancement bonus to her Dexterity score and see in darkness as per the universal monster rule.</p>
			<p>This replaces greater chimeric aspect.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su): </b>At 18th level, a shifter gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the alter self spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 18th level, a shifter no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the shifter still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>
			<p><b>Final Aspect (Su): </b>At 20th level, a shifter gains access to a fifth aspect, and when she uses shifter&#146;s aspect, she can assume the minor forms of all her aspects and the shifter can use her major and minor forms at will.</p>
			<h>Speaking Druidic</h>
			<p>For the purposes of teaching and learning the Druidic language, shifters are considered to be druids&#151;the nuances of the language are instrumental in teaching characters of both classes to use and control their abilities. While the rare druidic circle might bar shifters from its order, and while some eccentric shifters may view druids as competitors or even enemies, all shifters are assumed to speak it.</p>
			<h>Ex-Shifters</h>
			<p>A shifter who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a non-druid or a non-shifter loses all her supernatural abilities. She cannot thereafter gain levels as a shifter until she atones (see the atonement spell description on page 245 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<h>Alternate Natural Attacks</h>
			<p>A shifter can draw on her chosen animal aspect to transform her hands into deadly weapons, as represented by the shifter&#146;s claws class feature, but not every animal has prominent claws. The following list provides alternate natural attacks for the shifter claws class feature. Each time the shifter activates her shifter&#146;s claws ability in her natural form, she can manifest one of the alternate natural attacks listed below for any of her chosen aspects, or those that relate to her archetype. Each alternate natural attack replaces one of the shifter&#146;s claw attacks. The shifter can gain up to two different alternate natural attacks with this method. These alternate natural attacks modify only the damage type of the shifter&#146;s natural attacks and otherwise function exactly as the shifter claws class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Bat: </b>Bite (B, P, S), wing (B).</p>
			<p><b>Bear: </b>Bite (B, P, S).</p>
			<p><b>Bull: </b>Gore (P), hoof (B), slam (B).</p>
			<p><b>Boar: </b>Gore (P), hoof (B).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Feyform shifters are intimately linked to the First World, and can draw from it to gain otherworldly powers.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether riding on the wind as a falcon or hiding in some fetid bog waiting to strike, the shifter is a true master of the wild. Both a devoted defender of druidic circles and a fierce predator, the shifter can take on the forms of nature and even fuse them together with devastating effect and unbridled savagery. By way of the druidic discipline of wild shape, they become living aspects of the wild. At first, they are able to assume only a minor aspect, but with time and practice they can fully transform into ever more powerful forms.</p>
			<p>The shifter class offers players a way to experience a shapeshifting character that is more martially inclined than a spellcasting druid. With each new level, the shifter&#146;s powers grow in new and surprising ways, creating a character that thrives in battle, exploration, and stealth.</p>
			<p>Shifters are protectors of druidic circles and avengers of nature, yet a shifter&#146;s magic is different from that of her druidic kin. Rather than invoking spells from the natural world or forging alliances with animals, shifters focus their supernatural powers inward to gain control over their own forms. Their ability to change their forms is as varied as the wonders of the wilds themselves but always remains at least partially rooted in the natural world. There are many paths to becoming a shifter; most are trained in that role by druidic circles and have their powers unlocked via rituals of initiation. Yet some stumble upon the gift naturally, as if their blood bore the secrets of shifter transformation.</p>
			<p>For those leaning toward the causes of law and good, the path of the shifter is one of contemplation and understanding. They become one with nature through mental and physical mimicry and gain an ever deeper spiritual understanding of the ebb and flow of the natural world. Those leaning toward the chaotic and evil teachings of druidic philosophy find such enlightenment through more violent means. These are typically quicker transformations, both brutal and painful, imparting the dark lessons of nature through its most catastrophic forms. Shifters who lean toward true neutrality are the most diverse when it comes to their command of metamorphic secrets.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The shifter is so attuned to nature and the wild beasts of the world that she can call upon those powers to mystically fortify her being. Fluid in form and function, she can shape herself to overcome hardships and support those she befriends or serves.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any neutral.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p>S <b>tarting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shifter's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A shifter is proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. She is also proficient with the natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) from the shifter claws class feature and of forms she assumes with wild shape.</p>
			<p>Shifters are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor. A shifter can wear wooden armor that has been altered by the ironwood spell so that it functions as if it were steel. Shifters are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A shifter who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to use her shifter aspect, shifter claws, wild shape, and other shifter supernatural or spell-like abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages: </b>A shifter&#146;s bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures, and Aklo, the tongue spoken by certain sinister fey or otherworldly denizens of reaches of the wild rarely explored by humanity. These choices are in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A shifter speaks Druidic, a secret language known only to druids and shifters, which she learns upon becoming a 1stlevel shifter. Druidic is a free language for a shifter; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages, and it doesn&#146;t take up a language slot. Shifters are forbidden to teach this language to non-druids or non-shifters.</p>
			<p><b>Fey Aspect (Su): </b>A feyform shifter can take on a First World aspect and assume fey traits as a swift action. While in this form, she gains low-light vision (or darkvision with a range of 30 feet, if she already has low-light vision) and DR 1/cold iron. Her body outline becomes indistinct; she is treated as though she has concealment, except that she cannot use this concealment to attempt Stealth checks. She can maintain this form for a number of minutes per day equal to 3 + her shifter level. The duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments.</p>
			<p>At 5th level, the feyform shifter&#146;s DR increases to 2/cold iron, and she grows a pair of butterfly-like wings that grant her a fly speed of 30 feet with average maneuverability.</p>
			<p>At 10th level, the feyform shifter&#146;s DR increases to 5/cold iron, and she gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against enchantment spells and effects.</p>
			<p>At 15th level, the feyform shifter&#146;s DR increases to 7/cold iron, and her fly speed maneuverability increases to good.</p>
			<p>At 20th level, the feyform shifter&#146;s DR increases to 10/cold iron. She becomes resistant to movement-impairing effects (as freedom of movement) and gains spell resistance equal to 10 + her level.</p>
			<p>This alters and replaces all improvements to shifter aspect.</p>
			<p><b>Shifter Aspect (Su): </b>At 1st level, a shifter gains her first aspect&#151;a category of animal to which her body and soul have become supernaturally attuned. She can shift into her aspect&#146;s minor form (see Aspects on page 28) for a number of minutes per day equal to 3 + her shifter level. The duration need not be consecutive but must be spent in 1-minute increments. Shifting into a minor form is a swift action, while ending the effect is a free action that can be taken only on the shifter&#146;s turn. Until a shifter reaches 9th level and gains the chimeric aspect class feature, she can assume only one minor form at a time. Shifting to a new aspect (or aspects, in the case of chimeric aspects or greater chimeric aspects) ends all minor forms currently manifested. The minor forms of aspects are not polymorph effects, and the shifter does not lose the benefits of a minor form while affected by polymorph effects.</p>
			<p>As the shifter gains levels, she gains more aspects; she gains her second aspect at 5th level, a third aspect at 10th level, and a fourth at 15th level. Aspects are detailed in their own section starting on page 28.</p>
			<p><b>Shifter Claws (Su): </b>At will, a shifter in her natural form can extend her claws as a swift action to use as a weapon. This magical transformation is fueled as much by the shifter&#146;s faith in the natural world as it is by inborn talent. The claws on each hand can be used as a primary natural attack, dealing 1d4 points of piercing and slashing damage (1d3 if she is Small). If she uses one of her claw attacks in concert with a weapon held in the other hand, the claw acts as a secondary natural attack instead.</p>
			<p>As the shifter gains levels, the power of her claws increases. At 3rd level, her claws ignore DR/cold iron, DR/magic, and DR/silver. At 7th level, her claw damage increases to 1d6 (1d4 if Small). At 11th level, her claw damage increases to 1d8 (1d6 if Small). At 13th level, her claw damage increases to 1d10 (1d8 if Small). At 17th level, the damage die does not increase, but the critical multiplier becomes &#215;3. Lastly, at 19th level, the claws ignore DR/adamantine and DR/&#151;.</p>
			<p>While a shifter uses wild shape to assume her aspect&#146;s major form, her natural attacks gain the same benefits granted by her shifter claws ability. If the form she takes has claw attacks, she can use either the base damage of her shifter claws or the damage of the form&#146;s claws, whichever is greater. If the form does not have claw attacks, she can choose up to two natural attacks that would deal less damage than her shifter claw damage and have those attacks instead deal the same damage as her shifter claws.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A shifter can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 93). The shifter rolls 1d20 and adds her shifter level and Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild empathy, the shifter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another and under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The shifter can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Defensive Instinct (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, when unarmored, not using a shield, unencumbered, and conscious, the shifter adds her Wisdom bonus (if any) to her AC and CMD. If she is wearing nonmetal armor or using a nonmetal shield, she instead adds half her Wisdom bonus to her AC (minimum 0). In addition, the shifter gains a +1 bonus to her AC and CMD at 4th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 shifter levels thereafter (up to a maximum of +5 at 20th level).</p>
			<p>These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks and when the shifter is flatfooted. She loses these bonuses when she is immobilized or helpless. These bonuses do not stack with the monk AC bonus class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a shifter adds half her level as a bonus on Survival checks to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a shifter can move through any sort of undergrowth (such as briars, natural thorns, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Briars, thorns, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion still affect the shifter.</p>
			<p><b>Fey Shape (Su): </b>At 4th level, a feyform shifter can use her wild shape ability to become a fey creature. The fey shifter must spend at least one use of wild shape to transform into a fey creature; this ability functions as fey form I, except that it lasts for only 1 minute per use of wild shape spent. Using fey shape or reverting back is a standard action that does not cause attacks of opportunity. At 8th level this ability instead functions as fey form II. At 10th level this ability functions as fey form III, and at 14th level it functions as fey form IV.</p>
			<p>This alters wild shape.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su): </b>At 4th level, a shifter gains the ability to turn herself into the major form of one of her aspects and back again. This ability functions as beast shape II, except as noted here. The shifter can turn into the major form of only one of her aspects at a time. Using wild shape to change to a major form or back is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke attacks of opportunity. Often a particular aspect&#146;s major form grants abilities beyond the normal effect of beast shape II. Each major form details the abilities the shifter gains with that major form and at what level; she gains these instead of the form abilities from beast shape II, but she still gains beast shape II abilities that are size dependent.</p>
			<p>A shifter loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal of that form can make, but she can communicate with other animals of the same general grouping as her form. She can also communicate in nonverbal ways with allies.</p>
			<p>A shifter can use wild shape for a number of hours each day equal to her shifter level + her Wisdom modifier. It need not be consecutive but must be spent in 1 hour increments. For abilities that function based on &#145;uses of wild shape,&#146; each hour of wild shape counts as a use.</p>
			<p>A shifters can take feats and other abilities that require wild shape; for the purpose of qualifying for prerequisites, her effective druid level is equal to her shifter level.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a shifter leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She can choose to leave a trail if she so desires.</p>
			<p><b>Shifter&#146;s Fury (Ex): </b>At level 6, a shifter gains the ability to make several ferocious attacks with the same natural weapon. Instead of attacking with all her natural weapons, the shifter can choose a single natural weapon and make a full attack with that natural weapon, gaining a second iterative attack at a &#150;5 as if it was a manufactured weapon. When she does so, all her other natural attacks count as secondary attacks and don&#146;t benefit from shifter&#146;s claws. At 11th level, she gains a third iterative attack at a &#150;10 and at 16th level, she gains a fourth iterative attack at &#150;15.</p>
			<p><b>Chimeric Aspect (Su): </b>At 9th level, when a shifter uses her shifter aspect ability to take on a minor form, she can choose two aspects and assume the minor form of each aspect.</p>
			<p><b>Fey Shifter (Su): </b>At 9th level, a feyform shifter gains a second shifter aspect, chosen from the animal aspects normally available to shifters. When she uses her shifter aspect ability to take on her fey aspect, she can choose a second aspect and assume the minor form of that aspect, alongside her fey aspect, allowing her to combine her fey aspect with the animal aspects available to her.</p>
			<p>This modifies chimeric aspect.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Chimeric Aspect (Su): </b>At 14th level, when a shifter uses her shifter aspect ability to take on a minor form, she can choose up to three aspects and assume the minor form of each aspect.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Fey Shifter (Su): </b>At 14th level, a feyform shifter gains a third aspect. When she uses her shifter aspect ability to take on her fey aspect, she can choose two aspects and assume the minor form of each aspect, alongside her fey aspect.</p>
			<p>This modifies greater chimeric aspect.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su): </b>At 18th level, a shifter gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the alter self spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 18th level, a shifter no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the shifter still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>
			<p><b>Final Aspect (Su): </b>At 20th level, a feyform shifter gains access to a fourth aspect. When she uses shifter aspect, she can assume the minor forms of all her aspects in addition to her fey aspect, and she can use her major and minor forms at will.</p>
			<p>This alters final aspect.</p>
			<h>Speaking Druidic</h>
			<p>For the purposes of teaching and learning the Druidic language, shifters are considered to be druids&#151;the nuances of the language are instrumental in teaching characters of both classes to use and control their abilities. While the rare druidic circle might bar shifters from its order, and while some eccentric shifters may view druids as competitors or even enemies, all shifters are assumed to speak it.</p>
			<h>Ex-Shifters</h>
			<p>A shifter who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a non-druid or a non-shifter loses all her supernatural abilities. She cannot thereafter gain levels as a shifter until she atones (see the atonement spell description on page 245 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<h>Alternate Natural Attacks</h>
			<p>A shifter can draw on her chosen animal aspect to transform her hands into deadly weapons, as represented by the shifter&#146;s claws class feature, but not every animal has prominent claws. The following list provides alternate natural attacks for the shifter claws class feature. Each time the shifter activates her shifter&#146;s claws ability in her natural form, she can manifest one of the alternate natural attacks listed below for any of her chosen aspects, or those that relate to her archetype. Each alternate natural attack replaces one of the shifter&#146;s claw attacks. The shifter can gain up to two different alternate natural attacks with this method. These alternate natural attacks modify only the damage type of the shifter&#146;s natural attacks and otherwise function exactly as the shifter claws class feature.</p>

			<p><b>Bear: </b>Bite (B, P, S).</p>

Shifters are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
					<p>A shifter who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to use her shifter aspect, shifter claws, wild shape, and other shifter supernatural or spell-like abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>

The shifter can turn into the major form of only one of her aspects at a time. Using wild shape to change to a major form or back is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke attacks of opportunity. Often a particular aspect&#146;s major form grants abilities beyond the normal effect of beast shape II.

					<p>At 9th level, an elementalist shifter can fuse two elemental forms together, gaining combined powers of the different aspects and manifesting them in ways that bring to mind powerful natural weather phenomena. When the elementalist shifter takes on one minor form each from two of her elemental aspects, she gains an additional ability as long as she maintains the form. The effects of the abilities depend on the elemental combination, as detailed below.</p>
					<p>Ash Storm (Su): By combining air and fire, the elementalist shifter surrounds herself with a storm of swirling ash, granting her a 20% miss chance against ranged attacks.</p>
					<p>Downpour (Su): The elementalist shifter combines the powers of air and water to generate a torrential downpour in her square and squares adjacent to her. This rain automatically extinguishes all nonmagical fires in her square and squares adjacent to her (including flames on creatures that have caught on fire). It also has a chance to extinguish ongoing magical fire (but not instantaneous magical fire effects such as fireball) within or that enters the area, as if the elementalist shifter had cast dispel magic, using her elementalist shifter level as her caster level for the effect.</p>
					<p>Mudslide (Su): Combining the elements of earth and water causes the elementalist shifter to generate an aura of mud. This mud extends out to all squares adjacent to her and counts as difficult terrain; it moves with her and vanishes when she ends her elemental aspect.</p>
					<p>Sandstorm (Su): Combining the high winds of air and fine particulates of earth produces a sandstorm that extends out to a radius of 20 feet from the elementalist shifter. All light levels in the area diminish by one step, and creatures caught in the effect take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage each round they remain within the sandstorm.</p>
					<p>Steam Cloud (Su) When the elementalist shifter enters a minor form of fire and water at the same time, the heat of fire and moisture of water generate an explosive area of steam around her out to a radius of 20 feet as per obscuring mist. The mist remains in place until she ends her elemental aspect; it doesn&#146;t move with her.</p>
					<p>Volcanic Stride (Su): By combining earth and fire, the elementalist shifter can damage the ground around herself. As a standard action, she can deform a region of natural or artificial rock in her space, turning it into difficult terrain and causing creatures that pass through it to take an amount of fire damage equal to that dealt by her elemental strike with no save. Affected terrain remains transformed until the shifter ends her elemental aspect.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Rather than drawing power from bestial aspects, elementalist shifters channel power from the Inner Sphere and can take on powerful elemental forms at the cost of the greater diversity available to traditional shifters. Although the elementalist shifter&#146;s powers seem more outlandish and supernatural than those of others of their kind, they remain equally immersed in the druidic traditions; their focus is simply rooted in expressions of nature found in extraplanar regions: the planes of Air, Earth, Fire, and Water.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether riding on the wind as a falcon or hiding in some fetid bog waiting to strike, the shifter is a true master of the wild. Both a devoted defender of druidic circles and a fierce predator, the shifter can take on the forms of nature and even fuse them together with devastating effect and unbridled savagery. By way of the druidic discipline of wild shape, they become living aspects of the wild. At first, they are able to assume only a minor aspect, but with time and practice they can fully transform into ever more powerful forms.</p>
			<p>The shifter class offers players a way to experience a shapeshifting character that is more martially inclined than a spellcasting druid. With each new level, the shifter&#146;s powers grow in new and surprising ways, creating a character that thrives in battle, exploration, and stealth.</p>
			<p>Shifters are protectors of druidic circles and avengers of nature, yet a shifter&#146;s magic is different from that of her druidic kin. Rather than invoking spells from the natural world or forging alliances with animals, shifters focus their supernatural powers inward to gain control over their own forms. Their ability to change their forms is as varied as the wonders of the wilds themselves but always remains at least partially rooted in the natural world. There are many paths to becoming a shifter; most are trained in that role by druidic circles and have their powers unlocked via rituals of initiation. Yet some stumble upon the gift naturally, as if their blood bore the secrets of shifter transformation.</p>
			<p>For those leaning toward the causes of law and good, the path of the shifter is one of contemplation and understanding. They become one with nature through mental and physical mimicry and gain an ever deeper spiritual understanding of the ebb and flow of the natural world. Those leaning toward the chaotic and evil teachings of druidic philosophy find such enlightenment through more violent means. These are typically quicker transformations, both brutal and painful, imparting the dark lessons of nature through its most catastrophic forms. Shifters who lean toward true neutrality are the most diverse when it comes to their command of metamorphic secrets.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The shifter is so attuned to nature and the wild beasts of the world that she can call upon those powers to mystically fortify her being. Fluid in form and function, she can shape herself to overcome hardships and support those she befriends or serves.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any neutral.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p>S <b>tarting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shifter's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>

A shifter can wear wooden armor that has been altered by the ironwood spell so that it functions as if it were steel. Shifters are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A shifter who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to use her shifter aspect, shifter claws, wild shape, and other shifter supernatural or spell-like abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages: </b>A shifter&#146;s bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures, and Aklo, the tongue spoken by certain sinister fey or otherworldly denizens of reaches of the wild rarely explored by humanity. These choices are in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A shifter speaks Druidic, a secret language known only to druids and shifters, which she learns upon becoming a 1stlevel shifter. Druidic is a free language for a shifter; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages, and it doesn&#146;t take up a language slot. Shifters are forbidden to teach this language to non-druids or non-shifters.</p>
			<p>An elementalist shifter adds Aquan, Auran, Ignan, and Terran to her list of available bonus languages.</p>
			<p><b>Elemental Aspect (Su): </b>At 1st level, an elementalist shifter chooses one elemental aspect (see page 79) rather than a shifter aspect. This ability otherwise functions as shifter aspect. As the elementalist shifter gains levels, she gains more elemental aspects: a second aspect at 5th level, a third at 10th, and a fourth at 15th.</p>
			<p>This alters shifter aspect.</p>
			<p><b>Elemental Speech (Su): </b>When in her elemental aspect, an elementalist shifter gains the benefit of tongues with creatures of the elemental subtype that matches her elemental aspect.</p>
			<p>This replaces wild empathy.</p>
			<p><b>Elemental Strike (Su): </b>At 1st level, as a swift action, an elementalist shifter can charge her melee attacks with elemental energy. The elementalist shifter can charge her attacks only with an element she has chosen with elemental aspect. Once charged, each melee attack the elementalist shifter makes until the start of her next turn deals an additional 1d6 points of energy damage based on the element she chooses when taking this action (see Elemental Aspects on page 79). This additional damage increases by 1d6 at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, to a maximum of 6d6 points of energy damage at 20th level. An elementalist shifter can&#146;t use elemental strike while under a polymorph effect.</p>
			<p>This replaces shifter claws.</p>
			<p><b>Shifter Aspect (Su): </b>At 1st level, a shifter gains her first aspect&#151;a category of animal to which her body and soul have become supernaturally attuned. She can shift into her aspect&#146;s minor form (see Aspects on page 28) for a number of minutes per day equal to 3 + her shifter level. The duration need not be consecutive but must be spent in 1-minute increments. Shifting into a minor form is a swift action, while ending the effect is a free action that can be taken only on the shifter&#146;s turn. Until a shifter reaches 9th level and gains the chimeric aspect class feature, she can assume only one minor form at a time. Shifting to a new aspect (or aspects, in the case of chimeric aspects or greater chimeric aspects) ends all minor forms currently manifested. The minor forms of aspects are not polymorph effects, and the shifter does not lose the benefits of a minor form while affected by polymorph effects.</p>
			<p>As the shifter gains levels, she gains more aspects; she gains her second aspect at 5th level, a third aspect at 10th level, and a fourth at 15th level. Aspects are detailed in their own section starting on page 28.</p>
			<p><b>Defensive Instinct (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, when unarmored, not using a shield, unencumbered, and conscious, the shifter adds her Wisdom bonus (if any) to her AC and CMD. If she is wearing nonmetal armor or using a nonmetal shield, she instead adds half her Wisdom bonus to her AC (minimum 0). In addition, the shifter gains a +1 bonus to her AC and CMD at 4th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 shifter levels thereafter (up to a maximum of +5 at 20th level).</p>
			<p>These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks and when the shifter is flatfooted. She loses these bonuses when she is immobilized or helpless. These bonuses do not stack with the monk AC bonus class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a shifter adds half her level as a bonus on Survival checks to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a shifter can move through any sort of undergrowth (such as briars, natural thorns, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Briars, thorns, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion still affect the shifter.</p>
			<p><b>Elemental Form (Su): </b>At 4th level, when an elementalist shifter uses wild shape, she is instead affected as if by elemental body I, but she gains only the benefits listed in her elemental aspect. While in an elemental form, the elementalist shifter can speak only the elemental language associated with that form, and she can do so only if she knows it.</p>
			<p>This alters wild shape.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su): </b>At 4th level, a shifter gains the ability to turn herself into the major form of one of her aspects and back again. This ability functions as beast shape II, except as noted here. The shifter can turn into the major form of only one of her aspects at a time. Using wild shape to change to a major form or back is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke attacks of opportunity. Often a particular aspect&#146;s major form grants abilities beyond the normal effect of beast shape II. Each major form details the abilities the shifter gains with that major form and at what level; she gains these instead of the form abilities from beast shape II, but she still gains beast shape II abilities that are size dependent.</p>
			<p>A shifter loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal of that form can make, but she can communicate with other animals of the same general grouping as her form. She can also communicate in nonverbal ways with allies.</p>
			<p>A shifter can use wild shape for a number of hours each day equal to her shifter level + her Wisdom modifier. It need not be consecutive but must be spent in 1 hour increments. For abilities that function based on &#145;uses of wild shape,&#146; each hour of wild shape counts as a use.</p>
			<p>A shifters can take feats and other abilities that require wild shape; for the purpose of qualifying for prerequisites, her effective druid level is equal to her shifter level.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a shifter leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She can choose to leave a trail if she so desires.</p>
			<p><b>Shifter&#146;s Fury (Ex): </b>At level 6, a shifter gains the ability to make several ferocious attacks with the same natural weapon. Instead of attacking with all her natural weapons, the shifter can choose a single natural weapon and make a full attack with that natural weapon, gaining a second iterative attack at a &#150;5 as if it was a manufactured weapon. When she does so, all her other natural attacks count as secondary attacks and don&#146;t benefit from shifter&#146;s claws. At 11th level, she gains a third iterative attack at a &#150;10 and at 16th level, she gains a fourth iterative attack at &#150;15.</p>
			<p><b>Omnielementalist (Su): </b>At 9th level, an elementalist shifter can fuse two elemental forms together, gaining combined powers of the different aspects and manifesting them in ways that bring to mind powerful natural weather phenomena. When the elementalist shifter takes on one minor form each from two of her elemental aspects, she gains an additional ability as long as she maintains the form. The effects of the abilities depend on the elemental combination, as detailed below.</p>
			<p>Ash Storm (Su): By combining air and fire, the elementalist shifter surrounds herself with a storm of swirling ash, granting her a 20% miss chance against ranged attacks.</p>
			<p>Downpour (Su): The elementalist shifter combines the powers of air and water to generate a torrential downpour in her square and squares adjacent to her. This rain automatically extinguishes all nonmagical fires in her square and squares adjacent to her (including flames on creatures that have caught on fire). It also has a chance to extinguish ongoing magical fire (but not instantaneous magical fire effects such as fireball) within or that enters the area, as if the elementalist shifter had cast dispel magic, using her elementalist shifter level as her caster level for the effect.</p>
			<p>Mudslide (Su): Combining the elements of earth and water causes the elementalist shifter to generate an aura of mud. This mud extends out to all squares adjacent to her and counts as difficult terrain; it moves with her and vanishes when she ends her elemental aspect.</p>
			<p>Sandstorm (Su): Combining the high winds of air and fine particulates of earth produces a sandstorm that extends out to a radius of 20 feet from the elementalist shifter. All light levels in the area diminish by one step, and creatures caught in the effect take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage each round they remain within the sandstorm.</p>
			<p>Steam Cloud (Su) When the elementalist shifter enters a minor form of fire and water at the same time, the heat of fire and moisture of water generate an explosive area of steam around her out to a radius of 20 feet as per obscuring mist. The mist remains in place until she ends her elemental aspect; it doesn&#146;t move with her.</p>
			<p>Volcanic Stride (Su): By combining earth and fire, the elementalist shifter can damage the ground around herself. As a standard action, she can deform a region of natural or artificial rock in her space, turning it into difficult terrain and causing creatures that pass through it to take an amount of fire damage equal to that dealt by her elemental strike with no save. Affected terrain remains transformed until the shifter ends her elemental aspect.</p>
			<p>This replaces chimeric aspect and greater chimeric aspect.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su): </b>At 18th level, a shifter gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the alter self spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 18th level, a shifter no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the shifter still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>
			<p><b>Final Aspect (Su): </b>At 20th level, a shifter gains access to a fifth aspect, and when she uses shifter&#146;s aspect, she can assume the minor forms of all her aspects and the shifter can use her major and minor forms at will.</p>
			<h>Speaking Druidic</h>
			<p>For the purposes of teaching and learning the Druidic language, shifters are considered to be druids&#151;the nuances of the language are instrumental in teaching characters of both classes to use and control their abilities. While the rare druidic circle might bar shifters from its order, and while some eccentric shifters may view druids as competitors or even enemies, all shifters are assumed to speak it.</p>
			<h>Ex-Shifters</h>
			<p>A shifter who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a non-druid or a non-shifter loses all her supernatural abilities. She cannot thereafter gain levels as a shifter until she atones (see the atonement spell description on page 245 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<h>Alternate Natural Attacks</h>
			<p>A shifter can draw on her chosen animal aspect to transform her hands into deadly weapons, as represented by the shifter&#146;s claws class feature, but not every animal has prominent claws. The following list provides alternate natural attacks for the shifter claws class feature. Each time the shifter activates her shifter&#146;s claws ability in her natural form, she can manifest one of the alternate natural attacks listed below for any of her chosen aspects, or those that relate to her archetype. Each alternate natural attack replaces one of the shifter&#146;s claw attacks. The shifter can gain up to two different alternate natural attacks with this method. These alternate natural attacks modify only the damage type of the shifter&#146;s natural attacks and otherwise function exactly as the shifter claws class feature.</p>

				<name type="string">Draconic Aspect</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A dragonblood shifter can temporarily imbue her body with draconic majesty as a swift action. When activating this ability, the shifter must select one of the chromatic or metallic dragon types from the table below. Her draconic aspect abilities grant resistances and deal a type of damage based on the chosen dragon type. While shifted into this form, she gains the scent ability and energy resistance 5 against the energy type that corresponds to her selected dragon type. She can maintain this form for a number of minutes per day equal to 3 + her shifter level. The duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The shifter can select a different dragon type every time she uses this ability, but she must end her current draconic aspect and activate this ability again in order to change her chosen dragon type.</p>

					<p>At 5th level, the energy resistance granted by the dragonblood shifter&#146;s draconic aspect increases to 10. At 10th level, the energy resistance granted by the dragonblood shifter&#146;s draconic aspect increases to 15, and she gains a breath weapon of her energy type that deals 1d6 points of damage per shifter level within a 30-foot cone. A target can attempt a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half the dragonblood shifter&#146;s level + her Charisma modifier) to reduce damage by half. The dragonblood shifter can use her breath weapon once per day.</p>

				<name type="string">Shifter Claws</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At will, a shifter in her natural form can extend her claws as a swift action to use as a weapon. This magical transformation is fueled as much by the shifter&#146;s faith in the natural world as it is by inborn talent. The claws on each hand can be used as a primary natural attack, dealing 1d4 points of piercing and slashing damage (1d3 if she is Small). If she uses one of her claw attacks in concert with a weapon held in the other hand, the claw acts as a secondary natural attack instead.</p>
					<p>As the shifter gains levels, the power of her claws increases. At 3rd level, her claws ignore DR/cold iron, DR/magic, and DR/silver. At 7th level, her claw damage increases to 1d6 (1d4 if Small). At 11th level, her claw damage increases to 1d8 (1d6 if Small). At 13th level, her claw damage increases to 1d10 (1d8 if Small). At 17th level, the damage die does not increase, but the critical multiplier becomes &#215;3. Lastly, at 19th level, the claws ignore DR/adamantine and DR/&#151;.</p>
					<p>While a shifter uses wild shape to assume her aspect&#146;s major form, her natural attacks gain the same benefits granted by her shifter claws ability. If the form she takes has claw attacks, she can use either the base damage of her shifter claws or the damage of the form&#146;s claws, whichever is greater. If the form does not have claw attacks, she can choose up to two natural attacks that would deal less damage than her shifter claw damage and have those attacks instead deal the same damage as her shifter claws.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A shifter can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 93). The shifter rolls 1d20 and adds her shifter level and Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild empathy, the shifter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another and under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
					<p>The shifter can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>

When she does so, all her other natural attacks count as secondary attacks and don&#146;t benefit from shifter&#146;s claws. At 11th level, she gains a third iterative attack at a &#150;10 and at 16th level, she gains a fourth iterative attack at &#150;15.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Dragonblood shifters draw upon the inherent strength and majesty of the true dragons, gaining a measure of their powers from their association.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether riding on the wind as a falcon or hiding in some fetid bog waiting to strike, the shifter is a true master of the wild. Both a devoted defender of druidic circles and a fierce predator, the shifter can take on the forms of nature and even fuse them together with devastating effect and unbridled savagery. By way of the druidic discipline of wild shape, they become living aspects of the wild. At first, they are able to assume only a minor aspect, but with time and practice they can fully transform into ever more powerful forms.</p>
			<p>The shifter class offers players a way to experience a shapeshifting character that is more martially inclined than a spellcasting druid. With each new level, the shifter&#146;s powers grow in new and surprising ways, creating a character that thrives in battle, exploration, and stealth.</p>
			<p>Shifters are protectors of druidic circles and avengers of nature, yet a shifter&#146;s magic is different from that of her druidic kin. Rather than invoking spells from the natural world or forging alliances with animals, shifters focus their supernatural powers inward to gain control over their own forms. Their ability to change their forms is as varied as the wonders of the wilds themselves but always remains at least partially rooted in the natural world. There are many paths to becoming a shifter; most are trained in that role by druidic circles and have their powers unlocked via rituals of initiation. Yet some stumble upon the gift naturally, as if their blood bore the secrets of shifter transformation.</p>
			<p>For those leaning toward the causes of law and good, the path of the shifter is one of contemplation and understanding. They become one with nature through mental and physical mimicry and gain an ever deeper spiritual understanding of the ebb and flow of the natural world. Those leaning toward the chaotic and evil teachings of druidic philosophy find such enlightenment through more violent means. These are typically quicker transformations, both brutal and painful, imparting the dark lessons of nature through its most catastrophic forms. Shifters who lean toward true neutrality are the most diverse when it comes to their command of metamorphic secrets.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The shifter is so attuned to nature and the wild beasts of the world that she can call upon those powers to mystically fortify her being. Fluid in form and function, she can shape herself to overcome hardships and support those she befriends or serves.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any neutral.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p>S <b>tarting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shifter's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A shifter is proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. She is also proficient with the natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) from the shifter claws class feature and of forms she assumes with wild shape.</p>
			<p>Shifters are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor. A shifter can wear wooden armor that has been altered by the ironwood spell so that it functions as if it were steel. Shifters are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A shifter who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to use her shifter aspect, shifter claws, wild shape, and other shifter supernatural or spell-like abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages: </b>A shifter&#146;s bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures, and Aklo, the tongue spoken by certain sinister fey or otherworldly denizens of reaches of the wild rarely explored by humanity. These choices are in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A shifter speaks Druidic, a secret language known only to druids and shifters, which she learns upon becoming a 1stlevel shifter. Druidic is a free language for a shifter; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages, and it doesn&#146;t take up a language slot. Shifters are forbidden to teach this language to non-druids or non-shifters.</p>
			<p><b>Draconic Aspect (Su): </b>A dragonblood shifter can temporarily imbue her body with draconic majesty as a swift action. When activating this ability, the shifter must select one of the chromatic or metallic dragon types from the table below. Her draconic aspect abilities grant resistances and deal a type of damage based on the chosen dragon type. While shifted into this form, she gains the scent ability and energy resistance 5 against the energy type that corresponds to her selected dragon type. She can maintain this form for a number of minutes per day equal to 3 + her shifter level. The duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The shifter can select a different dragon type every time she uses this ability, but she must end her current draconic aspect and activate this ability again in order to change her chosen dragon type.</p>

			<p>At 5th level, the energy resistance granted by the dragonblood shifter&#146;s draconic aspect increases to 10. At 10th level, the energy resistance granted by the dragonblood shifter&#146;s draconic aspect increases to 15, and she gains a breath weapon of her energy type that deals 1d6 points of damage per shifter level within a 30-foot cone. A target can attempt a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half the dragonblood shifter&#146;s level + her Charisma modifier) to reduce damage by half. The dragonblood shifter can use her breath weapon once per day.</p>
			<p>At 15th level, the energy resistance granted by the dragonblood shifter&#146;s draconic aspect increases to 20, and she can use her breath weapon twice per day.</p>
			<p>At 20th level, the dragonblood shifter becomes immune to the energy type that corresponds to her selected dragon type while in her draconic aspect. In addition, she gains spell resistance equal to 10 + her shifter level, and she can use her breath weapon three times per day.</p>
			<p>This replaces shifter aspect and all improvements to shifter aspect.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>A shifter can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 93). The shifter rolls 1d20 and adds her shifter level and Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild empathy, the shifter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another and under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
			<p>The shifter can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>
			<p><b>Defensive Instinct (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, when unarmored, not using a shield, unencumbered, and conscious, the shifter adds her Wisdom bonus (if any) to her AC and CMD. If she is wearing nonmetal armor or using a nonmetal shield, she instead adds half her Wisdom bonus to her AC (minimum 0). In addition, the shifter gains a +1 bonus to her AC and CMD at 4th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 shifter levels thereafter (up to a maximum of +5 at 20th level).</p>
			<p>These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks and when the shifter is flatfooted. She loses these bonuses when she is immobilized or helpless. These bonuses do not stack with the monk AC bonus class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Track (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a shifter adds half her level as a bonus on Survival checks to follow tracks.</p>
			<p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a shifter can move through any sort of undergrowth (such as briars, natural thorns, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Briars, thorns, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion still affect the shifter.</p>
			<p><b>Wild Shape (Su): </b>At 4th level, a shifter gains the ability to turn herself into the major form of one of her aspects and back again. This ability functions as beast shape II, except as noted here. The shifter can turn into the major form of only one of her aspects at a time. Using wild shape to change to a major form or back is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke attacks of opportunity. Often a particular aspect&#146;s major form grants abilities beyond the normal effect of beast shape II. Each major form details the abilities the shifter gains with that major form and at what level; she gains these instead of the form abilities from beast shape II, but she still gains beast shape II abilities that are size dependent.</p>
			<p>A shifter loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal of that form can make, but she can communicate with other animals of the same general grouping as her form. She can also communicate in nonverbal ways with allies.</p>
			<p>A shifter can use wild shape for a number of hours each day equal to her shifter level + her Wisdom modifier. It need not be consecutive but must be spent in 1 hour increments. For abilities that function based on &#145;uses of wild shape,&#146; each hour of wild shape counts as a use.</p>
			<p>A shifters can take feats and other abilities that require wild shape; for the purpose of qualifying for prerequisites, her effective druid level is equal to her shifter level.</p>
			<p><b>Trackless Step (Ex) </b>: At 5th level, a shifter leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She can choose to leave a trail if she so desires.</p>
			<p><b>Shifter&#146;s Fury (Ex): </b>At level 6, a shifter gains the ability to make several ferocious attacks with the same natural weapon. Instead of attacking with all her natural weapons, the shifter can choose a single natural weapon and make a full attack with that natural weapon, gaining a second iterative attack at a &#150;5 as if it was a manufactured weapon. When she does so, all her other natural attacks count as secondary attacks and don&#146;t benefit from shifter&#146;s claws. At 11th level, she gains a third iterative attack at a &#150;10 and at 16th level, she gains a fourth iterative attack at &#150;15.</p>
			<p><b>Wyrmshifter (Su): </b>At 9th level, a dragonblood shifter can push her form closer to that of a true dragon. She gains a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against sleep and paralysis effects. She does not gain the wild shape ability until 9th level. When using the ability, she takes on the form of a true dragon; this ability functions as form of the dragon I instead of beast shape II. A dragonblood shifter can use wild shape for a number of minutes each day equal to her shifter level + her Wisdom modifier. This duration doesn&#146;t need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. For abilities that function based on uses of wild shape, each minute of wild shape counts as a use.</p>
			<p>This alters wild shape and replaces chimeric aspect.</p>
			<p><b>Improved Wyrmshifter (Su): </b>At 14th level, a dragonblood shifter&#146;s ties to her draconic abilities grow stronger. Her bonus on saves against sleep and paralysis effects increases to +4. Her wild shape ability now functions as form of the dragon II, and she can use it for a number of minutes each day equal to twice her shifter level + her Wisdom modifier, though it still must be used in 1-minute increments.</p>
			<p>This replaces greater chimeric aspect.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su): </b>At 18th level, a shifter gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the alter self spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 18th level, a shifter no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the shifter still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>
			<p><b>Greater Wyrmshifter (Su): </b>At 20th level, a dragonblood shifter&#146;s tie to her draconic abilities reaches its peak. She becomes immune to sleep and paralysis effects. She can use wild shape to transform into a dragon for a number of hours each day equal to her shifter level + her Wisdom modifier. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-hour increments. For abilities that function based on uses of wild shape, each hour of wild shape counts as a use.</p>
			<p>This replaces final aspect.</p>
			<h>Speaking Druidic</h>
			<p>For the purposes of teaching and learning the Druidic language, shifters are considered to be druids&#151;the nuances of the language are instrumental in teaching characters of both classes to use and control their abilities. While the rare druidic circle might bar shifters from its order, and while some eccentric shifters may view druids as competitors or even enemies, all shifters are assumed to speak it.</p>
			<h>Ex-Shifters</h>
			<p>A shifter who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a non-druid or a non-shifter loses all her supernatural abilities. She cannot thereafter gain levels as a shifter until she atones (see the atonement spell description on page 245 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<h>Alternate Natural Attacks</h>
			<p>A shifter can draw on her chosen animal aspect to transform her hands into deadly weapons, as represented by the shifter&#146;s claws class feature, but not every animal has prominent claws. The following list provides alternate natural attacks for the shifter claws class feature. Each time the shifter activates her shifter&#146;s claws ability in her natural form, she can manifest one of the alternate natural attacks listed below for any of her chosen aspects, or those that relate to her archetype. Each alternate natural attack replaces one of the shifter&#146;s claw attacks. The shifter can gain up to two different alternate natural attacks with this method. These alternate natural attacks modify only the damage type of the shifter&#146;s natural attacks and otherwise function exactly as the shifter claws class feature.</p>

					<p>At will, a shifter in her natural form can extend her claws as a swift action to use as a weapon. This magical transformation is fueled as much by the shifter&#146;s faith in the natural world as it is by inborn talent. The claws on each hand can be used as a primary natural attack, dealing 1d4 points of piercing and slashing damage (1d3 if she is Small). If she uses one of her claw attacks in concert with a weapon held in the other hand, the claw acts as a secondary natural attack instead.</p>
					<p>As the shifter gains levels, the power of her claws increases. At 3rd level, her claws ignore DR/cold iron, DR/magic, and DR/silver. At 7th level, her claw damage increases to 1d6 (1d4 if Small). At 11th level, her claw damage increases to 1d8 (1d6 if Small). At 13th level, her claw damage increases to 1d10 (1d8 if Small). At 17th level, the damage die does not increase, but the critical multiplier becomes &#215;3. Lastly, at 19th level, the claws ignore DR/adamantine and DR/&#151;.</p>
					<p>While a shifter uses wild shape to assume her aspect&#146;s major form, her natural attacks gain the same benefits granted by her shifter claws ability. If the form she takes has claw attacks, she can use either the base damage of her shifter claws or the damage of the form&#146;s claws, whichever is greater. If the form does not have claw attacks, she can choose up to two natural attacks that would deal less damage than her shifter claw damage and have those attacks instead deal the same damage as her shifter claws.</p>

				<name type="string">Wild Empathy</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>A shifter can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 93). The shifter rolls 1d20 and adds her shifter level and Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild empathy, the shifter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another and under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>
					<p>The shifter can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a &#150;4 penalty on the check.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>At 4th level, a shifter gains the ability to turn herself into the major form of one of her aspects and back again. This ability functions as beast shape II, except as noted here. The shifter can turn into the major form of only one of her aspects at a time. Using wild shape to change to a major form or back is a standard action that doesn&#146;t provoke attacks of opportunity. Often a particular aspect&#146;s major form grants abilities beyond the normal effect of beast shape II. Each major form details the abilities the shifter gains with that major form and at what level; she gains these instead of the form abilities from beast shape II, but she still gains beast shape II abilities that are size dependent.</p>
					<p>A shifter loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal of that form can make, but she can communicate with other animals of the same general grouping as her form. She can also communicate in nonverbal ways with allies.</p>
					<p>A shifter can use wild shape for a number of hours each day equal to her shifter level + her Wisdom modifier. It need not be consecutive but must be spent in 1 hour increments. For abilities that function based on &#145;uses of wild shape,&#146; each hour of wild shape counts as a use.</p>
					<p>A shifters can take feats and other abilities that require wild shape; for the purpose of qualifying for prerequisites, her effective druid level is equal to her shifter level.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Rather than emulate other animals entirely, some shifters learn to reshape their forms on the fly in response to a range of stimuli, rarely taking on a new form for longer than necessary to overcome a challenge.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Whether riding on the wind as a falcon or hiding in some fetid bog waiting to strike, the shifter is a true master of the wild. Both a devoted defender of druidic circles and a fierce predator, the shifter can take on the forms of nature and even fuse them together with devastating effect and unbridled savagery. By way of the druidic discipline of wild shape, they become living aspects of the wild. At first, they are able to assume only a minor aspect, but with time and practice they can fully transform into ever more powerful forms.</p>
			<p>The shifter class offers players a way to experience a shapeshifting character that is more martially inclined than a spellcasting druid. With each new level, the shifter&#146;s powers grow in new and surprising ways, creating a character that thrives in battle, exploration, and stealth.</p>
			<p>Shifters are protectors of druidic circles and avengers of nature, yet a shifter&#146;s magic is different from that of her druidic kin. Rather than invoking spells from the natural world or forging alliances with animals, shifters focus their supernatural powers inward to gain control over their own forms. Their ability to change their forms is as varied as the wonders of the wilds themselves but always remains at least partially rooted in the natural world. There are many paths to becoming a shifter; most are trained in that role by druidic circles and have their powers unlocked via rituals of initiation. Yet some stumble upon the gift naturally, as if their blood bore the secrets of shifter transformation.</p>
			<p>For those leaning toward the causes of law and good, the path of the shifter is one of contemplation and understanding. They become one with nature through mental and physical mimicry and gain an ever deeper spiritual understanding of the ebb and flow of the natural world. Those leaning toward the chaotic and evil teachings of druidic philosophy find such enlightenment through more violent means. These are typically quicker transformations, both brutal and painful, imparting the dark lessons of nature through its most catastrophic forms. Shifters who lean toward true neutrality are the most diverse when it comes to their command of metamorphic secrets.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>The shifter is so attuned to nature and the wild beasts of the world that she can call upon those powers to mystically fortify her being. Fluid in form and function, she can shape herself to overcome hardships and support those she befriends or serves.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any neutral.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
			<p>S <b>tarting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Shifter's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A shifter is proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. She is also proficient with the natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) from the shifter claws class feature and of forms she assumes with wild shape.</p>
			<p>Shifters are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor. A shifter can wear wooden armor that has been altered by the ironwood spell so that it functions as if it were steel. Shifters are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A shifter who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to use her shifter aspect, shifter claws, wild shape, and other shifter supernatural or spell-like abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Adaptive Claws (Su): </b>When activating her shifter claws ability in her natural form, an adaptive shifter can instead manifest a single bite attack that deals bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage; a gore attack that deals piercing damage; or a tail slap that deals bludgeoning damage. This natural attack otherwise deals damage as the shifter&#146;s claws.</p>
			<p>This alters shifter claws.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Languages: </b>A shifter&#146;s bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures, and Aklo, the tongue spoken by certain sinister fey or otherworldly denizens of reaches of the wild rarely explored by humanity. These choices are in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>
			<p>A shifter speaks Druidic, a secret language known only to druids and shifters, which she learns upon becoming a 1stlevel shifter. Druidic is a free language for a shifter; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages, and it doesn&#146;t take up a language slot. Shifters are forbidden to teach this language to non-druids or non-shifters.</p>
			<p><b>Reactive Aspect (Su): </b>An adaptive shifter gains the ability to change parts of her body to avoid harm, gain a physical advantage, or overcome an obstacle. She can do so a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Wisdom modifier + her shifter level. By activating this ability, either as an immediate action or as a swift action, an adaptive shifter gains the benefits of one of her reactive forms until the beginning of her next turn (see below). An adaptive shifter can assume only one reactive form at a time. Activating a new reactive form (or forms) ends all reactive forms currently manifested.</p>
			<p>At 9th level, an adaptive shifter gains the benefits of up to two reactive forms whenever she uses this ability. At 14th level, she can assume up to three forms. At 20th level, she learns all reactive forms and doubles her effective Wisdom modifier for the purpose of calculating her uses of reactive aspect per day.</p>
			<p>This replaces shifter aspect, chimeric aspect, greater chimeric aspect, and final aspect.</p>
			<p><b>Shifter Claws (Su): </b>At will, a shifter in her natural form can extend her claws as a swift action to use as a weapon. This magical transformation is fueled as much by the shifter&#146;s faith in the natural world as it is by inborn talent. The claws on each hand can be used as a primary natural attack, dealing 1d4 points of piercing and slashing damage (1d3 if she is Small). If she uses one of her claw attacks in concert with a weapon held in the other hand, the claw acts as a secondary natural attack instead.</p>
			<p>As the shifter gains levels, the power of her claws increases. At 3rd level, her claws ignore DR/cold iron, DR/magic, and DR/silver. At 7th level, her claw damage increases to 1d6 (1d4 if Small). At 11th level, her claw damage increases to 1d8 (1d6 if Small). At 13th level, her claw damage increases to 1d10 (1d8 if Small). At 17th level, the damage die does not increase, but the critical multiplier becomes &#215;3. Lastly, at 19th level, the claws ignore DR/adamantine and DR/&#151;.</p>
			<p>While a shifter uses wild shape to assume her aspect&#146;s major form, her natural attacks gain the same benefits granted by her shifter claws ability. If the form she takes has claw attacks, she can use either the base damage of her shifter claws or the damage of the form&#146;s claws, whichever is greater. If the form does not have claw attacks, she can choose up to two natural attacks that would deal less damage than her shifter claw damage and have those attacks instead deal the same damage as her shifter claws.</p>
			<p><b>Defensive Instinct (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, when unarmored, not using a shield, unencumbered, and conscious, the shifter adds her Wisdom bonus (if any) to her AC and CMD. If she is wearing nonmetal armor or using a nonmetal shield, she instead adds half her Wisdom bonus to her AC (minimum 0). In addition, the shifter gains a +1 bonus to her AC and CMD at 4th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 shifter levels thereafter (up to a maximum of +5 at 20th level).</p>
			<p>These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks and when the shifter is flatfooted. She loses these bonuses when she is immobilized or helpless. These bonuses do not stack with the monk AC bonus class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Reactive Form (Su): </b>An adaptive shifter learns two reactive forms from the list below. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an adaptive shifter learns an additional reactive form. Forms marked with an asterisk (*) are lasting forms. An adaptive shifter can spend two uses of reactive aspect to increase a lasting form&#146;s duration to 1 minute. Forms not marked with an asterisk always last only until the beginning of her next turn.</p>
			<p><b>Lasting Adaptation (Su): </b>At 5th level, an adaptive shifter can spend 1 minute willing her body to adapt in a more enduring way. At the end of the minute, she expends two uses of her reactive aspect and selects one lasting form she knows. She assumes this form and can maintain it until she regains her daily uses of reactive aspect or uses this ability again. This adaptation does not count against the maximum number of forms she can assume at once. She can select a form that has a minimum level only if her character level is at least 3 higher than the minimum level.</p>
			<p>At 15th level, the adaptive shifter can maintain up to two lasting adaptations simultaneously, spending an additional minute and two uses of her reactive aspect each time she assumes a new adaptation.</p>
			<p>This replaces wild empathy, track, woodland stride, and trackless step</p>
			<p><b>Shifter&#146;s Fury (Ex): </b>At level 6, a shifter gains the ability to make several ferocious attacks with the same natural weapon. Instead of attacking with all her natural weapons, the shifter can choose a single natural weapon and make a full attack with that natural weapon, gaining a second iterative attack at a &#150;5 as if it was a manufactured weapon. When she does so, all her other natural attacks count as secondary attacks and don&#146;t benefit from shifter&#146;s claws. At 11th level, she gains a third iterative attack at a &#150;10 and at 16th level, she gains a fourth iterative attack at &#150;15.</p>
			<p><b>Unfettered Wild Shape (Su): </b>At 6th level, an adaptive shifter gains the ability to turn into other creatures. This functions as a druid&#146;s wild shape ability, except she does not gain the ability to turn into an elemental. The shifter&#146;s effective druid level is equal to her class level. She can use this ability for a number of hours per day equal to half her effective druid level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-hour increments. For abilities that function based on &#147;uses of wild shape,&#148; each hour of unfettered wild shape counts as a use.</p>
			<p>This replaces wild shape.</p>
			<p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su): </b>At 18th level, a shifter gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the alter self spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>
			<p><b>Timeless Body (Ex) </b>: After attaining 18th level, a shifter no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the shifter still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>
			<h>Speaking Druidic</h>
			<p>For the purposes of teaching and learning the Druidic language, shifters are considered to be druids&#151;the nuances of the language are instrumental in teaching characters of both classes to use and control their abilities. While the rare druidic circle might bar shifters from its order, and while some eccentric shifters may view druids as competitors or even enemies, all shifters are assumed to speak it.</p>
			<h>Ex-Shifters</h>
			<p>A shifter who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a non-druid or a non-shifter loses all her supernatural abilities. She cannot thereafter gain levels as a shifter until she atones (see the atonement spell description on page 245 of the Core Rulebook).</p>
			<h>Alternate Natural Attacks</h>
			<p>A shifter can draw on her chosen animal aspect to transform her hands into deadly weapons, as represented by the shifter&#146;s claws class feature, but not every animal has prominent claws. The following list provides alternate natural attacks for the shifter claws class feature. Each time the shifter activates her shifter&#146;s claws ability in her natural form, she can manifest one of the alternate natural attacks listed below for any of her chosen aspects, or those that relate to her archetype. Each alternate natural attack replaces one of the shifter&#146;s claw attacks. The shifter can gain up to two different alternate natural attacks with this method. These alternate natural attacks modify only the damage type of the shifter&#146;s natural attacks and otherwise function exactly as the shifter claws class feature.</p>
