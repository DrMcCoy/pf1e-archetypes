						<text type="formattedtext">
							<p>Bloodragers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A bloodrager can cast bloodrager spells while wearing light armor or medium armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a bloodrager wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>

						<text type="formattedtext">
							<p>At 11th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +3. In addition, upon entering a bloodrage, the bloodrager can apply the effects a bloodrager spell he knows of 2nd level or lower to himself. The spell must have a range of touch or personal. If the spell&#146;s duration is greater than 1 round, it instead lasts for the duration of the bloodrage. This use consumes a bloodrager spell slot, as if he had cast the spell; he must have the spell slot available to take advantage of this effect.</p>

						<text type="formattedtext">
							<p>At 7th level, a bloodrager gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the bloodrager takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every 3 levels thereafter, this damage reduction increases by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0.</p>

						<name type="string">Improved Uncanny Dodge</name>
						<text type="formattedtext">
							<p>At 5th level, a bloodrager can no longer be flanked. This defense denies rogues (or other classes with the sneak attack ability) the ability to sneak attack the bloodrager by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels (or levels in the class granting sneak attack) than the target has bloodrager levels.</p>
							<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack when determining the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>

						<text type="formattedtext">
							<p>Beginning at 4th level, a bloodrager gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells drawn from the bloodrager spell list. To learn or cast a spell, a bloodrager must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. He can cast spells he knows without preparing them ahead of time. The saving throw DC against a bloodrager&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the bloodrager&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
							<p>Like other spellcasters, a bloodrager can cast only a certain number of spells of each level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;3. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (Table 1-3: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). The bloodrager does not need to prepare these spells in advance; he can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he hasn&#146;t yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
							<p>The bloodrager&#146;s selection of spells is limited. At 4th level, a bloodrager knows two 1st-level spells of his choice. A bloodrager gains more spells as he increases in level, as indicated on Table 1&#150;4. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bloodrager knows is not affected by his Charisma score, but it is affected by any bonus spells he gains from his bloodline. At 8th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. This swap follows all the same rules as for a sorcerer.</p>

						<text type="formattedtext">
							<p>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains the ability to cast spells even while bloodraging. He can also cast these spells defensively and can make concentration checks for these spells while bloodraging. While bloodraging, he can cast and concentrate on only his bloodrager spells (see below); spells from other classes cannot be cast during this state.</p>

						<name type="string">Uncanny Dodge</name>
						<text type="formattedtext">
							<p>At 2nd level, a bloodrager can react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A bloodrager with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
							<p>If a bloodrager already possesses uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>

							<p>At 3rd level, due to the power of his blood, a bloodrager can stand confidently amid the effects of spells cast by himself or his allies. He gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells that he or an ally casts.</p>

							<p>A bloodrager&#146;s land speed is faster than is normal for his race by 10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the bloodrager&#146;s speed due to any armor worn or load carried. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the bloodrager&#146;s land speed.</p>

						<text type="formattedtext">
							<p>The bloodrager&#146;s source of internal power grants him the ability to bloodrage. At 1st level, a bloodrager can bloodrage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, he can bloodrage for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution (such as those gained from bloodraging or spells like bear&#146;s endurance) don&#146;t increase the total number of rounds that a bloodrager can bloodrage per day. The total number of rounds of bloodrage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours need not be consecutive.</p>
							<p>A bloodrager can enter a bloodrage as a free action. While in a bloodrage, a bloodrager gains a +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, he takes a &#150;2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the bloodrager 2 hit points per Hit Die, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While bloodraging, a bloodrager cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
							<p>A bloodrager can end his bloodrage as a free action. When the bloodrage ends, he&#146;s fatigued for a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent in the bloodrage. A bloodrager cannot enter a new bloodrage while fatigued or exhausted, but can otherwise enter bloodrage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a bloodrager falls unconscious, his bloodrage immediately ends, placing him in peril of death.</p>
							<p>Bloodrage counts as the barbarian&#146;s rage class feature for the purpose of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>

						<name type="string">Bloodline</name>
						<text type="formattedtext">
							<p>Each bloodrager has a source of magic somewhere in his heritage that empowers his bloodrages, bonus feats, and bonus spells. Sometimes this source reflects a distant blood relationship to a powerful being, or is due to an extreme event involving such a creature somewhere in his family&#146;s past. Regardless of the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways. A bloodrager must pick one bloodline upon taking his first level of bloodrager. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
							<p>When choosing a bloodline, the bloodrager&#146;s alignment doesn&#146;t restrict his choices. A good bloodrager could come from an abyssal bloodline, a celestial bloodline could beget an evil bloodrager generations later, a bloodrager from an infernal bloodline could be chaotic, and so on. Though his bloodline empowers him, it doesn&#146;t dictate or limit his thoughts and behavior.</p>
							<p>The bloodrager gains bloodline powers at 1st level, 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter. The bloodline powers a bloodrager gains are described in his chosen bloodline. For all spell-like bloodline powers, treat the character&#146;s bloodrager level as the caster level.</p>
							<p>At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager receives one bonus feat chosen from a list specific to each bloodline. The bloodrager must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats.</p>
							<p>At 7th, 10th, 13th, and 16th levels, a bloodrager learns an additional spell derived from his bloodline. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 1&#150;4. These spells cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
							<p>If the bloodrager takes levels in another class that grants a bloodline, the bloodlines must be the same type, even if that means that the bloodline of one of the classes must change. Subject to GM discretion, the bloodrager can change his former bloodline to make them conform.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>-</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>While many ferocious combatants can tap into a deep reservoir of buried rage, bloodragers have an intrinsic power that seethes within. Like sorcerers, bloodragers&#146; veins surge with arcane power. While sorcerers use this power for spellcasting, bloodragers enter an altered state in which their bloodline becomes manifest, where the echoes of their strange ancestry lash out with devastating power. In these states, bloodragers can cast some arcane spells instinctively. The bloodrager&#146;s magic is as fast, violent, and seemingly unstoppable as their physical prowess.</p>
					<p><b>Role: </b>Masters of the battlefield, bloodragers unleash fearful carnage on their enemies using their bloodlines and combat prowess. The bloodrager&#146;s place is on the front lines, right in his enemies&#146; faces, supplying tremendous martial force bolstered by a trace of arcane magic.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
					<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
					<p><b>Parent Class(es) </b>: Barbarian and sorcerer.</p>
					<p><b>Starting Wealth </b>: 3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
					<h>Class Skills</h>
					<p>The Bloodrager's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Perception (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
					<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Bloodragers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A bloodrager can cast bloodrager spells while wearing light armor or medium armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a bloodrager wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
					<p><b>Bloodline: </b>Each bloodrager has a source of magic somewhere in his heritage that empowers his bloodrages, bonus feats, and bonus spells. Sometimes this source reflects a distant blood relationship to a powerful being, or is due to an extreme event involving such a creature somewhere in his family&#146;s past. Regardless of the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways. A bloodrager must pick one bloodline upon taking his first level of bloodrager. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
					<p>When choosing a bloodline, the bloodrager&#146;s alignment doesn&#146;t restrict his choices. A good bloodrager could come from an abyssal bloodline, a celestial bloodline could beget an evil bloodrager generations later, a bloodrager from an infernal bloodline could be chaotic, and so on. Though his bloodline empowers him, it doesn&#146;t dictate or limit his thoughts and behavior.</p>
					<p>The bloodrager gains bloodline powers at 1st level, 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter. The bloodline powers a bloodrager gains are described in his chosen bloodline. For all spell-like bloodline powers, treat the character&#146;s bloodrager level as the caster level.</p>
					<p>At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager receives one bonus feat chosen from a list specific to each bloodline. The bloodrager must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats.</p>
					<p>At 7th, 10th, 13th, and 16th levels, a bloodrager learns an additional spell derived from his bloodline. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 1&#150;4. These spells cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
					<p>If the bloodrager takes levels in another class that grants a bloodline, the bloodlines must be the same type, even if that means that the bloodline of one of the classes must change. Subject to GM discretion, the bloodrager can change his former bloodline to make them conform.</p>
					<p><b>Bloodrage (Su): </b>The bloodrager&#146;s source of internal power grants him the ability to bloodrage. At 1st level, a bloodrager can bloodrage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, he can bloodrage for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution (such as those gained from bloodraging or spells like bear&#146;s endurance) don&#146;t increase the total number of rounds that a bloodrager can bloodrage per day. The total number of rounds of bloodrage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours need not be consecutive.</p>
					<p>A bloodrager can enter a bloodrage as a free action. While in a bloodrage, a bloodrager gains a +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, he takes a &#150;2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the bloodrager 2 hit points per Hit Die, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While bloodraging, a bloodrager cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A bloodrager can end his bloodrage as a free action. When the bloodrage ends, he&#146;s fatigued for a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent in the bloodrage. A bloodrager cannot enter a new bloodrage while fatigued or exhausted, but can otherwise enter bloodrage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a bloodrager falls unconscious, his bloodrage immediately ends, placing him in peril of death.</p>
					<p>Bloodrage counts as the barbarian&#146;s rage class feature for the purpose of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>
					<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex): </b>A bloodrager&#146;s land speed is faster than is normal for his race by 10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the bloodrager&#146;s speed due to any armor worn or load carried. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the bloodrager&#146;s land speed.</p>
					<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 2nd level, a bloodrager can react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A bloodrager with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
					<p>If a bloodrager already possesses uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
					<p><b>Blood Sanctuary (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, due to the power of his blood, a bloodrager can stand confidently amid the effects of spells cast by himself or his allies. He gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells that he or an ally casts.</p>
					<p><b>Blood Casting (Su): </b>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains the ability to cast spells even while bloodraging. He can also cast these spells defensively and can make concentration checks for these spells while bloodraging. While bloodraging, he can cast and concentrate on only his bloodrager spells (see below); spells from other classes cannot be cast during this state.</p>
					<p><b>Eschew Materials: </b>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains Eschew Materials as a bonus feat.</p>
					<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a bloodrager gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells drawn from the bloodrager spell list. To learn or cast a spell, a bloodrager must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. He can cast spells he knows without preparing them ahead of time. The saving throw DC against a bloodrager&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the bloodrager&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a bloodrager can cast only a certain number of spells of each level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;3. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (Table 1-3: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). The bloodrager does not need to prepare these spells in advance; he can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he hasn&#146;t yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
					<p>The bloodrager&#146;s selection of spells is limited. At 4th level, a bloodrager knows two 1st-level spells of his choice. A bloodrager gains more spells as he increases in level, as indicated on Table 1&#150;4. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bloodrager knows is not affected by his Charisma score, but it is affected by any bonus spells he gains from his bloodline. At 8th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. This swap follows all the same rules as for a sorcerer.</p>
					<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a bloodrager can no longer be flanked. This defense denies rogues (or other classes with the sneak attack ability) the ability to sneak attack the bloodrager by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels (or levels in the class granting sneak attack) than the target has bloodrager levels.</p>
					<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack when determining the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a bloodrager gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the bloodrager takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every 3 levels thereafter, this damage reduction increases by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 11th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +3. In addition, upon entering a bloodrage, the bloodrager can apply the effects a bloodrager spell he knows of 2nd level or lower to himself. The spell must have a range of touch or personal. If the spell&#146;s duration is greater than 1 round, it instead lasts for the duration of the bloodrage. This use consumes a bloodrager spell slot, as if he had cast the spell; he must have the spell slot available to take advantage of this effect.</p>
					<p>Greater bloodrage counts as the barbarian&#146;s greater rage ability for the purposes of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a bloodrager gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells while bloodraging. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves he also receives during his bloodrage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 17th level, a bloodrager no longer becomes fatigued at the end of his bloodrage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 20th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +8, and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +4. Furthermore, the spell he can apply to himself at the beginning of a bloodrage due to the greater bloodrage class feature is not limited to only spells of 2nd level or lower.</p>

At 10th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the urban bloodrager can add another such spell to her spell list and spells known.

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>Like the urban barbarian (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 31), the urban bloodrager has learned to control her rage in so-called polite society. Though she lacks the untamed resilience of her wilder fellows, she&#146;s an expert at keeping her rage from causing collateral damage in crowds.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>While many ferocious combatants can tap into a deep reservoir of buried rage, bloodragers have an intrinsic power that seethes within. Like sorcerers, bloodragers&#146; veins surge with arcane power. While sorcerers use this power for spellcasting, bloodragers enter an altered state in which their bloodline becomes manifest, where the echoes of their strange ancestry lash out with devastating power. In these states, bloodragers can cast some arcane spells instinctively. The bloodrager&#146;s magic is as fast, violent, and seemingly unstoppable as their physical prowess.</p>
					<p><b>Role: </b>Masters of the battlefield, bloodragers unleash fearful carnage on their enemies using their bloodlines and combat prowess. The bloodrager&#146;s place is on the front lines, right in his enemies&#146; faces, supplying tremendous martial force bolstered by a trace of arcane magic.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
					<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
					<p><b>Parent Class(es) </b>: Barbarian and sorcerer.</p>
					<p><b>Starting Wealth </b>: 3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
					<h>Class Skills</h>
					<p>The Bloodrager's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Diplomacy (Cha), Craft (Int), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), and Swim (Str).</p>
					<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Bloodragers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, and medium armor. A bloodrager can cast bloodrager spells while wearing light armor or medium armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a bloodrager wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
					<p>An urban bloodrager isn&#146;t proficient with shields. This alters the bloodrager&#146;s weapon and armor proficiencies.</p>
					<p><b>Bloodline: </b>Each bloodrager has a source of magic somewhere in his heritage that empowers his bloodrages, bonus feats, and bonus spells. Sometimes this source reflects a distant blood relationship to a powerful being, or is due to an extreme event involving such a creature somewhere in his family&#146;s past. Regardless of the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways. A bloodrager must pick one bloodline upon taking his first level of bloodrager. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
					<p>When choosing a bloodline, the bloodrager&#146;s alignment doesn&#146;t restrict his choices. A good bloodrager could come from an abyssal bloodline, a celestial bloodline could beget an evil bloodrager generations later, a bloodrager from an infernal bloodline could be chaotic, and so on. Though his bloodline empowers him, it doesn&#146;t dictate or limit his thoughts and behavior.</p>
					<p>The bloodrager gains bloodline powers at 1st level, 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter. The bloodline powers a bloodrager gains are described in his chosen bloodline. For all spell-like bloodline powers, treat the character&#146;s bloodrager level as the caster level.</p>
					<p>At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager receives one bonus feat chosen from a list specific to each bloodline. The bloodrager must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats.</p>
					<p>At 7th, 10th, 13th, and 16th levels, a bloodrager learns an additional spell derived from his bloodline. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 1&#150;4. These spells cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
					<p>If the bloodrager takes levels in another class that grants a bloodline, the bloodlines must be the same type, even if that means that the bloodline of one of the classes must change. Subject to GM discretion, the bloodrager can change his former bloodline to make them conform.</p>
					<p><b>Controlled Bloodrage: </b>When an urban bloodrager rages, she does not gain the normal benefits. Instead, she can apply a +4 morale bonus to her Constitution, Dexterity, or Strength. This bonus increases to +6 when she gains greater bloodrage and to +8 when she gains mighty bloodrage. She can apply the full bonus to one ability score or split the bonus between several scores in increments of 2. When using a controlled bloodrage, an urban bloodrager gains no bonus on Will saves, takes no penalties to AC, and can still use Charisma-, Dexterity-, and Intelligence-based skills. A controlled bloodrage still counts as a bloodrage for the purposes of any spells, feats, and other effects. This ability alters bloodrage.</p>
					<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex): </b>A bloodrager&#146;s land speed is faster than is normal for his race by 10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the bloodrager&#146;s speed due to any armor worn or load carried. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the bloodrager&#146;s land speed.</p>
					<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 2nd level, a bloodrager can react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A bloodrager with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
					<p>If a bloodrager already possesses uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
					<p><b>Restrained Magic (Su): </b>At 3rd level, an urban bloodrager can attune her spells so they are less likely to impact her allies or innocent bystanders. When the bloodrager casts a spell, she can grant a +2 bonus on the saving throw against that spell to any creatures she is aware of that are targeted by the spell or within the spell&#146;s area. Any creature that receives this bonus and succeeds at its save is unaffected by the spell, as if it hadn&#146;t been targeted or wasn&#146;t in the area. This ability replaces blood sanctuary.</p>
					<p><b>Blood Casting (Su): </b>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains the ability to cast spells even while bloodraging. He can also cast these spells defensively and can make concentration checks for these spells while bloodraging. While bloodraging, he can cast and concentrate on only his bloodrager spells (see below); spells from other classes cannot be cast during this state.</p>
					<p><b>Eschew Materials: </b>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains Eschew Materials as a bonus feat.</p>
					<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a bloodrager gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells drawn from the bloodrager spell list. To learn or cast a spell, a bloodrager must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. He can cast spells he knows without preparing them ahead of time. The saving throw DC against a bloodrager&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the bloodrager&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a bloodrager can cast only a certain number of spells of each level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;3. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (Table 1-3: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). The bloodrager does not need to prepare these spells in advance; he can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he hasn&#146;t yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
					<p>The bloodrager&#146;s selection of spells is limited. At 4th level, a bloodrager knows two 1st-level spells of his choice. A bloodrager gains more spells as he increases in level, as indicated on Table 1&#150;4. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bloodrager knows is not affected by his Charisma score, but it is affected by any bonus spells he gains from his bloodline. At 8th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. This swap follows all the same rules as for a sorcerer.</p>
					<p>I <b>mproved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a bloodrager can no longer be flanked. This defense denies rogues (or other classes with the sneak attack ability) the ability to sneak attack the bloodrager by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels (or levels in the class granting sneak attack) than the target has bloodrager levels.</p>
					<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack when determining the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
					<p><b>Adopted Magic: </b>At 7th level, an urban bloodrager learns some of the secrets of other magical traditions from other denizens of the city. She can select from the bard or magus spell list any spell of a level she can cast, and add it to her bloodrager spell list and to her bloodrager spells known. At 10th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the urban bloodrager can add another such spell to her spell list and spells known. If she chooses to learn a new spell in place of an old one, she can exchange a bard or magus spell for another. This ability replaces damage reduction.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 11th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +3. In addition, upon entering a bloodrage, the bloodrager can apply the effects a bloodrager spell he knows of 2nd level or lower to himself. The spell must have a range of touch or personal. If the spell&#146;s duration is greater than 1 round, it instead lasts for the duration of the bloodrage. This use consumes a bloodrager spell slot, as if he had cast the spell; he must have the spell slot available to take advantage of this effect.</p>
					<p>Greater bloodrage counts as the barbarian&#146;s greater rage ability for the purposes of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a bloodrager gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells while bloodraging. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves he also receives during his bloodrage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 17th level, a bloodrager no longer becomes fatigued at the end of his bloodrage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 20th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +8, and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +4. Furthermore, the spell he can apply to himself at the beginning of a bloodrage due to the greater bloodrage class feature is not limited to only spells of 2nd level or lower.</p>

A bloodrager with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>

							<p>The bloodrager&#146;s source of internal power grants him the ability to bloodrage. At 1st level, a bloodrager can bloodrage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, he can bloodrage for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution (such as those gained from bloodraging or spells like bear&#146;s endurance) don&#146;t increase the total number of rounds that a bloodrager can bloodrage per day. The total number of rounds of bloodrage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours need not be consecutive.</p>
							<p>A bloodrager can enter a bloodrage as a free action. While in a bloodrage, a bloodrager gains a +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, he takes a &#150;2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the bloodrager 2 hit points per Hit Die, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While bloodraging, a bloodrager cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
							<p>A bloodrager can end his bloodrage as a free action. When the bloodrage ends, he&#146;s fatigued for a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent in the bloodrage. A bloodrager cannot enter a new bloodrage while fatigued or exhausted, but can otherwise enter bloodrage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a bloodrager falls unconscious, his bloodrage immediately ends, placing him in peril of death.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>While most bloodragers are known for their inexplicable ability to focus their bloodline into a horrifying mix of martial terror and spellcasting fury, from time to time a bloodrager&#146;s bloodline acts differently. Instead of empowering the bloodrager, it shields the bloodrager from magic of all types, often keeping the bloodrager untouched within the midst of magical effects.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>While many ferocious combatants can tap into a deep reservoir of buried rage, bloodragers have an intrinsic power that seethes within. Like sorcerers, bloodragers&#146; veins surge with arcane power. While sorcerers use this power for spellcasting, bloodragers enter an altered state in which their bloodline becomes manifest, where the echoes of their strange ancestry lash out with devastating power. In these states, bloodragers can cast some arcane spells instinctively. The bloodrager&#146;s magic is as fast, violent, and seemingly unstoppable as their physical prowess.</p>
					<p><b>Role: </b>Masters of the battlefield, bloodragers unleash fearful carnage on their enemies using their bloodlines and combat prowess. The bloodrager&#146;s place is on the front lines, right in his enemies&#146; faces, supplying tremendous martial force bolstered by a trace of arcane magic.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
					<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
					<p><b>Parent Class(es) </b>: Barbarian and sorcerer.</p>
					<p><b>Starting Wealth </b>: 3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
					<h>Class Skills</h>
					<p>The Bloodrager's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Perception (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
					<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Bloodragers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A bloodrager can cast bloodrager spells while wearing light armor or medium armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a bloodrager wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
					<p><b>Bloodline: </b>Each bloodrager has a source of magic somewhere in his heritage that empowers his bloodrages, bonus feats, and bonus spells. Sometimes this source reflects a distant blood relationship to a powerful being, or is due to an extreme event involving such a creature somewhere in his family&#146;s past. Regardless of the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways. A bloodrager must pick one bloodline upon taking his first level of bloodrager. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
					<p>When choosing a bloodline, the bloodrager&#146;s alignment doesn&#146;t restrict his choices. A good bloodrager could come from an abyssal bloodline, a celestial bloodline could beget an evil bloodrager generations later, a bloodrager from an infernal bloodline could be chaotic, and so on. Though his bloodline empowers him, it doesn&#146;t dictate or limit his thoughts and behavior.</p>
					<p>The bloodrager gains bloodline powers at 1st level, 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter. The bloodline powers a bloodrager gains are described in his chosen bloodline. For all spell-like bloodline powers, treat the character&#146;s bloodrager level as the caster level.</p>
					<p>At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager receives one bonus feat chosen from a list specific to each bloodline. The bloodrager must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats.</p>
					<p>If the bloodrager takes levels in another class that grants a bloodline, the bloodlines must be the same type, even if that means that the bloodline of one of the classes must change. Subject to GM discretion, the bloodrager can change his former bloodline to make them conform.</p>
					<p><b>Bloodrage (Su): </b>The bloodrager&#146;s source of internal power grants him the ability to bloodrage. At 1st level, a bloodrager can bloodrage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, he can bloodrage for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution (such as those gained from bloodraging or spells like bear&#146;s endurance) don&#146;t increase the total number of rounds that a bloodrager can bloodrage per day. The total number of rounds of bloodrage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours need not be consecutive.</p>
					<p>A bloodrager can enter a bloodrage as a free action. While in a bloodrage, a bloodrager gains a +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, he takes a &#150;2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the bloodrager 2 hit points per Hit Die, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While bloodraging, a bloodrager cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A bloodrager can end his bloodrage as a free action. When the bloodrage ends, he&#146;s fatigued for a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent in the bloodrage. A bloodrager cannot enter a new bloodrage while fatigued or exhausted, but can otherwise enter bloodrage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a bloodrager falls unconscious, his bloodrage immediately ends, placing him in peril of death.</p>
					<p>Bloodrage counts as the barbarian&#146;s rage class feature for the purpose of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>
					<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex): </b>A bloodrager&#146;s land speed is faster than is normal for his race by 10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the bloodrager&#146;s speed due to any armor worn or load carried. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the bloodrager&#146;s land speed.</p>
					<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 2nd level, a bloodrager can react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A bloodrager with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
					<p>If a bloodrager already possesses uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
					<p><b>Blood Sanctuary (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, due to the power of his blood, a bloodrager can stand confidently amid the effects of spells cast by himself or his allies. He gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells that he or an ally casts.</p>
					<p><b>Raging Resistance (Ex): </b>At 4th level, instead of gaining spells, a bloodrager becomes resistant to spells. While bloodraging, he gains spell resistance equal to 8 + his bloodrager level. Unlike normal spell resistance, the untouchable rager&#146;s spell resistance cannot be voluntarily lowered. As long as the untouchable is bloodraging, the spell resistance is persistent, and can only be lowered by ending the bloodrage. At 7th, 10th, 13th, and 16th levels (when other bloodragers would gain bloodline spells), an untouchable rager&#146;s spell resistance from raging resistance is increased by 1. This ability replaces the spells, blood casting, eschew materials, and bloodline spells class features.</p>
					<p>I <b>mproved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a bloodrager can no longer be flanked. This defense denies rogues (or other classes with the sneak attack ability) the ability to sneak attack the bloodrager by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels (or levels in the class granting sneak attack) than the target has bloodrager levels.</p>
					<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack when determining the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a bloodrager gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the bloodrager takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every 3 levels thereafter, this damage reduction increases by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 11th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +3. In addition, upon entering a bloodrage, the bloodrager can apply the effects a bloodrager spell he knows of 2nd level or lower to himself. The spell must have a range of touch or personal. If the spell&#146;s duration is greater than 1 round, it instead lasts for the duration of the bloodrage. This use consumes a bloodrager spell slot, as if he had cast the spell; he must have the spell slot available to take advantage of this effect.</p>
					<p>Greater bloodrage counts as the barbarian&#146;s greater rage ability for the purposes of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a bloodrager gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells while bloodraging. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves he also receives during his bloodrage.</p>
					<p><b>Resistance Control (Ex): </b>At 14th level, an untouchable rager gains the spell resistance from raging resistance even while not in a bloodrage. Additionally, as long as the untouchable rager isn&#146;t bloodraging, he can turn off this spell resistance.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 17th level, a bloodrager no longer becomes fatigued at the end of his bloodrage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 20th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +8, and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +4. Furthermore, the spell he can apply to himself at the beginning of a bloodrage due to the greater bloodrage class feature is not limited to only spells of 2nd level or lower.</p>

							<p>Beginning at 4th level, a bloodrager gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells drawn from the bloodrager spell list. To learn or cast a spell, a bloodrager must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. He can cast spells he knows without preparing them ahead of time. The saving throw DC against a bloodrager&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the bloodrager&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
							<p>Like other spellcasters, a bloodrager can cast only a certain number of spells of each level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;3. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (Table 1-3: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). The bloodrager does not need to prepare these spells in advance; he can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he hasn&#146;t yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
							<p>The bloodrager&#146;s selection of spells is limited. At 4th level, a bloodrager knows two 1st-level spells of his choice. A bloodrager gains more spells as he increases in level, as indicated on Table 1&#150;4. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bloodrager knows is not affected by his Charisma score, but it is affected by any bonus spells he gains from his bloodline. At 8th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. This swap follows all the same rules as for a sorcerer.</p>

							<p>Each bloodrager has a source of magic somewhere in his heritage that empowers his bloodrages, bonus feats, and bonus spells. Sometimes this source reflects a distant blood relationship to a powerful being, or is due to an extreme event involving such a creature somewhere in his family&#146;s past. Regardless of the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways. A bloodrager must pick one bloodline upon taking his first level of bloodrager. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
							<p>When choosing a bloodline, the bloodrager&#146;s alignment doesn&#146;t restrict his choices. A good bloodrager could come from an abyssal bloodline, a celestial bloodline could beget an evil bloodrager generations later, a bloodrager from an infernal bloodline could be chaotic, and so on. Though his bloodline empowers him, it doesn&#146;t dictate or limit his thoughts and behavior.</p>
							<p>The bloodrager gains bloodline powers at 1st level, 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter. The bloodline powers a bloodrager gains are described in his chosen bloodline. For all spell-like bloodline powers, treat the character&#146;s bloodrager level as the caster level.</p>

							<p>At 7th, 10th, 13th, and 16th levels, a bloodrager learns an additional spell derived from his bloodline. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 1&#150;4. These spells cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
							<p>If the bloodrager takes levels in another class that grants a bloodline, the bloodlines must be the same type, even if that means that the bloodline of one of the classes must change. Subject to GM discretion, the bloodrager can change his former bloodline to make them conform.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>Symbol strikers are honored warriors of Dongun Hold, a Sky Citadel in Alkenstar that was a site of frequent conflicts between the nations of Geb and Nex. The dwarven inhabitants used powerful magic explosives to seal the fortress against the outside world and prevent the Sky Citadel from becoming a pawn in the arcane wars between the two powers. Only with the arrival of Ancil Alkenstar in 4588 AR did Dongun Hold reopen itself to the outside world. By then, the constant exposure to strange runic energies and the long isolation had caused a unique form of rune-wielding berserker spellcaster to develop, though the symbol striker tradition has since spread beyond its origins.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>While many ferocious combatants can tap into a deep reservoir of buried rage, bloodragers have an intrinsic power that seethes within. Like sorcerers, bloodragers&#146; veins surge with arcane power. While sorcerers use this power for spellcasting, bloodragers enter an altered state in which their bloodline becomes manifest, where the echoes of their strange ancestry lash out with devastating power. In these states, bloodragers can cast some arcane spells instinctively. The bloodrager&#146;s magic is as fast, violent, and seemingly unstoppable as their physical prowess.</p>
					<p><b>Role: </b>Masters of the battlefield, bloodragers unleash fearful carnage on their enemies using their bloodlines and combat prowess. The bloodrager&#146;s place is on the front lines, right in his enemies&#146; faces, supplying tremendous martial force bolstered by a trace of arcane magic.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
					<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
					<p><b>Parent Class(es) </b>: Barbarian and sorcerer.</p>
					<p><b>Starting Wealth </b>: 3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
					<h>Class Skills</h>
					<p>The Bloodrager's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
					<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Bloodragers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A bloodrager can cast bloodrager spells while wearing light armor or medium armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a bloodrager wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
					<p><b>Bloodline: </b>Each bloodrager has a source of magic somewhere in his heritage that empowers his bloodrages, bonus feats, and bonus spells. Sometimes this source reflects a distant blood relationship to a powerful being, or is due to an extreme event involving such a creature somewhere in his family&#146;s past. Regardless of the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways. A bloodrager must pick one bloodline upon taking his first level of bloodrager. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
					<p>When choosing a bloodline, the bloodrager&#146;s alignment doesn&#146;t restrict his choices. A good bloodrager could come from an abyssal bloodline, a celestial bloodline could beget an evil bloodrager generations later, a bloodrager from an infernal bloodline could be chaotic, and so on. Though his bloodline empowers him, it doesn&#146;t dictate or limit his thoughts and behavior.</p>
					<p>The bloodrager gains bloodline powers at 1st level, 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter. The bloodline powers a bloodrager gains are described in his chosen bloodline. For all spell-like bloodline powers, treat the character&#146;s bloodrager level as the caster level.</p>
					<p>At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager receives one bonus feat chosen from a list specific to each bloodline. The bloodrager must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats.</p>
					<p>At 7th, 10th, 13th, and 16th levels, a bloodrager learns an additional spell derived from his bloodline. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 1&#150;4. These spells cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
					<p>If the bloodrager takes levels in another class that grants a bloodline, the bloodlines must be the same type, even if that means that the bloodline of one of the classes must change. Subject to GM discretion, the bloodrager can change his former bloodline to make them conform.</p>
					<p><b>Bloodrage (Su): </b>The bloodrager&#146;s source of internal power grants him the ability to bloodrage. At 1st level, a bloodrager can bloodrage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, he can bloodrage for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution (such as those gained from bloodraging or spells like bear&#146;s endurance) don&#146;t increase the total number of rounds that a bloodrager can bloodrage per day. The total number of rounds of bloodrage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours need not be consecutive.</p>
					<p>A bloodrager can enter a bloodrage as a free action. While in a bloodrage, a bloodrager gains a +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, he takes a &#150;2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the bloodrager 2 hit points per Hit Die, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While bloodraging, a bloodrager cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A bloodrager can end his bloodrage as a free action. When the bloodrage ends, he&#146;s fatigued for a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent in the bloodrage. A bloodrager cannot enter a new bloodrage while fatigued or exhausted, but can otherwise enter bloodrage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a bloodrager falls unconscious, his bloodrage immediately ends, placing him in peril of death.</p>
					<p>Bloodrage counts as the barbarian&#146;s rage class feature for the purpose of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>
					<p><b>Rune Training (Sp): </b>A symbol striker can cast read magic at will and comprehend languages once per day, but only to decipher written text. A symbol striker also adds arcane mark and erase to his bloodrager spell list as 1st-level spells, though he must select these as spells known to be able to cast them.</p>
					<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 2nd level, a bloodrager can react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A bloodrager with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
					<p>If a bloodrager already possesses uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
					<p><b>Blood Sanctuary (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, due to the power of his blood, a bloodrager can stand confidently amid the effects of spells cast by himself or his allies. He gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells that he or an ally casts.</p>
					<p><b>Blood Casting (Su): </b>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains the ability to cast spells even while bloodraging. He can also cast these spells defensively and can make concentration checks for these spells while bloodraging. While bloodraging, he can cast and concentrate on only his bloodrager spells (see below); spells from other classes cannot be cast during this state.</p>
					<p><b>Eschew Materials: </b>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains Eschew Materials as a bonus feat.</p>
					<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a bloodrager gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells drawn from the bloodrager spell list. To learn or cast a spell, a bloodrager must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. He can cast spells he knows without preparing them ahead of time. The saving throw DC against a bloodrager&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the bloodrager&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a bloodrager can cast only a certain number of spells of each level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;3. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (Table 1-3: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). The bloodrager does not need to prepare these spells in advance; he can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he hasn&#146;t yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
					<p>The bloodrager&#146;s selection of spells is limited. At 4th level, a bloodrager knows two 1st-level spells of his choice. A bloodrager gains more spells as he increases in level, as indicated on Table 1&#150;4. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bloodrager knows is not affected by his Charisma score, but it is affected by any bonus spells he gains from his bloodline. At 8th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. This swap follows all the same rules as for a sorcerer.</p>
					<p>I <b>mproved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a bloodrager can no longer be flanked. This defense denies rogues (or other classes with the sneak attack ability) the ability to sneak attack the bloodrager by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels (or levels in the class granting sneak attack) than the target has bloodrager levels.</p>
					<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack when determining the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
					<p><b>Weapon Rune (Su): </b>At 6th level, once per day as a standard action, a symbol striker can imbue any spell he knows that has a range of touch or greater and a defined number of targets (rather than an area or other non-target- based effect) into a melee weapon he is holding. The spell forms itself into a brightly glowing rune, which is obvious to a casual observer. This ability functions only while the symbol striker wields the weapon. If dropped or taken, the weapon ceases granting this ability until it is returned to the symbol striker. The symbol striker can have only a single weapon rune active at a time; if he casts an additional weapon rune while a previous rune is active, the earlier rune fades. Weapon runes also fade when the symbol striker regains his spell slots for the day. Otherwise, the rune remains until the spell is discharged or dispelled. At 12th level, a symbol striker can use this ability twice per day. At 18th level, he can use this ability three times per day.</p>
					<p>As a standard action, the symbol striker can make a melee attack with a weapon that has an active weapon rune and, if the attack is successful, deal normal weapon damage and also expend the weapon rune to discharge the stored spell into the target, as if delivering the spell with the magus spellstrike class feature.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a bloodrager gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the bloodrager takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every 3 levels thereafter, this damage reduction increases by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Rune Trap (Sp): </b>At 9th level, as a standard action, the symbol striker can use a melee weapon to place a rune trap in any adjacent square. Any creature entering a square containing a rune trap takes 1d6 points of damage plus 1 additional point of damage for every 2 bloodrager levels the symbol striker has. This rune deals either acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, which is decided at the rune&#146;s creation. The rune is clearly visible and lasts a number of minutes equal to the symbol striker&#146;s bloodrager level or until discharged. A symbol striker cannot create a rune trap in a square occupied by another creature. This rune counts as a 1st-level spell for the purpose of dispelling. A creature can disarm the rune by succeeding at a DC 26 Disable Device check. The symbol striker can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 plus his Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 11th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +3. In addition, upon entering a bloodrage, the bloodrager can apply the effects a bloodrager spell he knows of 2nd level or lower to himself. The spell must have a range of touch or personal. If the spell&#146;s duration is greater than 1 round, it instead lasts for the duration of the bloodrage. This use consumes a bloodrager spell slot, as if he had cast the spell; he must have the spell slot available to take advantage of this effect.</p>
					<p>Greater bloodrage counts as the barbarian&#146;s greater rage ability for the purposes of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a bloodrager gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells while bloodraging. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves he also receives during his bloodrage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 17th level, a bloodrager no longer becomes fatigued at the end of his bloodrage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 20th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +8, and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +4. Furthermore, the spell he can apply to himself at the beginning of a bloodrage due to the greater bloodrage class feature is not limited to only spells of 2nd level or lower.</p>

							<p>The bloodrager&#146;s selection of spells is limited. At 4th level, a bloodrager knows two 1st-level spells of his choice. A bloodrager gains more spells as he increases in level, as indicated on Table 1&#150;4. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bloodrager knows is not affected by his Charisma score, but it is affected by any bonus spells he gains from his bloodline. At 8th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. This swap follows all the same rules as for a sorcerer.</p>

							<p>The bloodrager&#146;s source of internal power grants him the ability to bloodrage. At 1st level, a bloodrager can bloodrage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, he can bloodrage for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution (such as those gained from bloodraging or spells like bear&#146;s endurance) don&#146;t increase the total number of rounds that a bloodrager can bloodrage per day. The total number of rounds of bloodrage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours need not be consecutive.</p>
							<p>A bloodrager can enter a bloodrage as a free action. While in a bloodrage, a bloodrager gains a +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, he takes a &#150;2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the bloodrager 2 hit points per Hit Die, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While bloodraging, a bloodrager cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
							<p>A bloodrager can end his bloodrage as a free action. When the bloodrage ends, he&#146;s fatigued for a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent in the bloodrage. A bloodrager cannot enter a new bloodrage while fatigued or exhausted, but can otherwise enter bloodrage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a bloodrager falls unconscious, his bloodrage immediately ends, placing him in peril of death.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>Most bloodragers prefer light armor, but some learn the secret of using heavy armors. These steelbloods plod around the battlefield inspiring fear and delivering carnage from within a steel shell.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>While many ferocious combatants can tap into a deep reservoir of buried rage, bloodragers have an intrinsic power that seethes within. Like sorcerers, bloodragers&#146; veins surge with arcane power. While sorcerers use this power for spellcasting, bloodragers enter an altered state in which their bloodline becomes manifest, where the echoes of their strange ancestry lash out with devastating power. In these states, bloodragers can cast some arcane spells instinctively. The bloodrager&#146;s magic is as fast, violent, and seemingly unstoppable as their physical prowess.</p>
					<p><b>Role: </b>Masters of the battlefield, bloodragers unleash fearful carnage on their enemies using their bloodlines and combat prowess. The bloodrager&#146;s place is on the front lines, right in his enemies&#146; faces, supplying tremendous martial force bolstered by a trace of arcane magic.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
					<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
					<p><b>Parent Class(es) </b>: Barbarian and sorcerer.</p>
					<p><b>Starting Wealth </b>: 3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
					<h>Class Skills</h>
					<p>The Bloodrager's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Perception (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
					<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Bloodragers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A bloodrager can cast bloodrager spells while wearing light armor or medium armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a bloodrager wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
					<p>A steelblood gains proficiency in heavy armor. A steelblood can cast bloodrager spells while wearing heavy armor without incurring an arcane spell failure chance. This replaces the bloodrager&#146;s armor proficiency.</p>

					<p><b>Bloodrage (Su): </b>The bloodrager&#146;s source of internal power grants him the ability to bloodrage. At 1st level, a bloodrager can bloodrage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, he can bloodrage for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution (such as those gained from bloodraging or spells like bear&#146;s endurance) don&#146;t increase the total number of rounds that a bloodrager can bloodrage per day. The total number of rounds of bloodrage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours need not be consecutive.</p>
					<p>A bloodrager can enter a bloodrage as a free action. While in a bloodrage, a bloodrager gains a +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, he takes a &#150;2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the bloodrager 2 hit points per Hit Die, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While bloodraging, a bloodrager cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A bloodrager can end his bloodrage as a free action. When the bloodrage ends, he&#146;s fatigued for a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent in the bloodrage. A bloodrager cannot enter a new bloodrage while fatigued or exhausted, but can otherwise enter bloodrage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a bloodrager falls unconscious, his bloodrage immediately ends, placing him in peril of death.</p>
					<p>Bloodrage counts as the barbarian&#146;s rage class feature for the purpose of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Stance (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a steelblood gains a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks, to CMD against overrun combat maneuvers, and on Reflex saving throws against trample attacks. He also gains a +1 bonus to his AC against charge attacks and on attack and damage rolls against charging creatures. This ability replaces fast movement.</p>
					<p><b>Armored Swiftness (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a steelblood moves faster in medium and heavy armor. When wearing medium or heavy armor, a steelblood can move 5 feet faster than normal in that armor, to a maximum of his unencumbered speed. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.</p>
					<p><b>Blood Sanctuary (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, due to the power of his blood, a bloodrager can stand confidently amid the effects of spells cast by himself or his allies. He gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells that he or an ally casts.</p>
					<p><b>Blood Casting (Su): </b>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains the ability to cast spells even while bloodraging. He can also cast these spells defensively and can make concentration checks for these spells while bloodraging. While bloodraging, he can cast and concentrate on only his bloodrager spells (see below); spells from other classes cannot be cast during this state.</p>
					<p><b>Eschew Materials: </b>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains Eschew Materials as a bonus feat.</p>
					<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a bloodrager gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells drawn from the bloodrager spell list. To learn or cast a spell, a bloodrager must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. He can cast spells he knows without preparing them ahead of time. The saving throw DC against a bloodrager&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the bloodrager&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a bloodrager can cast only a certain number of spells of each level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;3. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (Table 1-3: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). The bloodrager does not need to prepare these spells in advance; he can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he hasn&#146;t yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
					<p>The bloodrager&#146;s selection of spells is limited. At 4th level, a bloodrager knows two 1st-level spells of his choice. A bloodrager gains more spells as he increases in level, as indicated on Table 1&#150;4. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bloodrager knows is not affected by his Charisma score, but it is affected by any bonus spells he gains from his bloodline. At 8th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. This swap follows all the same rules as for a sorcerer.</p>
					<p><b>Armor Training (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a steelblood learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a maximum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every 4 levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), these bonuses increase by 1, to a maximum 4-point reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus. This ability stacks with the fighter class feature of the same name. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
					<p><b>Blood Deflection (Su): </b>At 7th level, as an immediate action a steelblood can sacrifice a bloodrager spell slot to gain a deflection bonus to AC equal to the level of the spell sacrificed. The deflection bonus lasts until the start of his next turn. This ability can be applied after an attack roll is made against the steelblood, allowing the steelblood to convert a hit into a miss if the deflection bonus is high enough. This ability replaces damage reduction.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 11th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +3. In addition, upon entering a bloodrage, the bloodrager can apply the effects a bloodrager spell he knows of 2nd level or lower to himself. The spell must have a range of touch or personal. If the spell&#146;s duration is greater than 1 round, it instead lasts for the duration of the bloodrage. This use consumes a bloodrager spell slot, as if he had cast the spell; he must have the spell slot available to take advantage of this effect.</p>
					<p>Greater bloodrage counts as the barbarian&#146;s greater rage ability for the purposes of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a bloodrager gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells while bloodraging. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves he also receives during his bloodrage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 17th level, a bloodrager no longer becomes fatigued at the end of his bloodrage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 20th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +8, and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +4. Furthermore, the spell he can apply to himself at the beginning of a bloodrage due to the greater bloodrage class feature is not limited to only spells of 2nd level or lower.</p>

							<p>Each bloodrager has a source of magic somewhere in his heritage that empowers his bloodrages, bonus feats, and bonus spells. Sometimes this source reflects a distant blood relationship to a powerful being, or is due to an extreme event involving such a creature somewhere in his family&#146;s past. Regardless of the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways. A bloodrager must pick one bloodline upon taking his first level of bloodrager. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
							<p>When choosing a bloodline, the bloodrager&#146;s alignment doesn&#146;t restrict his choices. A good bloodrager could come from an abyssal bloodline, a celestial bloodline could beget an evil bloodrager generations later, a bloodrager from an infernal bloodline could be chaotic, and so on. Though his bloodline empowers him, it doesn&#146;t dictate or limit his thoughts and behavior.</p>
							<p>The bloodrager gains bloodline powers at 1st level, 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter. The bloodline powers a bloodrager gains are described in his chosen bloodline. For all spell-like bloodline powers, treat the character&#146;s bloodrager level as the caster level.</p>
							<p>At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager receives one bonus feat chosen from a list specific to each bloodline. The bloodrager must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats.</p>

							<p>If the bloodrager takes levels in another class that grants a bloodline, the bloodlines must be the same type, even if that means that the bloodline of one of the classes must change. Subject to GM discretion, the bloodrager can change his former bloodline to make them conform.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>Where other bloodragers learn to avoid or shrug off minor damage of all sorts, spelleaters tap into the power of their bloodline in order to heal damage as it comes, and can even cannibalize their own magical energy to heal more damage and continue taking the fight to the enemy.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>While many ferocious combatants can tap into a deep reservoir of buried rage, bloodragers have an intrinsic power that seethes within. Like sorcerers, bloodragers&#146; veins surge with arcane power. While sorcerers use this power for spellcasting, bloodragers enter an altered state in which their bloodline becomes manifest, where the echoes of their strange ancestry lash out with devastating power. In these states, bloodragers can cast some arcane spells instinctively. The bloodrager&#146;s magic is as fast, violent, and seemingly unstoppable as their physical prowess.</p>
					<p><b>Role: </b>Masters of the battlefield, bloodragers unleash fearful carnage on their enemies using their bloodlines and combat prowess. The bloodrager&#146;s place is on the front lines, right in his enemies&#146; faces, supplying tremendous martial force bolstered by a trace of arcane magic.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
					<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
					<p><b>Parent Class(es) </b>: Barbarian and sorcerer.</p>
					<p><b>Starting Wealth </b>: 3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
					<h>Class Skills</h>
					<p>The Bloodrager's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Perception (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
					<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Bloodragers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A bloodrager can cast bloodrager spells while wearing light armor or medium armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a bloodrager wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
					<p><b>Bloodline: </b>Each bloodrager has a source of magic somewhere in his heritage that empowers his bloodrages, bonus feats, and bonus spells. Sometimes this source reflects a distant blood relationship to a powerful being, or is due to an extreme event involving such a creature somewhere in his family&#146;s past. Regardless of the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways. A bloodrager must pick one bloodline upon taking his first level of bloodrager. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
					<p>When choosing a bloodline, the bloodrager&#146;s alignment doesn&#146;t restrict his choices. A good bloodrager could come from an abyssal bloodline, a celestial bloodline could beget an evil bloodrager generations later, a bloodrager from an infernal bloodline could be chaotic, and so on. Though his bloodline empowers him, it doesn&#146;t dictate or limit his thoughts and behavior.</p>
					<p>The bloodrager gains bloodline powers at 1st level, 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter. The bloodline powers a bloodrager gains are described in his chosen bloodline. For all spell-like bloodline powers, treat the character&#146;s bloodrager level as the caster level.</p>
					<p>At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager receives one bonus feat chosen from a list specific to each bloodline. The bloodrager must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats.</p>
					<p>At 7th, 10th, 13th, and 16th levels, a bloodrager learns an additional spell derived from his bloodline. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 1&#150;4. These spells cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
					<p>If the bloodrager takes levels in another class that grants a bloodline, the bloodlines must be the same type, even if that means that the bloodline of one of the classes must change. Subject to GM discretion, the bloodrager can change his former bloodline to make them conform.</p>
					<p><b>Bloodrage (Su): </b>The bloodrager&#146;s source of internal power grants him the ability to bloodrage. At 1st level, a bloodrager can bloodrage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, he can bloodrage for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution (such as those gained from bloodraging or spells like bear&#146;s endurance) don&#146;t increase the total number of rounds that a bloodrager can bloodrage per day. The total number of rounds of bloodrage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours need not be consecutive.</p>
					<p>A bloodrager can enter a bloodrage as a free action. While in a bloodrage, a bloodrager gains a +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, he takes a &#150;2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the bloodrager 2 hit points per Hit Die, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While bloodraging, a bloodrager cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A bloodrager can end his bloodrage as a free action. When the bloodrage ends, he&#146;s fatigued for a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent in the bloodrage. A bloodrager cannot enter a new bloodrage while fatigued or exhausted, but can otherwise enter bloodrage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a bloodrager falls unconscious, his bloodrage immediately ends, placing him in peril of death.</p>
					<p>Bloodrage counts as the barbarian&#146;s rage class feature for the purpose of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>
					<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex): </b>A bloodrager&#146;s land speed is faster than is normal for his race by 10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the bloodrager&#146;s speed due to any armor worn or load carried. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the bloodrager&#146;s land speed.</p>
					<p><b>Blood of Life (Su): </b>A spelleater&#146;s blood empowers him to slowly recover from his wounds. At 2nd level, while bloodraging a spelleater gains fast healing 1 (Bestiary 300). At 7th level and every 3 levels thereafter, this increases by 1 (to a maximum of fast healing 6 at 19th level). If the spelleater gains an increase to damage reduction from a bloodline, feat, or other ability, he is considered to have an effective damage reduction of 0, and the increase is added to this effective damage reduction. This ability replaces uncanny dodge and damage reduction.</p>
					<p><b>Blood Sanctuary (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, due to the power of his blood, a bloodrager can stand confidently amid the effects of spells cast by himself or his allies. He gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells that he or an ally casts.</p>
					<p><b>Blood Casting (Su): </b>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains the ability to cast spells even while bloodraging. He can also cast these spells defensively and can make concentration checks for these spells while bloodraging. While bloodraging, he can cast and concentrate on only his bloodrager spells (see below); spells from other classes cannot be cast during this state.</p>
					<p><b>Eschew Materials: </b>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains Eschew Materials as a bonus feat.</p>
					<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a bloodrager gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells drawn from the bloodrager spell list. To learn or cast a spell, a bloodrager must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. He can cast spells he knows without preparing them ahead of time. The saving throw DC against a bloodrager&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the bloodrager&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a bloodrager can cast only a certain number of spells of each level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;3. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (Table 1-3: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). The bloodrager does not need to prepare these spells in advance; he can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he hasn&#146;t yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
					<p>The bloodrager&#146;s selection of spells is limited. At 4th level, a bloodrager knows two 1st-level spells of his choice. A bloodrager gains more spells as he increases in level, as indicated on Table 1&#150;4. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bloodrager knows is not affected by his Charisma score, but it is affected by any bonus spells he gains from his bloodline. At 8th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. This swap follows all the same rules as for a sorcerer.</p>
					<p><b>Spell Eating (Su): </b>At 5th level, a spelleater can consume spell slots for an extra dose of healing. As a swift action, the spelleater can consume one unused bloodrager spell slot to heal 1d8 damage for each level of the spell slot consumed. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge..</p>
					<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack when determining the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 11th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +3. In addition, upon entering a bloodrage, the bloodrager can apply the effects a bloodrager spell he knows of 2nd level or lower to himself. The spell must have a range of touch or personal. If the spell&#146;s duration is greater than 1 round, it instead lasts for the duration of the bloodrage. This use consumes a bloodrager spell slot, as if he had cast the spell; he must have the spell slot available to take advantage of this effect.</p>
					<p>Greater bloodrage counts as the barbarian&#146;s greater rage ability for the purposes of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a bloodrager gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells while bloodraging. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves he also receives during his bloodrage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 17th level, a bloodrager no longer becomes fatigued at the end of his bloodrage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 20th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +8, and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +4. Furthermore, the spell he can apply to himself at the beginning of a bloodrage due to the greater bloodrage class feature is not limited to only spells of 2nd level or lower.</p>

The rageshaper must succeed at a concentration check as if casting defensively to modify the spell; otherwise, the spell is wasted. If he succeeds, the spell is treated as if the rageshaper had the Extend Spell metamagic feat. The rageshaper must be the spell&#146;s intended target or cast a spell with a range of personal to gain this effect. If the rageshaper casts a spell that is linked to the rageshaper&#146;s own bloodline, such as a rageshaper with the elemental bloodline who casts elemental body I, the spell is automatically extended without forcing the concentration check, so long as the rageshaper casts it while in a bloodrage.

							<p>The bloodrager&#146;s source of internal power grants him the ability to bloodrage. At 1st level, a bloodrager can bloodrage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, he can bloodrage for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution (such as those gained from bloodraging or spells like bear&#146;s endurance) don&#146;t increase the total number of rounds that a bloodrager can bloodrage per day. The total number of rounds of bloodrage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours need not be consecutive.</p>
							<p>A bloodrager can enter a bloodrage as a free action. While in a bloodrage, a bloodrager gains a +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, he takes a &#150;2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the bloodrager 2 hit points per Hit Die, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While bloodraging, a bloodrager cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
							<p>A bloodrager can end his bloodrage as a free action. When the bloodrage ends, he&#146;s fatigued for a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent in the bloodrage. A bloodrager cannot enter a new bloodrage while fatigued or exhausted, but can otherwise enter bloodrage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a bloodrager falls unconscious, his bloodrage immediately ends, placing him in peril of death.</p>
							<p>Bloodrage counts as the barbarian&#146;s rage class feature for the purpose of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>

							<p>Each bloodrager has a source of magic somewhere in his heritage that empowers his bloodrages, bonus feats, and bonus spells. Sometimes this source reflects a distant blood relationship to a powerful being, or is due to an extreme event involving such a creature somewhere in his family&#146;s past. Regardless of the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways. A bloodrager must pick one bloodline upon taking his first level of bloodrager. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
							<p>When choosing a bloodline, the bloodrager&#146;s alignment doesn&#146;t restrict his choices. A good bloodrager could come from an abyssal bloodline, a celestial bloodline could beget an evil bloodrager generations later, a bloodrager from an infernal bloodline could be chaotic, and so on. Though his bloodline empowers him, it doesn&#146;t dictate or limit his thoughts and behavior.</p>
							<p>The bloodrager gains bloodline powers at 1st level, 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter. The bloodline powers a bloodrager gains are described in his chosen bloodline. For all spell-like bloodline powers, treat the character&#146;s bloodrager level as the caster level.</p>
							<p>At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager receives one bonus feat chosen from a list specific to each bloodline. The bloodrager must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats.</p>
							<p>At 7th, 10th, 13th, and 16th levels, a bloodrager learns an additional spell derived from his bloodline. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 1&#150;4. These spells cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
							<p>If the bloodrager takes levels in another class that grants a bloodline, the bloodlines must be the same type, even if that means that the bloodline of one of the classes must change. Subject to GM discretion, the bloodrager can change his former bloodline to make them conform.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>All bloodragers blend the unpredictable surge of arcane power with the savage fury of battle lust. For most, their rage is a conduit for the eldritch power locked in their heritage, but for a rageshaper, the latent magical energies in his blood bring about physical transformations and facilitate the blending of arcana and aggression into a deadly synthesis that few other barbarians (or even other bloodragers) can match.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>While many ferocious combatants can tap into a deep reservoir of buried rage, bloodragers have an intrinsic power that seethes within. Like sorcerers, bloodragers&#146; veins surge with arcane power. While sorcerers use this power for spellcasting, bloodragers enter an altered state in which their bloodline becomes manifest, where the echoes of their strange ancestry lash out with devastating power. In these states, bloodragers can cast some arcane spells instinctively. The bloodrager&#146;s magic is as fast, violent, and seemingly unstoppable as their physical prowess.</p>
					<p><b>Role: </b>Masters of the battlefield, bloodragers unleash fearful carnage on their enemies using their bloodlines and combat prowess. The bloodrager&#146;s place is on the front lines, right in his enemies&#146; faces, supplying tremendous martial force bolstered by a trace of arcane magic.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
					<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
					<p><b>Parent Class(es) </b>: Barbarian and sorcerer.</p>
					<p><b>Starting Wealth </b>: 3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
					<h>Class Skills</h>
					<p>The Bloodrager's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Perception (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
					<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Bloodragers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A bloodrager can cast bloodrager spells while wearing light armor or medium armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a bloodrager wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
					<p><b>Bloodline: </b>Each bloodrager has a source of magic somewhere in his heritage that empowers his bloodrages, bonus feats, and bonus spells. Sometimes this source reflects a distant blood relationship to a powerful being, or is due to an extreme event involving such a creature somewhere in his family&#146;s past. Regardless of the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways. A bloodrager must pick one bloodline upon taking his first level of bloodrager. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
					<p>When choosing a bloodline, the bloodrager&#146;s alignment doesn&#146;t restrict his choices. A good bloodrager could come from an abyssal bloodline, a celestial bloodline could beget an evil bloodrager generations later, a bloodrager from an infernal bloodline could be chaotic, and so on. Though his bloodline empowers him, it doesn&#146;t dictate or limit his thoughts and behavior.</p>
					<p>The bloodrager gains bloodline powers at 1st level, 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter. The bloodline powers a bloodrager gains are described in his chosen bloodline. For all spell-like bloodline powers, treat the character&#146;s bloodrager level as the caster level.</p>
					<p>At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager receives one bonus feat chosen from a list specific to each bloodline. The bloodrager must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats.</p>
					<p>At 7th, 10th, 13th, and 16th levels, a bloodrager learns an additional spell derived from his bloodline. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 1&#150;4. These spells cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
					<p>If the bloodrager takes levels in another class that grants a bloodline, the bloodlines must be the same type, even if that means that the bloodline of one of the classes must change. Subject to GM discretion, the bloodrager can change his former bloodline to make them conform.</p>
					<p><b>Bloodrage (Su): </b>The bloodrager&#146;s source of internal power grants him the ability to bloodrage. At 1st level, a bloodrager can bloodrage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, he can bloodrage for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution (such as those gained from bloodraging or spells like bear&#146;s endurance) don&#146;t increase the total number of rounds that a bloodrager can bloodrage per day. The total number of rounds of bloodrage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours need not be consecutive.</p>
					<p>A bloodrager can enter a bloodrage as a free action. While in a bloodrage, a bloodrager gains a +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, he takes a &#150;2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the bloodrager 2 hit points per Hit Die, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While bloodraging, a bloodrager cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A bloodrager can end his bloodrage as a free action. When the bloodrage ends, he&#146;s fatigued for a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent in the bloodrage. A bloodrager cannot enter a new bloodrage while fatigued or exhausted, but can otherwise enter bloodrage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a bloodrager falls unconscious, his bloodrage immediately ends, placing him in peril of death.</p>
					<p>Bloodrage counts as the barbarian&#146;s rage class feature for the purpose of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>
					<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex): </b>A bloodrager&#146;s land speed is faster than is normal for his race by 10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the bloodrager&#146;s speed due to any armor worn or load carried. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the bloodrager&#146;s land speed.</p>
					<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 2nd level, a bloodrager can react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A bloodrager with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
					<p>If a bloodrager already possesses uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
					<p><b>Bestial Aspect (Su): </b>At 4th level, whenever a rageshaper gains a natural attack through the use of a polymorph spell, he can increase the damage done by that attack by one die. If the spell grants multiple natural attacks, the rageshaper must choose one kind of natural attack for the ability to enhance. At 9th level, if the rageshaper&#146;s altered form grants him a new mode of movement, that movement&#146;s base speed increases by 10 feet. This is an enhancement bonus. If the rageshaper&#146;s bloodrage powers already grant natural attacks or alternate modes of movement, then the bonuses granted by bestial aspect also apply to these bloodrage powers. This ability replaces blood sanctuary.</p>
					<p><b>Blood Casting (Su): </b>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains the ability to cast spells even while bloodraging. He can also cast these spells defensively and can make concentration checks for these spells while bloodraging. While bloodraging, he can cast and concentrate on only his bloodrager spells (see below); spells from other classes cannot be cast during this state.</p>
					<p><b>Eschew Materials: </b>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains Eschew Materials as a bonus feat.</p>
					<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a bloodrager gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells drawn from the bloodrager spell list. To learn or cast a spell, a bloodrager must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. He can cast spells he knows without preparing them ahead of time. The saving throw DC against a bloodrager&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the bloodrager&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a bloodrager can cast only a certain number of spells of each level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;3. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (Table 1-3: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). The bloodrager does not need to prepare these spells in advance; he can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he hasn&#146;t yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
					<p>The bloodrager&#146;s selection of spells is limited. At 4th level, a bloodrager knows two 1st-level spells of his choice. A bloodrager gains more spells as he increases in level, as indicated on Table 1&#150;4. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bloodrager knows is not affected by his Charisma score, but it is affected by any bonus spells he gains from his bloodline. At 8th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. This swap follows all the same rules as for a sorcerer.</p>
					<p><b>Furious Transformation (Su): </b>At 5th level, a rageshaper can attempt to bolster any transmutation spell from the bloodrager spell list with the polymorph subschool while bloodraging. The rageshaper must succeed at a concentration check as if casting defensively to modify the spell; otherwise, the spell is wasted. If he succeeds, the spell is treated as if the rageshaper had the Extend Spell metamagic feat. The rageshaper must be the spell&#146;s intended target or cast a spell with a range of personal to gain this effect. If the rageshaper casts a spell that is linked to the rageshaper&#146;s own bloodline, such as a rageshaper with the elemental bloodline who casts elemental body I, the spell is automatically extended without forcing the concentration check, so long as the rageshaper casts it while in a bloodrage. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a bloodrager gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the bloodrager takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every 3 levels thereafter, this damage reduction increases by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 11th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +3. In addition, upon entering a bloodrage, the bloodrager can apply the effects a bloodrager spell he knows of 2nd level or lower to himself. The spell must have a range of touch or personal. If the spell&#146;s duration is greater than 1 round, it instead lasts for the duration of the bloodrage. This use consumes a bloodrager spell slot, as if he had cast the spell; he must have the spell slot available to take advantage of this effect.</p>
					<p>Greater bloodrage counts as the barbarian&#146;s greater rage ability for the purposes of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a bloodrager gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells while bloodraging. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves he also receives during his bloodrage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 17th level, a bloodrager no longer becomes fatigued at the end of his bloodrage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 20th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +8, and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +4. Furthermore, the spell he can apply to himself at the beginning of a bloodrage due to the greater bloodrage class feature is not limited to only spells of 2nd level or lower.</p>

							<p>Each bloodrager has a source of magic somewhere in his heritage that empowers his bloodrages, bonus feats, and bonus spells. Sometimes this source reflects a distant blood relationship to a powerful being, or is due to an extreme event involving such a creature somewhere in his family&#146;s past. Regardless of the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways. A bloodrager must pick one bloodline upon taking his first level of bloodrager. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
							<p>When choosing a bloodline, the bloodrager&#146;s alignment doesn&#146;t restrict his choices. A good bloodrager could come from an abyssal bloodline, a celestial bloodline could beget an evil bloodrager generations later, a bloodrager from an infernal bloodline could be chaotic, and so on.

							<p>The bloodrager gains bloodline powers at 1st level, 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter. The bloodline powers a bloodrager gains are described in his chosen bloodline. For all spell-like bloodline powers, treat the character&#146;s bloodrager level as the caster level.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>Ancient catfolk legends claim their kind was created to protect the world from the sinister forces that exist at the world&#146;s fringes. Many catfolk bloodragers capable of communing with the ancient spirits of creation take on the burden of this ancient tradition.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>While many ferocious combatants can tap into a deep reservoir of buried rage, bloodragers have an intrinsic power that seethes within. Like sorcerers, bloodragers&#146; veins surge with arcane power. While sorcerers use this power for spellcasting, bloodragers enter an altered state in which their bloodline becomes manifest, where the echoes of their strange ancestry lash out with devastating power. In these states, bloodragers can cast some arcane spells instinctively. The bloodrager&#146;s magic is as fast, violent, and seemingly unstoppable as their physical prowess.</p>
					<p><b>Role: </b>Masters of the battlefield, bloodragers unleash fearful carnage on their enemies using their bloodlines and combat prowess. The bloodrager&#146;s place is on the front lines, right in his enemies&#146; faces, supplying tremendous martial force bolstered by a trace of arcane magic.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
					<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
					<p><b>Parent Class(es) </b>: Barbarian and sorcerer.</p>
					<p><b>Starting Wealth </b>: 3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
					<h>Class Skills</h>
					<p>The Bloodrager's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Perception (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
					<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Bloodragers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A bloodrager can cast bloodrager spells while wearing light armor or medium armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a bloodrager wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
					<p><b>Bloodline: Bloodline: </b>A prowler at world&#146;s end must choose the destined bloodline as his bloodline.</p>
					<p>Each bloodrager has a source of magic somewhere in his heritage that empowers his bloodrages, bonus feats, and bonus spells. Sometimes this source reflects a distant blood relationship to a powerful being, or is due to an extreme event involving such a creature somewhere in his family&#146;s past. Regardless of the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways. A bloodrager must pick one bloodline upon taking his first level of bloodrager. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
					<p>When choosing a bloodline, the bloodrager&#146;s alignment doesn&#146;t restrict his choices. A good bloodrager could come from an abyssal bloodline, a celestial bloodline could beget an evil bloodrager generations later, a bloodrager from an infernal bloodline could be chaotic, and so on. Though his bloodline empowers him, it doesn&#146;t dictate or limit his thoughts and behavior.</p>
					<p>The bloodrager gains bloodline powers at 1st level, 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter. The bloodline powers a bloodrager gains are described in his chosen bloodline. For all spell-like bloodline powers, treat the character&#146;s bloodrager level as the caster level.</p>
					<p>At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager receives one bonus feat chosen from a list specific to each bloodline. The bloodrager must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats.</p>
					<p>At 7th, 10th, 13th, and 16th levels, a bloodrager learns an additional spell derived from his bloodline. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 1&#150;4. These spells cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
					<p>If the bloodrager takes levels in another class that grants a bloodline, the bloodlines must be the same type, even if that means that the bloodline of one of the classes must change. Subject to GM discretion, the bloodrager can change his former bloodline to make them conform.</p>
					<p><b>Bloodline Powers: </b>At 4th level, a prowler at world&#146;s end gains the bloodline power normally granted by his bloodline at 1st level. At 9th level, he gains the bloodline power normally granted by his bloodline at 4th level. At 12th level, he gains the bloodline power normally granted by his bloodline at 8th level. At 15th level, he gains the bloodline power normally granted by his bloodline at 12th level. At 20th level, he gains the bloodline power normally granted by his bloodline at 16th level.</p>
					<p><b>Bloodrage (Su): </b>The bloodrager&#146;s source of internal power grants him the ability to bloodrage. At 1st level, a bloodrager can bloodrage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, he can bloodrage for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution (such as those gained from bloodraging or spells like bear&#146;s endurance) don&#146;t increase the total number of rounds that a bloodrager can bloodrage per day. The total number of rounds of bloodrage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours need not be consecutive.</p>
					<p>A bloodrager can enter a bloodrage as a free action. While in a bloodrage, a bloodrager gains a +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, he takes a &#150;2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the bloodrager 2 hit points per Hit Die, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While bloodraging, a bloodrager cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A bloodrager can end his bloodrage as a free action. When the bloodrage ends, he&#146;s fatigued for a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent in the bloodrage. A bloodrager cannot enter a new bloodrage while fatigued or exhausted, but can otherwise enter bloodrage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a bloodrager falls unconscious, his bloodrage immediately ends, placing him in peril of death.</p>
					<p>Bloodrage counts as the barbarian&#146;s rage class feature for the purpose of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>
					<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex): </b>A bloodrager&#146;s land speed is faster than is normal for his race by 10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the bloodrager&#146;s speed due to any armor worn or load carried. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the bloodrager&#146;s land speed.</p>
					<p><b>Spirit: </b>At 1st level, a prowler at world&#146;s end gains the ability to channel the spirits of creation, granting him the medium&#146;s spirit and spirit surge abilities. A prowler channels the cheetah (which acts as the trickster), the leopard (which acts as the guardian), the lion (which acts as the marshal), and the tiger (which acts as the champion). The prowler does not have access to the archmage or hierophant legends. The favored locations for these spirits are altars, churches, sacred groves, and shrines, and their taboo requires the prowler to strongly revere nature and attempt to either destroy or incapacitate evil wherever he encounters it.</p>
					<p>A prowler at world&#146;s end gains his spirit&#146;s lesser power at 1st level, its intermediate power at 8th level, and its greater power at 16th level. A prowler&#146;s spirit surge bonus never advances beyond 1d6.</p>
					<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 2nd level, a bloodrager can react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A bloodrager with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
					<p>If a bloodrager already possesses uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
					<p><b>Blood Sanctuary (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, due to the power of his blood, a bloodrager can stand confidently amid the effects of spells cast by himself or his allies. He gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells that he or an ally casts.</p>
					<p><b>Blood Casting (Su): </b>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains the ability to cast spells even while bloodraging. He can also cast these spells defensively and can make concentration checks for these spells while bloodraging. While bloodraging, he can cast and concentrate on only his bloodrager spells (see below); spells from other classes cannot be cast during this state.</p>
					<p><b>Eschew Materials: </b>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains Eschew Materials as a bonus feat.</p>
					<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a bloodrager gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells drawn from the bloodrager spell list. To learn or cast a spell, a bloodrager must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. He can cast spells he knows without preparing them ahead of time. The saving throw DC against a bloodrager&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the bloodrager&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a bloodrager can cast only a certain number of spells of each level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;3. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (Table 1-3: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). The bloodrager does not need to prepare these spells in advance; he can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he hasn&#146;t yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
					<p>The bloodrager&#146;s selection of spells is limited. At 4th level, a bloodrager knows two 1st-level spells of his choice. A bloodrager gains more spells as he increases in level, as indicated on Table 1&#150;4. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bloodrager knows is not affected by his Charisma score, but it is affected by any bonus spells he gains from his bloodline. At 8th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. This swap follows all the same rules as for a sorcerer.</p>
					<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a bloodrager can no longer be flanked. This defense denies rogues (or other classes with the sneak attack ability) the ability to sneak attack the bloodrager by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels (or levels in the class granting sneak attack) than the target has bloodrager levels.</p>
					<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack when determining the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a bloodrager gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the bloodrager takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every 3 levels thereafter, this damage reduction increases by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Chosen of the Spirits (Su) : </b>At 11th level, whenever a prowler at world&#146;s end enters a bloodrage, he can apply the effects of beast shape IV to himself instead of using greater bloodrage or mighty bloodrage to apply the effects of a bloodrager spell to himself. He must assume the form of a great cat of the same kind as a channeled spirit (cheetah, leopard, lion, or tiger). This effect lasts for as long as the prowler continues bloodraging, regardless of its normal duration, and using it does not consume a spell slot.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 11th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +3. In addition, upon entering a bloodrage, the bloodrager can apply the effects a bloodrager spell he knows of 2nd level or lower to himself. The spell must have a range of touch or personal. If the spell&#146;s duration is greater than 1 round, it instead lasts for the duration of the bloodrage. This use consumes a bloodrager spell slot, as if he had cast the spell; he must have the spell slot available to take advantage of this effect.</p>
					<p>Greater bloodrage counts as the barbarian&#146;s greater rage ability for the purposes of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>
					<p><b>Shapeshifted Spellcasting (Su) : </b>At 12th level, the prowler at world&#146;s end can cast spells while under the effects of chosen of the spirits. This ability functions as Natural Spell, except the prowler uses the ability to cast while under the effects of chosen of the spirits instead of wild shape.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a bloodrager gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells while bloodraging. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves he also receives during his bloodrage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 17th level, a bloodrager no longer becomes fatigued at the end of his bloodrage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 20th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +8, and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +4. Furthermore, the spell he can apply to himself at the beginning of a bloodrage due to the greater bloodrage class feature is not limited to only spells of 2nd level or lower.</p>

A bloodrager with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>

							<p>The bloodrager&#146;s source of internal power grants him the ability to bloodrage. At 1st level, a bloodrager can bloodrage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, he can bloodrage for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution (such as those gained from bloodraging or spells like bear&#146;s endurance) don&#146;t increase the total number of rounds that a bloodrager can bloodrage per day. The total number of rounds of bloodrage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours need not be consecutive.</p>
							<p>A bloodrager can enter a bloodrage as a free action. While in a bloodrage, a bloodrager gains a +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, he takes a &#150;2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the bloodrager 2 hit points per Hit Die, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While bloodraging, a bloodrager cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
							<p>A bloodrager can end his bloodrage as a free action. When the bloodrage ends, he&#146;s fatigued for a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent in the bloodrage. A bloodrager cannot enter a new bloodrage while fatigued or exhausted, but can otherwise enter bloodrage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a bloodrager falls unconscious, his bloodrage immediately ends, placing him in peril of death.</p>

							<p>Each bloodrager has a source of magic somewhere in his heritage that empowers his bloodrages, bonus feats, and bonus spells. Sometimes this source reflects a distant blood relationship to a powerful being, or is due to an extreme event involving such a creature somewhere in his family&#146;s past. Regardless of the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways. A bloodrager must pick one bloodline upon taking his first level of bloodrager. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>

							<p>The bloodrager gains bloodline powers at 1st level, 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter. The bloodline powers a bloodrager gains are described in his chosen bloodline. For all spell-like bloodline powers, treat the character&#146;s bloodrager level as the caster level.</p>
							<p>At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager receives one bonus feat chosen from a list specific to each bloodline. The bloodrager must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats.</p>

							<p>If the bloodrager takes levels in another class that grants a bloodline, the bloodlines must be the same type, even if that means that the bloodline of one of the classes must change. Subject to GM discretion, the bloodrager can change his former bloodline to make them conform.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>While bloodrage powers come from the very essence of a bloodrager&#146;s being and are often strict and immutable, some bloodragers tap into ancient traditions and primitive wisdom to enhance their rages with something more primal. The primalist mixes his bloodline with more traditional rage powers.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>While many ferocious combatants can tap into a deep reservoir of buried rage, bloodragers have an intrinsic power that seethes within. Like sorcerers, bloodragers&#146; veins surge with arcane power. While sorcerers use this power for spellcasting, bloodragers enter an altered state in which their bloodline becomes manifest, where the echoes of their strange ancestry lash out with devastating power. In these states, bloodragers can cast some arcane spells instinctively. The bloodrager&#146;s magic is as fast, violent, and seemingly unstoppable as their physical prowess.</p>
					<p><b>Role: </b>Masters of the battlefield, bloodragers unleash fearful carnage on their enemies using their bloodlines and combat prowess. The bloodrager&#146;s place is on the front lines, right in his enemies&#146; faces, supplying tremendous martial force bolstered by a trace of arcane magic.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
					<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
					<p><b>Parent Class(es) </b>: Barbarian and sorcerer.</p>
					<p><b>Starting Wealth </b>: 3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
					<h>Class Skills</h>
					<p>The Bloodrager's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Perception (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
					<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Bloodragers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A bloodrager can cast bloodrager spells while wearing light armor or medium armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a bloodrager wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
					<p><b>Bloodline: </b>Each bloodrager has a source of magic somewhere in his heritage that empowers his bloodrages, bonus feats, and bonus spells. Sometimes this source reflects a distant blood relationship to a powerful being, or is due to an extreme event involving such a creature somewhere in his family&#146;s past. Regardless of the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways. A bloodrager must pick one bloodline upon taking his first level of bloodrager. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
					<p>When choosing a bloodline, the bloodrager&#146;s alignment doesn&#146;t restrict his choices. A good bloodrager could come from an abyssal bloodline, a celestial bloodline could beget an evil bloodrager generations later, a bloodrager from an infernal bloodline could be chaotic, and so on. Though his bloodline empowers him, it doesn&#146;t dictate or limit his thoughts and behavior.</p>
					<p>The bloodrager gains bloodline powers at 1st level, 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter. The bloodline powers a bloodrager gains are described in his chosen bloodline. For all spell-like bloodline powers, treat the character&#146;s bloodrager level as the caster level.</p>
					<p>At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager receives one bonus feat chosen from a list specific to each bloodline. The bloodrager must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats.</p>
					<p>At 7th, 10th, 13th, and 16th levels, a bloodrager learns an additional spell derived from his bloodline. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 1&#150;4. These spells cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
					<p>If the bloodrager takes levels in another class that grants a bloodline, the bloodlines must be the same type, even if that means that the bloodline of one of the classes must change. Subject to GM discretion, the bloodrager can change his former bloodline to make them conform.</p>
					<p><b>Bloodrage (Su): </b>The bloodrager&#146;s source of internal power grants him the ability to bloodrage. At 1st level, a bloodrager can bloodrage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, he can bloodrage for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution (such as those gained from bloodraging or spells like bear&#146;s endurance) don&#146;t increase the total number of rounds that a bloodrager can bloodrage per day. The total number of rounds of bloodrage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours need not be consecutive.</p>
					<p>A bloodrager can enter a bloodrage as a free action. While in a bloodrage, a bloodrager gains a +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, he takes a &#150;2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the bloodrager 2 hit points per Hit Die, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While bloodraging, a bloodrager cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A bloodrager can end his bloodrage as a free action. When the bloodrage ends, he&#146;s fatigued for a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent in the bloodrage. A bloodrager cannot enter a new bloodrage while fatigued or exhausted, but can otherwise enter bloodrage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a bloodrager falls unconscious, his bloodrage immediately ends, placing him in peril of death.</p>
					<p>Bloodrage counts as the barbarian&#146;s rage class feature for the purpose of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>
					<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex): </b>A bloodrager&#146;s land speed is faster than is normal for his race by 10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the bloodrager&#146;s speed due to any armor worn or load carried. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the bloodrager&#146;s land speed.</p>
					<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 2nd level, a bloodrager can react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A bloodrager with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
					<p>If a bloodrager already possesses uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
					<p><b>Blood Sanctuary (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, due to the power of his blood, a bloodrager can stand confidently amid the effects of spells cast by himself or his allies. He gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells that he or an ally casts.</p>
					<p><b>Blood Casting (Su): </b>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains the ability to cast spells even while bloodraging. He can also cast these spells defensively and can make concentration checks for these spells while bloodraging. While bloodraging, he can cast and concentrate on only his bloodrager spells (see below); spells from other classes cannot be cast during this state.</p>
					<p><b>Eschew Materials: </b>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains Eschew Materials as a bonus feat.</p>
					<p><b>Primal Choices: </b>At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, a primalist can choose to take either his bloodline power or two barbarian rage powers. If the primalist chooses rage powers, those rage powers can be used in conjunction with his bloodrage, and his bloodrager level acts as his barbarian level when determining the effect of those bloodrage powers and any prerequisites. Any other prerequisites for a rage power must be met before a primalist can choose it. This ability does not count as the rage power class feature for determining feat prerequisites and other requirements. This ability alters the bloodline class feature.</p>
					<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a bloodrager gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells drawn from the bloodrager spell list. To learn or cast a spell, a bloodrager must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. He can cast spells he knows without preparing them ahead of time. The saving throw DC against a bloodrager&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the bloodrager&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a bloodrager can cast only a certain number of spells of each level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;3. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (Table 1-3: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). The bloodrager does not need to prepare these spells in advance; he can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he hasn&#146;t yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
					<p>The bloodrager&#146;s selection of spells is limited. At 4th level, a bloodrager knows two 1st-level spells of his choice. A bloodrager gains more spells as he increases in level, as indicated on Table 1&#150;4. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bloodrager knows is not affected by his Charisma score, but it is affected by any bonus spells he gains from his bloodline. At 8th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. This swap follows all the same rules as for a sorcerer.</p>
					<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a bloodrager can no longer be flanked. This defense denies rogues (or other classes with the sneak attack ability) the ability to sneak attack the bloodrager by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels (or levels in the class granting sneak attack) than the target has bloodrager levels.</p>
					<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack when determining the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a bloodrager gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the bloodrager takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every 3 levels thereafter, this damage reduction increases by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 11th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +3. In addition, upon entering a bloodrage, the bloodrager can apply the effects a bloodrager spell he knows of 2nd level or lower to himself. The spell must have a range of touch or personal. If the spell&#146;s duration is greater than 1 round, it instead lasts for the duration of the bloodrage. This use consumes a bloodrager spell slot, as if he had cast the spell; he must have the spell slot available to take advantage of this effect.</p>
					<p>Greater bloodrage counts as the barbarian&#146;s greater rage ability for the purposes of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a bloodrager gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells while bloodraging. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves he also receives during his bloodrage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 17th level, a bloodrager no longer becomes fatigued at the end of his bloodrage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 20th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +8, and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +4. Furthermore, the spell he can apply to himself at the beginning of a bloodrage due to the greater bloodrage class feature is not limited to only spells of 2nd level or lower.</p>

The metamagic rager does not have to be bloodraging to use this ability. The metamagic effect is applied without increasing the level of the spell slot expended, though the casting time is increased as normal. The metamagic rager can apply only one metamagic feat he knows in this manner with each casting. Additionally, when the metamagic rager takes a bloodline feat, he can choose to take a metamagic feat instead. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>While metamagic is difficult for many bloodragers to utilize, a talented few are able to channel their bloodrage in ways that push their spells to impressive ends.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>While many ferocious combatants can tap into a deep reservoir of buried rage, bloodragers have an intrinsic power that seethes within. Like sorcerers, bloodragers&#146; veins surge with arcane power. While sorcerers use this power for spellcasting, bloodragers enter an altered state in which their bloodline becomes manifest, where the echoes of their strange ancestry lash out with devastating power. In these states, bloodragers can cast some arcane spells instinctively. The bloodrager&#146;s magic is as fast, violent, and seemingly unstoppable as their physical prowess.</p>
					<p><b>Role: </b>Masters of the battlefield, bloodragers unleash fearful carnage on their enemies using their bloodlines and combat prowess. The bloodrager&#146;s place is on the front lines, right in his enemies&#146; faces, supplying tremendous martial force bolstered by a trace of arcane magic.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
					<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
					<p><b>Parent Class(es) </b>: Barbarian and sorcerer.</p>
					<p><b>Starting Wealth </b>: 3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
					<h>Class Skills</h>
					<p>The Bloodrager's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Perception (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
					<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Bloodragers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A bloodrager can cast bloodrager spells while wearing light armor or medium armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a bloodrager wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
					<p><b>Bloodline: </b>Each bloodrager has a source of magic somewhere in his heritage that empowers his bloodrages, bonus feats, and bonus spells. Sometimes this source reflects a distant blood relationship to a powerful being, or is due to an extreme event involving such a creature somewhere in his family&#146;s past. Regardless of the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways. A bloodrager must pick one bloodline upon taking his first level of bloodrager. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
					<p>When choosing a bloodline, the bloodrager&#146;s alignment doesn&#146;t restrict his choices. A good bloodrager could come from an abyssal bloodline, a celestial bloodline could beget an evil bloodrager generations later, a bloodrager from an infernal bloodline could be chaotic, and so on. Though his bloodline empowers him, it doesn&#146;t dictate or limit his thoughts and behavior.</p>
					<p>The bloodrager gains bloodline powers at 1st level, 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter. The bloodline powers a bloodrager gains are described in his chosen bloodline. For all spell-like bloodline powers, treat the character&#146;s bloodrager level as the caster level.</p>
					<p>At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager receives one bonus feat chosen from a list specific to each bloodline. The bloodrager must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats.</p>
					<p>At 7th, 10th, 13th, and 16th levels, a bloodrager learns an additional spell derived from his bloodline. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 1&#150;4. These spells cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
					<p>If the bloodrager takes levels in another class that grants a bloodline, the bloodlines must be the same type, even if that means that the bloodline of one of the classes must change. Subject to GM discretion, the bloodrager can change his former bloodline to make them conform.</p>
					<p><b>Bloodrage (Su): </b>The bloodrager&#146;s source of internal power grants him the ability to bloodrage. At 1st level, a bloodrager can bloodrage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, he can bloodrage for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution (such as those gained from bloodraging or spells like bear&#146;s endurance) don&#146;t increase the total number of rounds that a bloodrager can bloodrage per day. The total number of rounds of bloodrage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours need not be consecutive.</p>
					<p>A bloodrager can enter a bloodrage as a free action. While in a bloodrage, a bloodrager gains a +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, he takes a &#150;2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the bloodrager 2 hit points per Hit Die, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While bloodraging, a bloodrager cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A bloodrager can end his bloodrage as a free action. When the bloodrage ends, he&#146;s fatigued for a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent in the bloodrage. A bloodrager cannot enter a new bloodrage while fatigued or exhausted, but can otherwise enter bloodrage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a bloodrager falls unconscious, his bloodrage immediately ends, placing him in peril of death.</p>
					<p>Bloodrage counts as the barbarian&#146;s rage class feature for the purpose of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>
					<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex): </b>A bloodrager&#146;s land speed is faster than is normal for his race by 10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the bloodrager&#146;s speed due to any armor worn or load carried. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the bloodrager&#146;s land speed.</p>
					<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 2nd level, a bloodrager can react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A bloodrager with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
					<p>If a bloodrager already possesses uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
					<p><b>Blood Sanctuary (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, due to the power of his blood, a bloodrager can stand confidently amid the effects of spells cast by himself or his allies. He gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells that he or an ally casts.</p>
					<p><b>Blood Casting (Su): </b>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains the ability to cast spells even while bloodraging. He can also cast these spells defensively and can make concentration checks for these spells while bloodraging. While bloodraging, he can cast and concentrate on only his bloodrager spells (see below); spells from other classes cannot be cast during this state.</p>
					<p><b>Eschew Materials: </b>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains Eschew Materials as a bonus feat.</p>
					<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a bloodrager gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells drawn from the bloodrager spell list. To learn or cast a spell, a bloodrager must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. He can cast spells he knows without preparing them ahead of time. The saving throw DC against a bloodrager&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the bloodrager&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a bloodrager can cast only a certain number of spells of each level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;3. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (Table 1-3: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). The bloodrager does not need to prepare these spells in advance; he can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he hasn&#146;t yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
					<p>The bloodrager&#146;s selection of spells is limited. At 4th level, a bloodrager knows two 1st-level spells of his choice. A bloodrager gains more spells as he increases in level, as indicated on Table 1&#150;4. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bloodrager knows is not affected by his Charisma score, but it is affected by any bonus spells he gains from his bloodline. At 8th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. This swap follows all the same rules as for a sorcerer.</p>
					<p><b>Meta-Rage (Su): </b>At 5th level, a metamagic rager can sacrifice additional rounds of bloodrage to apply a metamagic feat he knows to a bloodrager spell. This costs a number of rounds of bloodrage equal to twice what the spell&#146;s adjusted level would normally be with the metamagic feat applied (minimum 2 rounds). The metamagic rager does not have to be bloodraging to use this ability. The metamagic effect is applied without increasing the level of the spell slot expended, though the casting time is increased as normal. The metamagic rager can apply only one metamagic feat he knows in this manner with each casting. Additionally, when the metamagic rager takes a bloodline feat, he can choose to take a metamagic feat instead. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a bloodrager gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the bloodrager takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every 3 levels thereafter, this damage reduction increases by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 11th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +3. In addition, upon entering a bloodrage, the bloodrager can apply the effects a bloodrager spell he knows of 2nd level or lower to himself. The spell must have a range of touch or personal. If the spell&#146;s duration is greater than 1 round, it instead lasts for the duration of the bloodrage. This use consumes a bloodrager spell slot, as if he had cast the spell; he must have the spell slot available to take advantage of this effect.</p>
					<p>Greater bloodrage counts as the barbarian&#146;s greater rage ability for the purposes of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a bloodrager gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells while bloodraging. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves he also receives during his bloodrage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 17th level, a bloodrager no longer becomes fatigued at the end of his bloodrage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 20th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +8, and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +4. Furthermore, the spell he can apply to himself at the beginning of a bloodrage due to the greater bloodrage class feature is not limited to only spells of 2nd level or lower.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>An id rager lacks a supernatural taint to his blood, instead drawing power from pure emotion.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>While many ferocious combatants can tap into a deep reservoir of buried rage, bloodragers have an intrinsic power that seethes within. Like sorcerers, bloodragers&#146; veins surge with arcane power. While sorcerers use this power for spellcasting, bloodragers enter an altered state in which their bloodline becomes manifest, where the echoes of their strange ancestry lash out with devastating power. In these states, bloodragers can cast some arcane spells instinctively. The bloodrager&#146;s magic is as fast, violent, and seemingly unstoppable as their physical prowess.</p>
					<p><b>Role: </b>Masters of the battlefield, bloodragers unleash fearful carnage on their enemies using their bloodlines and combat prowess. The bloodrager&#146;s place is on the front lines, right in his enemies&#146; faces, supplying tremendous martial force bolstered by a trace of arcane magic.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
					<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
					<p><b>Parent Class(es) </b>: Barbarian and sorcerer.</p>
					<p><b>Starting Wealth </b>: 3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
					<h>Class Skills</h>
					<p>The Bloodrager's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Perception (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
					<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Bloodragers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A bloodrager can cast bloodrager spells while wearing light armor or medium armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a bloodrager wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
					<p><b>Atavistic Avatar (Su): </b>An id rager chooses one emotional focus to define his core: anger, dedication, despair, fear, hatred, jealousy, remorse, or zeal. At 1st level, he gains Skill Focus as a bonus feat in one skill associated with his atavistic focus.</p>
					<list>
						<li>Anger: Intimidate or Survival.</li>
						<li>Dedication: Diplomacy or Sense Motive.</li>
						<li>Despair: Intimidate or Stealth.</li>
						<li>Fear: Intimidate or Stealth.</li>
						<li>Hatred: Acrobatics or Perception.</li>
						<li>Jealousy: Appraise or Bluff.</li>
						<li>Remorse: Perception or Sense Motive.</li>
						<li>Zeal: Acrobatics or Survival.</li>
					</list>
					<p>When the id rager enters a bloodrage, he gains additional powers as if he were a phantom with the emotional focus he selected as his atavistic focus. He is considered to be both a phantom and a spiritualist for the purposes of abilities whose effect references both a phantom and a spiritualist, such as a dedication phantom&#146;s dutiful strike, and treats his bloodrager level as both his spiritualist level and his phantom Hit Dice when determining abilities and save DCs. This ability does not allow the id rager to become incorporeal.</p>
					<p>At 4th level, the id rager gains Lightning Reflexes, Great Fortitude, or Iron Will as a bonus feat.</p>
					<p>At 8th level, the id rager can meditate for 1 hour to change his atavistic focus for 24 hours or until he decides to return to his permanent atavistic focus as a free action. When he changes his focus, he loses access to his Skill Focus feat and the feat he gained at 4th level, and he wields emotional focus powers as if his spiritualist level and phantom Hit Dice were 3 lower.</p>
					<p>At 12th level, the id rager gains Skill Focus in both of the skills associated with his atavistic focus. If circumstances cause him to lose one Skill Focus feat, he loses both.</p>
					<p><b>Bloodrage (Su): </b>The bloodrager&#146;s source of internal power grants him the ability to bloodrage. At 1st level, a bloodrager can bloodrage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, he can bloodrage for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution (such as those gained from bloodraging or spells like bear&#146;s endurance) don&#146;t increase the total number of rounds that a bloodrager can bloodrage per day. The total number of rounds of bloodrage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours need not be consecutive.</p>
					<p>A bloodrager can enter a bloodrage as a free action. While in a bloodrage, a bloodrager gains a +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, he takes a &#150;2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the bloodrager 2 hit points per Hit Die, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While bloodraging, a bloodrager cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A bloodrager can end his bloodrage as a free action. When the bloodrage ends, he&#146;s fatigued for a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent in the bloodrage. A bloodrager cannot enter a new bloodrage while fatigued or exhausted, but can otherwise enter bloodrage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a bloodrager falls unconscious, his bloodrage immediately ends, placing him in peril of death.</p>
					<p>Bloodrage counts as the barbarian&#146;s rage class feature for the purpose of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>
					<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex): </b>A bloodrager&#146;s land speed is faster than is normal for his race by 10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the bloodrager&#146;s speed due to any armor worn or load carried. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the bloodrager&#146;s land speed.</p>
					<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 2nd level, a bloodrager can react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A bloodrager with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
					<p>If a bloodrager already possesses uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
					<p><b>Blood Sanctuary (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, due to the power of his blood, a bloodrager can stand confidently amid the effects of spells cast by himself or his allies. He gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells that he or an ally casts.</p>
					<p><b>Atavistic Caster: </b>At 4th level, a id rager&#146;s bloodrager spells are treated as psychic magic (Occult Adventures 144). The bloodrager&#146;s bloodrage does not prevent him from casting spells with emotional components, and he is considered to be a psychic spellcaster for the purposes of prerequisites (such as for the prerequisites of psychic duels and occult skill unlocks). This ability alters the bloodrager&#146;s spellcasting and replaces eschew materials.</p>
					<p><b>Blood Casting (Su): </b>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains the ability to cast spells even while bloodraging. He can also cast these spells defensively and can make concentration checks for these spells while bloodraging. While bloodraging, he can cast and concentrate on only his bloodrager spells (see below); spells from other classes cannot be cast during this state.</p>
					<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a bloodrager gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells drawn from the bloodrager spell list. To learn or cast a spell, a bloodrager must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. He can cast spells he knows without preparing them ahead of time. The saving throw DC against a bloodrager&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the bloodrager&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a bloodrager can cast only a certain number of spells of each level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;3. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (Table 1-3: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). The bloodrager does not need to prepare these spells in advance; he can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he hasn&#146;t yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
					<p>The bloodrager&#146;s selection of spells is limited. At 4th level, a bloodrager knows two 1st-level spells of his choice. A bloodrager gains more spells as he increases in level, as indicated on Table 1&#150;4. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bloodrager knows is not affected by his Charisma score, but it is affected by any bonus spells he gains from his bloodline. At 8th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. This swap follows all the same rules as for a sorcerer.</p>
					<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a bloodrager can no longer be flanked. This defense denies rogues (or other classes with the sneak attack ability) the ability to sneak attack the bloodrager by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels (or levels in the class granting sneak attack) than the target has bloodrager levels.</p>
					<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack when determining the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
					<p><b>Bonus Feats: </b>At 6th level and every 3 bloodrager levels thereafter, an id rager can select one of the following feats as a bonus feat: Combat Casting, Empath, Extra Rage, Intuitive Spell, Logical Spell, Psychic Combatant, Psychic Defender, Psychic Healing, Psychic Maestro, Psychic Virtuoso, Raging Concentration, Spell Focus, or Spell Penetration. This ability replaces all bloodline feats.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a bloodrager gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the bloodrager takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every 3 levels thereafter, this damage reduction increases by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 11th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +3. In addition, upon entering a bloodrage, the bloodrager can apply the effects a bloodrager spell he knows of 2nd level or lower to himself. The spell must have a range of touch or personal. If the spell&#146;s duration is greater than 1 round, it instead lasts for the duration of the bloodrage. This use consumes a bloodrager spell slot, as if he had cast the spell; he must have the spell slot available to take advantage of this effect.</p>
					<p>Greater bloodrage counts as the barbarian&#146;s greater rage ability for the purposes of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a bloodrager gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells while bloodraging. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves he also receives during his bloodrage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 17th level, a bloodrager no longer becomes fatigued at the end of his bloodrage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 20th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +8, and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +4. Furthermore, the spell he can apply to himself at the beginning of a bloodrage due to the greater bloodrage class feature is not limited to only spells of 2nd level or lower.</p>

Temporary increases to Constitution (such as those gained from bloodraging or spells like bear&#146;s endurance) don&#146;t increase the total number of rounds that a bloodrager can bloodrage per day.

							<p>A bloodrager can enter a bloodrage as a free action. While in a bloodrage, a bloodrager gains a +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, he takes a &#150;2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the bloodrager 2 hit points per Hit Die, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points.

							<p>Each bloodrager has a source of magic somewhere in his heritage that empowers his bloodrages, bonus feats, and bonus spells. Sometimes this source reflects a distant blood relationship to a powerful being, or is due to an extreme event involving such a creature somewhere in his family&#146;s past. Regardless of the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways. A bloodrager must pick one bloodline upon taking his first level of bloodrager. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>

A good bloodrager could come from an abyssal bloodline, a celestial bloodline could beget an evil bloodrager generations later, a bloodrager from an infernal bloodline could be chaotic, and so on. Though his bloodline empowers him, it doesn&#146;t dictate or limit his thoughts and behavior.</p>
							<p>The bloodrager gains bloodline powers at 1st level, 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter. The bloodline powers a bloodrager gains are described in his chosen bloodline. For all spell-like bloodline powers, treat the character&#146;s bloodrager level as the caster level.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>All changelings have the potential to transform into hags, but the process is a slow one, requiring several nights to complete. When left incomplete&#151;by virtue of a wily changeling&#146;s escape or her mother&#146;s death&#151;the creature is scarred and saturated in arcane power. Though she remains in possession of her own faculties, the seeds of hag hatred sprout within her. These hag-riven wield powerful magic interlaced with more powerful emotions.</i></p>
					<p><i>The painful rituals that create a hag-riven can work for any creatures tenacious enough to endure them, and the art has sprung up as a defense against the devastating power of hags in various remote communities.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>While many ferocious combatants can tap into a deep reservoir of buried rage, bloodragers have an intrinsic power that seethes within. Like sorcerers, bloodragers&#146; veins surge with arcane power. While sorcerers use this power for spellcasting, bloodragers enter an altered state in which their bloodline becomes manifest, where the echoes of their strange ancestry lash out with devastating power. In these states, bloodragers can cast some arcane spells instinctively. The bloodrager&#146;s magic is as fast, violent, and seemingly unstoppable as their physical prowess.</p>
					<p><b>Role: </b>Masters of the battlefield, bloodragers unleash fearful carnage on their enemies using their bloodlines and combat prowess. The bloodrager&#146;s place is on the front lines, right in his enemies&#146; faces, supplying tremendous martial force bolstered by a trace of arcane magic.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
					<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
					<p><b>Parent Class(es) </b>: Barbarian and sorcerer.</p>
					<p><b>Starting Wealth </b>: 3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
					<h>Class Skills</h>
					<p>The Bloodrager's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Perception (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
					<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Bloodragers are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A bloodrager can cast bloodrager spells while wearing light armor or medium armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a bloodrager wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
					<p><b>Arcane Influence: </b>A hag-riven bloodrager does not gain proficiency with martial weapons and must choose from one of the following bloodrager bloodlines: arcane, destined, elemental, fey, or hag.</p>
					<p><b>Bloodline: </b>Each bloodrager has a source of magic somewhere in his heritage that empowers his bloodrages, bonus feats, and bonus spells. Sometimes this source reflects a distant blood relationship to a powerful being, or is due to an extreme event involving such a creature somewhere in his family&#146;s past. Regardless of the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways. A bloodrager must pick one bloodline upon taking his first level of bloodrager. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
					<p>When choosing a bloodline, the bloodrager&#146;s alignment doesn&#146;t restrict his choices. A good bloodrager could come from an abyssal bloodline, a celestial bloodline could beget an evil bloodrager generations later, a bloodrager from an infernal bloodline could be chaotic, and so on. Though his bloodline empowers him, it doesn&#146;t dictate or limit his thoughts and behavior.</p>
					<p>The bloodrager gains bloodline powers at 1st level, 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter. The bloodline powers a bloodrager gains are described in his chosen bloodline. For all spell-like bloodline powers, treat the character&#146;s bloodrager level as the caster level.</p>
					<p>At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager receives one bonus feat chosen from a list specific to each bloodline. The bloodrager must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats.</p>
					<p>At 7th, 10th, 13th, and 16th levels, a bloodrager learns an additional spell derived from his bloodline. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 1&#150;4. These spells cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
					<p>If the bloodrager takes levels in another class that grants a bloodline, the bloodlines must be the same type, even if that means that the bloodline of one of the classes must change. Subject to GM discretion, the bloodrager can change his former bloodline to make them conform.</p>
					<p><b>Bloodrage (Su): </b>The bloodrager&#146;s source of internal power grants him the ability to bloodrage. At 1st level, a bloodrager can bloodrage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, he can bloodrage for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution (such as those gained from bloodraging or spells like bear&#146;s endurance) don&#146;t increase the total number of rounds that a bloodrager can bloodrage per day. The total number of rounds of bloodrage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours need not be consecutive.</p>
					<p>A bloodrager can enter a bloodrage as a free action. While in a bloodrage, a bloodrager gains a +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, he takes a &#150;2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the bloodrager 2 hit points per Hit Die, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While bloodraging, a bloodrager cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A bloodrager can end his bloodrage as a free action. When the bloodrage ends, he&#146;s fatigued for a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent in the bloodrage. A bloodrager cannot enter a new bloodrage while fatigued or exhausted, but can otherwise enter bloodrage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a bloodrager falls unconscious, his bloodrage immediately ends, placing him in peril of death.</p>
					<p>Bloodrage counts as the barbarian&#146;s rage class feature for the purpose of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>
					<p><b>Claws of the Hag (Ex): </b>A hag-riven grows a pair of vicious claws that are treated as natural weapons. These claws are primary attacks and deal 1d4 points of damage each (1d3 for a Small creature) plus the hag-riven&#146;s Strength modifier. At 2nd level, these claws are considered magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 5th level, the damage increases to 1d6 points (1d4 for a Small creature). At 13th level, the hag-riven&#146;s claws threaten a critical hit on a natural roll of 19&#150;20. At 16th level, the damage increases again to 1d8 points (1d6 for a Small creature).</p>
					<p><b>Blood Sanctuary (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, due to the power of his blood, a bloodrager can stand confidently amid the effects of spells cast by himself or his allies. He gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells that he or an ally casts.</p>
					<p><b>Blood Casting (Su): </b>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains the ability to cast spells even while bloodraging. He can also cast these spells defensively and can make concentration checks for these spells while bloodraging. While bloodraging, he can cast and concentrate on only his bloodrager spells (see below); spells from other classes cannot be cast during this state.</p>
					<p><b>Eschew Materials: </b>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains Eschew Materials as a bonus feat.</p>
					<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a bloodrager gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells drawn from the bloodrager spell list. To learn or cast a spell, a bloodrager must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. He can cast spells he knows without preparing them ahead of time. The saving throw DC against a bloodrager&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the bloodrager&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a bloodrager can cast only a certain number of spells of each level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;3. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (Table 1-3: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). The bloodrager does not need to prepare these spells in advance; he can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he hasn&#146;t yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
					<p>The bloodrager&#146;s selection of spells is limited. At 4th level, a bloodrager knows two 1st-level spells of his choice. A bloodrager gains more spells as he increases in level, as indicated on Table 1&#150;4. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bloodrager knows is not affected by his Charisma score, but it is affected by any bonus spells he gains from his bloodline. At 8th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. This swap follows all the same rules as for a sorcerer.</p>
					<p><b>Sorcerous Claws (Su): </b>At 5th level, a hag-riven can expend one of her daily spell slots as a swift action to grant her claws an enhancement bonus equal to the level of the spell slot sacrificed. This bonus lasts for 1 minute and stacks with existing enhancement bonuses (such as those provided by magic fang or magic items) to a maximum of +5. Multiple uses of this ability do not stack with themselves.</p>
					<p>Beginning at 7th level, the hag-riven can also expend some or all of the bonus provided by her sorcerous claws to add any of the following weapon properties to her claws for 1 minute: flaming, flaming burst, frost, icy burst, keen, nullifying, seaborne, spellstealing, shock, shocking burst, or wounding. Her claws must have a minimum enhancement bonus of +1 before any special abilities can be added.</p>
					<p><b>Scarred Hide (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a hag-riven&#146;s scarred flesh becomes thick and leathery. She gains a +1 natural armor bonus to AC. At 10th, 13th, 16th, and 19th levels, this bonus increases by 1.</p>
					<p><b>Hexing Claws (Su): </b>At 10th level, a hag-riven gains Critical Focus as a bonus feat, but she can apply its benefits only to her claw attacks. Each morning, she can select a single feat with Critical Focus as a prerequisite and apply its benefits to her claw attacks. She must meet all other prerequisites for any feat she wishes to apply with this ability.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 11th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +3. In addition, upon entering a bloodrage, the bloodrager can apply the effects a bloodrager spell he knows of 2nd level or lower to himself. The spell must have a range of touch or personal. If the spell&#146;s duration is greater than 1 round, it instead lasts for the duration of the bloodrage. This use consumes a bloodrager spell slot, as if he had cast the spell; he must have the spell slot available to take advantage of this effect.</p>
					<p>Greater bloodrage counts as the barbarian&#146;s greater rage ability for the purposes of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a bloodrager gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells while bloodraging. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves he also receives during his bloodrage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 17th level, a bloodrager no longer becomes fatigued at the end of his bloodrage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 20th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +8, and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +4. Furthermore, the spell he can apply to himself at the beginning of a bloodrage due to the greater bloodrage class feature is not limited to only spells of 2nd level or lower.</p>

							<p>If the bloodrager takes levels in another class that grants a bloodline, the bloodlines must be the same type, even if that means that the bloodline of one of the classes must change. Subject to GM discretion, the bloodrager can change his former bloodline to make them conform.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>Typically, nature finds its greatest harmony with divine magic, but sometimes a connection with the natural world manifest itself through the arcane current in the veins of the bloodragers called greenragers. These bloodragers funnel their eldritch heritage into abilities that allow them to call powerful allies from nature and empower them with their bloodrage.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>While many ferocious combatants can tap into a deep reservoir of buried rage, bloodragers have an intrinsic power that seethes within. Like sorcerers, bloodragers&#146; veins surge with arcane power. While sorcerers use this power for spellcasting, bloodragers enter an altered state in which their bloodline becomes manifest, where the echoes of their strange ancestry lash out with devastating power. In these states, bloodragers can cast some arcane spells instinctively. The bloodrager&#146;s magic is as fast, violent, and seemingly unstoppable as their physical prowess.</p>
					<p><b>Role: </b>Masters of the battlefield, bloodragers unleash fearful carnage on their enemies using their bloodlines and combat prowess. The bloodrager&#146;s place is on the front lines, right in his enemies&#146; faces, supplying tremendous martial force bolstered by a trace of arcane magic.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
					<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
					<p><b>Parent Class(es) </b>: Barbarian and sorcerer.</p>
					<p><b>Starting Wealth </b>: 3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
					<h>Class Skills</h>
					<p>The Bloodrager's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Perception (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
					<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Bloodragers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A bloodrager can cast bloodrager spells while wearing light armor or medium armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a bloodrager wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
					<p><b>Bloodline: </b>Each bloodrager has a source of magic somewhere in his heritage that empowers his bloodrages, bonus feats, and bonus spells. Sometimes this source reflects a distant blood relationship to a powerful being, or is due to an extreme event involving such a creature somewhere in his family&#146;s past. Regardless of the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways. A bloodrager must pick one bloodline upon taking his first level of bloodrager. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
					<p>When choosing a bloodline, the bloodrager&#146;s alignment doesn&#146;t restrict his choices. A good bloodrager could come from an abyssal bloodline, a celestial bloodline could beget an evil bloodrager generations later, a bloodrager from an infernal bloodline could be chaotic, and so on. Though his bloodline empowers him, it doesn&#146;t dictate or limit his thoughts and behavior.</p>
					<p>The bloodrager gains bloodline powers at 1st level, 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter. The bloodline powers a bloodrager gains are described in his chosen bloodline. For all spell-like bloodline powers, treat the character&#146;s bloodrager level as the caster level.</p>
					<p>At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager receives one bonus feat chosen from a list specific to each bloodline. The bloodrager must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats.</p>
					<p>At 7th, 10th, 13th, and 16th levels, a bloodrager learns an additional spell derived from his bloodline. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 1&#150;4. These spells cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
					<p>If the bloodrager takes levels in another class that grants a bloodline, the bloodlines must be the same type, even if that means that the bloodline of one of the classes must change. Subject to GM discretion, the bloodrager can change his former bloodline to make them conform.</p>
					<p><b>Bloodrage (Su): </b>The bloodrager&#146;s source of internal power grants him the ability to bloodrage. At 1st level, a bloodrager can bloodrage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, he can bloodrage for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution (such as those gained from bloodraging or spells like bear&#146;s endurance) don&#146;t increase the total number of rounds that a bloodrager can bloodrage per day. The total number of rounds of bloodrage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours need not be consecutive.</p>
					<p>A bloodrager can enter a bloodrage as a free action. While in a bloodrage, a bloodrager gains a +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, he takes a &#150;2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the bloodrager 2 hit points per Hit Die, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While bloodraging, a bloodrager cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A bloodrager can end his bloodrage as a free action. When the bloodrage ends, he&#146;s fatigued for a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent in the bloodrage. A bloodrager cannot enter a new bloodrage while fatigued or exhausted, but can otherwise enter bloodrage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a bloodrager falls unconscious, his bloodrage immediately ends, placing him in peril of death.</p>
					<p>Bloodrage counts as the barbarian&#146;s rage class feature for the purpose of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>
					<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex): </b>A bloodrager&#146;s land speed is faster than is normal for his race by 10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the bloodrager&#146;s speed due to any armor worn or load carried. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the bloodrager&#146;s land speed.</p>
					<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 2nd level, a bloodrager can react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A bloodrager with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
					<p>If a bloodrager already possesses uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
					<p><b>Unfettered Fury (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a greenrager&#146;s fury allows him to move through undergrowth with frightening speed and grace. This functions as the druid&#146;s woodland stride class feature, but only while the greenrager is bloodraging. This ability replaces blood sanctuary.</p>
					<p><b>Blood Casting (Su): </b>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains the ability to cast spells even while bloodraging. He can also cast these spells defensively and can make concentration checks for these spells while bloodraging. While bloodraging, he can cast and concentrate on only his bloodrager spells (see below); spells from other classes cannot be cast during this state.</p>
					<p><b>Eschew Materials: </b>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains Eschew Materials as a bonus feat.</p>
					<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a bloodrager gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells drawn from the bloodrager spell list. To learn or cast a spell, a bloodrager must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. He can cast spells he knows without preparing them ahead of time. The saving throw DC against a bloodrager&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the bloodrager&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a bloodrager can cast only a certain number of spells of each level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;3. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (Table 1-3: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). The bloodrager does not need to prepare these spells in advance; he can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he hasn&#146;t yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
					<p>The bloodrager&#146;s selection of spells is limited. At 4th level, a bloodrager knows two 1st-level spells of his choice. A bloodrager gains more spells as he increases in level, as indicated on Table 1&#150;4. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bloodrager knows is not affected by his Charisma score, but it is affected by any bonus spells he gains from his bloodline. At 8th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. This swap follows all the same rules as for a sorcerer.</p>
					<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a bloodrager can no longer be flanked. This defense denies rogues (or other classes with the sneak attack ability) the ability to sneak attack the bloodrager by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels (or levels in the class granting sneak attack) than the target has bloodrager levels.</p>
					<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack when determining the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
					<p><b>Summoning Rager (Sp): </b>At 6th level, a greenrager&#146;s magic unlocks the secrets of summoning allies from nature. He adds summon nature&#146;s ally I to his list of 1st-level bloodrager spells known as a bonus spell, as if it were a bonus bloodrager spell. At 7th level, he adds summon nature&#146;s ally II as a bonus 2nd-level bloodrager spell, at 10th level he adds summon nature&#146;s ally III as a bonus 3rd level bloodrager spell, and at 13th level he adds summon nature&#146;s ally IV as a bonus 4th-level bloodrager spell. This ability replaces the bloodline feat gained at 6th level.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a bloodrager gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the bloodrager takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every 3 levels thereafter, this damage reduction increases by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Furious Summoning (Su): </b>At 9th level, creatures summoned by the bloodrager&#146;s summon nature&#146;s ally spell gain a +4 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and gain the druid&#146;s woodland stride ability. At 11th level, this bonus increases to +6. At 20th level, it increases to +8. This ability replaces the bloodline feat at 9th level.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 11th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +3. In addition, upon entering a bloodrage, the bloodrager can apply the effects a bloodrager spell he knows of 2nd level or lower to himself. The spell must have a range of touch or personal. If the spell&#146;s duration is greater than 1 round, it instead lasts for the duration of the bloodrage. This use consumes a bloodrager spell slot, as if he had cast the spell; he must have the spell slot available to take advantage of this effect.</p>
					<p>Greater bloodrage counts as the barbarian&#146;s greater rage ability for the purposes of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a bloodrager gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells while bloodraging. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves he also receives during his bloodrage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 17th level, a bloodrager no longer becomes fatigued at the end of his bloodrage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 20th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +8, and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +4. Furthermore, the spell he can apply to himself at the beginning of a bloodrage due to the greater bloodrage class feature is not limited to only spells of 2nd level or lower.</p>

Temporary increases to Constitution (such as those gained from bloodraging or spells like bear&#146;s endurance) don&#146;t increase the total number of rounds that a bloodrager can bloodrage per day.

The increase to Constitution grants the bloodrager 2 hit points per Hit Die, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points.

							<p>Each bloodrager has a source of magic somewhere in his heritage that empowers his bloodrages, bonus feats, and bonus spells. Sometimes this source reflects a distant blood relationship to a powerful being, or is due to an extreme event involving such a creature somewhere in his family&#146;s past.

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>Troubled by overwhelming rage and mystic forces beyond their comprehension, bloodragers have been traveling to the Magaambya for generations, seeking the peace and enlightenment promised by students of Old-Mage Jatembe. Many perish or succumb to their bloodlust long before arriving at the school, but those who survive that journey and dedicate themselves to Jatembe&#146;s teachings eventually learn to control their anger and suppress the worst influences of their bloodlines.</i></p>
					<p><i>Once a bloodrager takes the teachings of the Magaambya into her heart and mind, she unlocks a unique method of casting her violent, rage-fueled spells. As a result, an enlightened bloodrager&#146;s magic looks, feels, and functions quite differently from the magic of other bloodragers. In many cases, when an enlightened bloodrager encounters a more traditional bloodrager, the meeting is laced with tension and suspicion. The enlightened bloodrager is, of course, well aware of the other bloodrager&#146;s tendency toward violence, and the other bloodrager is often unnerved by the calm and reasoned mannerisms of his enlightened counterpart. Many bloodragers even take offense at this demeanor, interpreting the enlightened bloodrager as a pawn of intellectuals or as having dishonored her ancestry or traditions by abandoning emotion and wrath. As one can well expect, such confrontations rarely result in lasting friendships!</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>While many ferocious combatants can tap into a deep reservoir of buried rage, bloodragers have an intrinsic power that seethes within. Like sorcerers, bloodragers&#146; veins surge with arcane power. While sorcerers use this power for spellcasting, bloodragers enter an altered state in which their bloodline becomes manifest, where the echoes of their strange ancestry lash out with devastating power. In these states, bloodragers can cast some arcane spells instinctively. The bloodrager&#146;s magic is as fast, violent, and seemingly unstoppable as their physical prowess.</p>
					<p><b>Role: </b>Masters of the battlefield, bloodragers unleash fearful carnage on their enemies using their bloodlines and combat prowess. The bloodrager&#146;s place is on the front lines, right in his enemies&#146; faces, supplying tremendous martial force bolstered by a trace of arcane magic.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Bloodragers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A bloodrager can cast bloodrager spells while wearing light armor or medium armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a bloodrager wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
					<p><b>Bloodline: </b>Each bloodrager has a source of magic somewhere in his heritage that empowers his bloodrages, bonus feats, and bonus spells. Sometimes this source reflects a distant blood relationship to a powerful being, or is due to an extreme event involving such a creature somewhere in his family&#146;s past. Regardless of the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways. A bloodrager must pick one bloodline upon taking his first level of bloodrager. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
					<p>When choosing a bloodline, the bloodrager&#146;s alignment doesn&#146;t restrict his choices. A good bloodrager could come from an abyssal bloodline, a celestial bloodline could beget an evil bloodrager generations later, a bloodrager from an infernal bloodline could be chaotic, and so on. Though his bloodline empowers him, it doesn&#146;t dictate or limit his thoughts and behavior.</p>
					<p>The bloodrager gains bloodline powers at 1st level, 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter. The bloodline powers a bloodrager gains are described in his chosen bloodline. For all spell-like bloodline powers, treat the character&#146;s bloodrager level as the caster level.</p>
					<p>At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager receives one bonus feat chosen from a list specific to each bloodline. The bloodrager must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats.</p>
					<p>At 7th, 10th, 13th, and 16th levels, a bloodrager learns an additional spell derived from his bloodline. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 1&#150;4. These spells cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
					<p>If the bloodrager takes levels in another class that grants a bloodline, the bloodlines must be the same type, even if that means that the bloodline of one of the classes must change. Subject to GM discretion, the bloodrager can change his former bloodline to make them conform.</p>
					<p><b>Bloodrage (Su): </b>The bloodrager&#146;s source of internal power grants him the ability to bloodrage. At 1st level, a bloodrager can bloodrage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, he can bloodrage for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution (such as those gained from bloodraging or spells like bear&#146;s endurance) don&#146;t increase the total number of rounds that a bloodrager can bloodrage per day. The total number of rounds of bloodrage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours need not be consecutive.</p>
					<p>A bloodrager can enter a bloodrage as a free action. While in a bloodrage, a bloodrager gains a +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, he takes a &#150;2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the bloodrager 2 hit points per Hit Die, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While bloodraging, a bloodrager cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A bloodrager can end his bloodrage as a free action. When the bloodrage ends, he&#146;s fatigued for a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent in the bloodrage. A bloodrager cannot enter a new bloodrage while fatigued or exhausted, but can otherwise enter bloodrage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a bloodrager falls unconscious, his bloodrage immediately ends, placing him in peril of death.</p>
					<p>Bloodrage counts as the barbarian&#146;s rage class feature for the purpose of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>
					<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex): </b>A bloodrager&#146;s land speed is faster than is normal for his race by 10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the bloodrager&#146;s speed due to any armor worn or load carried. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the bloodrager&#146;s land speed.</p>
					<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 2nd level, a bloodrager can react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A bloodrager with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
					<p>If a bloodrager already possesses uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
					<p><b>Blood Sanctuary (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, due to the power of his blood, a bloodrager can stand confidently amid the effects of spells cast by himself or his allies. He gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells that he or an ally casts.</p>
					<p><b>Blood Casting (Su): </b>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains the ability to cast spells even while bloodraging. He can also cast these spells defensively and can make concentration checks for these spells while bloodraging. While bloodraging, he can cast and concentrate on only his bloodrager spells (see below); spells from other classes cannot be cast during this state.</p>
					<p><b>Enlightened Spellcasting: </b>An enlightened bloodrager&#146;s unusually sophisticated outlook on the relationship between magic and emotional outbursts allows her to cast an expanded array of spells. She gains the ability to know and cast 0-level spells, which are cast like any other spells, but don&#146;t consume spell slots and can be used again. At 4th level, she gains a number of 0-level spells known equal to those of a bard whose level is 3 lower than her bloodrager level. She selects these 0-level spells from the druid&#146;s list of 0-level spells.</p>
					<p>At 4th level, the enlightened bloodrager gains one 1st-level druid spell as a bonus spell known. At 7th level, she gains one 2nd-level druid spell as a bonus spell known. At 10th level, she gains one 3rd-level druid spell as a bonus spell known. At 13th level, she gains one 4th-level druid spell as a bonus spell known.</p>
					<p>The bloodrager treats any druid spells she takes with this ability as bloodrager spells for the purposes of other abilities, and adds them to her bloodrager class spell list. At 8th level and every 3 spell levels thereafter, she can swap out these spells using the normal rules for swapping out at a spell. If she chooses to swap out one of her bonus druid spells, she must replace it with a druid spell of the same level. Any swapped-out spells are removed from her bloodrager class spell list.</p>
					<p>This ability alters the bloodrager&#146;s spellcasting, and replaces the bloodline power the bloodrager normally gains at 1st level and all bonus spells gained as part of a bloodline.</p>
					<p><b>Enlightened Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 4th level, while bloodraging, an enlightened bloodrager can still use Intelligence-, Dexterity-, and Charisma-based skills and can use abilities that require patience or concentration.</p>
					<p><b>Eschew Materials: </b>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains Eschew Materials as a bonus feat.</p>
					<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a bloodrager gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells drawn from the bloodrager spell list. To learn or cast a spell, a bloodrager must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. He can cast spells he knows without preparing them ahead of time. The saving throw DC against a bloodrager&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the bloodrager&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a bloodrager can cast only a certain number of spells of each level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;3. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (Table 1-3: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). The bloodrager does not need to prepare these spells in advance; he can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he hasn&#146;t yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
					<p>The bloodrager&#146;s selection of spells is limited. At 4th level, a bloodrager knows two 1st-level spells of his choice. A bloodrager gains more spells as he increases in level, as indicated on Table 1&#150;4. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bloodrager knows is not affected by his Charisma score, but it is affected by any bonus spells he gains from his bloodline. At 8th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. This swap follows all the same rules as for a sorcerer.</p>
					<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a bloodrager can no longer be flanked. This defense denies rogues (or other classes with the sneak attack ability) the ability to sneak attack the bloodrager by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels (or levels in the class granting sneak attack) than the target has bloodrager levels.</p>
					<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack when determining the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
					<p><b>Bloodline Feat: </b>At 6th level, an enlightened bloodrager adds Expanded Arcana, Nameless One, and all feats that list Nameless One as a prerequisite to the list of feats she can select as a bloodline feat.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a bloodrager gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the bloodrager takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every 3 levels thereafter, this damage reduction increases by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Bloodline Powers: </b>At 8th level, an enlightened bloodrager gains the bloodline power normally granted at 1st level. At 12th level she gains the bloodline power normally granted at 4th level, at 16th level she gains the bloodline power normally granted at 8th level, and at 20th level she gains the bloodline power normally gained at 12th level. She still uses her full bloodrager level when making level-based calculations in regard to these abilities.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 11th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +3. In addition, upon entering a bloodrage, the bloodrager can apply the effects a bloodrager spell he knows of 2nd level or lower to himself. The spell must have a range of touch or personal. If the spell&#146;s duration is greater than 1 round, it instead lasts for the duration of the bloodrage. This use consumes a bloodrager spell slot, as if he had cast the spell; he must have the spell slot available to take advantage of this effect.</p>
					<p>Greater bloodrage counts as the barbarian&#146;s greater rage ability for the purposes of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a bloodrager gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells while bloodraging. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves he also receives during his bloodrage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 17th level, a bloodrager no longer becomes fatigued at the end of his bloodrage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 20th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +8, and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +4. Furthermore, the spell he can apply to himself at the beginning of a bloodrage due to the greater bloodrage class feature is not limited to only spells of 2nd level or lower.</p>

Temporary increases to Constitution (such as those gained from bloodraging or spells like bear&#146;s endurance) don&#146;t increase the total number of rounds that a bloodrager can bloodrage per day. The total number of rounds of bloodrage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours need not be consecutive.</p>
							<p>A bloodrager can enter a bloodrage as a free action. While in a bloodrage, a bloodrager gains a +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, he takes a &#150;2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the bloodrager 2 hit points per Hit Die, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While bloodraging, a bloodrager cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
							<p>A bloodrager can end his bloodrage as a free action. When the bloodrage ends, he&#146;s fatigued for a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent in the bloodrage. A bloodrager cannot enter a new bloodrage while fatigued or exhausted, but can otherwise enter bloodrage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a bloodrager falls unconscious, his bloodrage immediately ends, placing him in peril of death.</p>
							<p>Bloodrage counts as the barbarian&#146;s rage class feature for the purpose of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>

						<text type="formattedtext">
							<p>Each bloodrager has a source of magic somewhere in his heritage that empowers his bloodrages, bonus feats, and bonus spells. Sometimes this source reflects a distant blood relationship to a powerful being, or is due to an extreme event involving such a creature somewhere in his family&#146;s past. Regardless of the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways. A bloodrager must pick one bloodline upon taking his first level of bloodrager. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
							<p>When choosing a bloodline, the bloodrager&#146;s alignment doesn&#146;t restrict his choices. A good bloodrager could come from an abyssal bloodline, a celestial bloodline could beget an evil bloodrager generations later, a bloodrager from an infernal bloodline could be chaotic, and so on. Though his bloodline empowers him, it doesn&#146;t dictate or limit his thoughts and behavior.</p>
							<p>The bloodrager gains bloodline powers at 1st level, 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter. The bloodline powers a bloodrager gains are described in his chosen bloodline. For all spell-like bloodline powers, treat the character&#146;s bloodrager level as the caster level.</p>
							<p>At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager receives one bonus feat chosen from a list specific to each bloodline. The bloodrager must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats.</p>
							<p>At 7th, 10th, 13th, and 16th levels, a bloodrager learns an additional spell derived from his bloodline. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 1&#150;4. These spells cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
							<p>If the bloodrager takes levels in another class that grants a bloodline, the bloodlines must be the same type, even if that means that the bloodline of one of the classes must change. Subject to GM discretion, the bloodrager can change his former bloodline to make them conform.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>While most bloodragers manifest only one bloodline, there are some that, through some quirk of heredity or the conjunction of other powers, manifest two. This combination of two distinct bloodlines can create a versatile and powerful rager who stands out among the horde.</i></p>
					<p><i>A crossblooded rager selects two different bloodlines. He gains access to the feats, bonus spells, and some of the powers of both bloodlines he is descended from, but at the cost of reducing mental clarity (see Drawbacks below). If the crossblooded rager already has a bloodline from another class, one of the chosen bloodlines must be that bloodline.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>While many ferocious combatants can tap into a deep reservoir of buried rage, bloodragers have an intrinsic power that seethes within. Like sorcerers, bloodragers&#146; veins surge with arcane power. While sorcerers use this power for spellcasting, bloodragers enter an altered state in which their bloodline becomes manifest, where the echoes of their strange ancestry lash out with devastating power. In these states, bloodragers can cast some arcane spells instinctively. The bloodrager&#146;s magic is as fast, violent, and seemingly unstoppable as their physical prowess.</p>
					<p><b>Role: </b>Masters of the battlefield, bloodragers unleash fearful carnage on their enemies using their bloodlines and combat prowess. The bloodrager&#146;s place is on the front lines, right in his enemies&#146; faces, supplying tremendous martial force bolstered by a trace of arcane magic.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
					<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
					<p><b>Parent Class(es) </b>: Barbarian and sorcerer.</p>
					<p><b>Starting Wealth </b>: 3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
					<h>Class Skills</h>
					<p>The Bloodrager's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Perception (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
					<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Bloodragers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A bloodrager can cast bloodrager spells while wearing light armor or medium armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a bloodrager wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
					<p><b>Bonus Feats: </b>A crossblooded rager combines the bonus feat lists from both of his bloodlines and can select his bloodline bonus feats from this combined list.</p>
					<p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>A crossblooded rager can select his bonus spells from either of his bloodlines. He can also learn a lower-level bonus spell he did not choose in place of the higher-level bonus spell he would normally gain. Lowerlevel bonus spells learned in this manner are always the spell level that they would be if the crossblooded rager had learned them with the appropriate bonus spell.</p>
					<p>For example: A 7th-level aberrant/abyssal crossblooded rager has the choice of learning enlarge person or ray of enfeeblement as his bloodline bonus spell. If he selected ray of enfeeblement as his 7th-level bonus spell, at 10th level he could use his new bonus spell to learn enlarge person instead of bull&#146;s strength or see invisibility, and he would add it to his list of 1st-level spells known (just as if he had learned it as his 7th-level bonus spell).</p>
					<p><b>Bloodline Powers: </b>At 1st, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th levels, a crossblooded rager gains one of the two new bloodline powers available to him at that level. He can instead select a lower-level bloodline power he did not choose in place of one of these high-level powers.</p>
					<p><b>Drawbacks: </b>The furious mix of arcane power inside a crossblooded rager forces him to constantly expend mental effort to remain focused on his current situation and needs. This leaves him with less mental resolve available to deal with external threats. A crossblooded rager takes a &#150;2 penalty to all Will saving throws at all times, and does not gain the +2 morale bonus on Will saving throws while bloodraging&#151;though he does gain a +1 morale bonus Will saving throws when he gains the greater bloodrage class feature, which increases to a +2 morale bonus on saving throws upon gaining the mighty bloodrage class feature.</p>
					<p><b>Bloodline: </b>Each bloodrager has a source of magic somewhere in his heritage that empowers his bloodrages, bonus feats, and bonus spells. Sometimes this source reflects a distant blood relationship to a powerful being, or is due to an extreme event involving such a creature somewhere in his family&#146;s past. Regardless of the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways. A bloodrager must pick one bloodline upon taking his first level of bloodrager. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
					<p>When choosing a bloodline, the bloodrager&#146;s alignment doesn&#146;t restrict his choices. A good bloodrager could come from an abyssal bloodline, a celestial bloodline could beget an evil bloodrager generations later, a bloodrager from an infernal bloodline could be chaotic, and so on. Though his bloodline empowers him, it doesn&#146;t dictate or limit his thoughts and behavior.</p>
					<p>The bloodrager gains bloodline powers at 1st level, 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter. The bloodline powers a bloodrager gains are described in his chosen bloodline. For all spell-like bloodline powers, treat the character&#146;s bloodrager level as the caster level.</p>
					<p>At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager receives one bonus feat chosen from a list specific to each bloodline. The bloodrager must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats.</p>
					<p>At 7th, 10th, 13th, and 16th levels, a bloodrager learns an additional spell derived from his bloodline. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 1&#150;4. These spells cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
					<p>If the bloodrager takes levels in another class that grants a bloodline, the bloodlines must be the same type, even if that means that the bloodline of one of the classes must change. Subject to GM discretion, the bloodrager can change his former bloodline to make them conform.</p>
					<p><b>Bloodrage (Su): </b>The bloodrager&#146;s source of internal power grants him the ability to bloodrage. At 1st level, a bloodrager can bloodrage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, he can bloodrage for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution (such as those gained from bloodraging or spells like bear&#146;s endurance) don&#146;t increase the total number of rounds that a bloodrager can bloodrage per day. The total number of rounds of bloodrage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours need not be consecutive.</p>
					<p>A bloodrager can enter a bloodrage as a free action. While in a bloodrage, a bloodrager gains a +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, he takes a &#150;2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the bloodrager 2 hit points per Hit Die, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While bloodraging, a bloodrager cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A bloodrager can end his bloodrage as a free action. When the bloodrage ends, he&#146;s fatigued for a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent in the bloodrage. A bloodrager cannot enter a new bloodrage while fatigued or exhausted, but can otherwise enter bloodrage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a bloodrager falls unconscious, his bloodrage immediately ends, placing him in peril of death.</p>
					<p>Bloodrage counts as the barbarian&#146;s rage class feature for the purpose of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>
					<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex): </b>A bloodrager&#146;s land speed is faster than is normal for his race by 10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the bloodrager&#146;s speed due to any armor worn or load carried. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the bloodrager&#146;s land speed.</p>
					<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 2nd level, a bloodrager can react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A bloodrager with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
					<p>If a bloodrager already possesses uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
					<p><b>Blood Sanctuary (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, due to the power of his blood, a bloodrager can stand confidently amid the effects of spells cast by himself or his allies. He gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells that he or an ally casts.</p>
					<p><b>Blood Casting (Su): </b>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains the ability to cast spells even while bloodraging. He can also cast these spells defensively and can make concentration checks for these spells while bloodraging. While bloodraging, he can cast and concentrate on only his bloodrager spells (see below); spells from other classes cannot be cast during this state.</p>
					<p><b>Eschew Materials: </b>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains Eschew Materials as a bonus feat.</p>
					<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a bloodrager gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells drawn from the bloodrager spell list. To learn or cast a spell, a bloodrager must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. He can cast spells he knows without preparing them ahead of time. The saving throw DC against a bloodrager&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the bloodrager&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a bloodrager can cast only a certain number of spells of each level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;3. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (Table 1-3: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). The bloodrager does not need to prepare these spells in advance; he can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he hasn&#146;t yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
					<p>The bloodrager&#146;s selection of spells is limited. At 4th level, a bloodrager knows two 1st-level spells of his choice. A bloodrager gains more spells as he increases in level, as indicated on Table 1&#150;4. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bloodrager knows is not affected by his Charisma score, but it is affected by any bonus spells he gains from his bloodline. At 8th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. This swap follows all the same rules as for a sorcerer.</p>
					<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a bloodrager can no longer be flanked. This defense denies rogues (or other classes with the sneak attack ability) the ability to sneak attack the bloodrager by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels (or levels in the class granting sneak attack) than the target has bloodrager levels.</p>
					<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack when determining the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a bloodrager gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the bloodrager takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every 3 levels thereafter, this damage reduction increases by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 11th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +3. In addition, upon entering a bloodrage, the bloodrager can apply the effects a bloodrager spell he knows of 2nd level or lower to himself. The spell must have a range of touch or personal. If the spell&#146;s duration is greater than 1 round, it instead lasts for the duration of the bloodrage. This use consumes a bloodrager spell slot, as if he had cast the spell; he must have the spell slot available to take advantage of this effect.</p>
					<p>Greater bloodrage counts as the barbarian&#146;s greater rage ability for the purposes of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a bloodrager gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells while bloodraging. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves he also receives during his bloodrage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 17th level, a bloodrager no longer becomes fatigued at the end of his bloodrage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 20th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +8, and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +4. Furthermore, the spell he can apply to himself at the beginning of a bloodrage due to the greater bloodrage class feature is not limited to only spells of 2nd level or lower.</p>

							<p>Each bloodrager has a source of magic somewhere in his heritage that empowers his bloodrages, bonus feats, and bonus spells. Sometimes this source reflects a distant blood relationship to a powerful being, or is due to an extreme event involving such a creature somewhere in his family&#146;s past. Regardless of the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways. A bloodrager must pick one bloodline upon taking his first level of bloodrager. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
							<p>When choosing a bloodline, the bloodrager&#146;s alignment doesn&#146;t restrict his choices. A good bloodrager could come from an abyssal bloodline, a celestial bloodline could beget an evil bloodrager generations later, a bloodrager from an infernal bloodline could be chaotic, and so on.

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>Bloodragers are frequently rough-and-ready, untrained scrappers who learn to exploit any advantage to gain the upper hand in a fight. The bloody-knuckled rowdy focuses on tricks and maneuvers that are quick and effective, duplicating combat styles from professional brawlers, street thugs, and even trapped animals. Rather than focusing on a single style, most bloody-knuckled rowdies dabble in multiple techniques, mixing and matching their array of vicious maneuvers to suit the occasion.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>While many ferocious combatants can tap into a deep reservoir of buried rage, bloodragers have an intrinsic power that seethes within. Like sorcerers, bloodragers&#146; veins surge with arcane power. While sorcerers use this power for spellcasting, bloodragers enter an altered state in which their bloodline becomes manifest, where the echoes of their strange ancestry lash out with devastating power. In these states, bloodragers can cast some arcane spells instinctively. The bloodrager&#146;s magic is as fast, violent, and seemingly unstoppable as their physical prowess.</p>
					<p><b>Role: </b>Masters of the battlefield, bloodragers unleash fearful carnage on their enemies using their bloodlines and combat prowess. The bloodrager&#146;s place is on the front lines, right in his enemies&#146; faces, supplying tremendous martial force bolstered by a trace of arcane magic.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
					<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
					<p><b>Parent Class(es) </b>: Barbarian and sorcerer.</p>
					<p><b>Starting Wealth </b>: 3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
					<h>Class Skills</h>
					<p>The Bloodrager's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Perception (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
					<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Bloodragers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A bloodrager can cast bloodrager spells while wearing light armor or medium armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a bloodrager wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
					<p><b>Bloodline: </b>Each bloodrager has a source of magic somewhere in his heritage that empowers his bloodrages, bonus feats, and bonus spells. Sometimes this source reflects a distant blood relationship to a powerful being, or is due to an extreme event involving such a creature somewhere in his family&#146;s past. Regardless of the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways. A bloodrager must pick one bloodline upon taking his first level of bloodrager. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
					<p>When choosing a bloodline, the bloodrager&#146;s alignment doesn&#146;t restrict his choices. A good bloodrager could come from an abyssal bloodline, a celestial bloodline could beget an evil bloodrager generations later, a bloodrager from an infernal bloodline could be chaotic, and so on. Though his bloodline empowers him, it doesn&#146;t dictate or limit his thoughts and behavior.</p>
					<p>The bloodrager gains bloodline powers at 1st level, 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter. The bloodline powers a bloodrager gains are described in his chosen bloodline. For all spell-like bloodline powers, treat the character&#146;s bloodrager level as the caster level.</p>
					<p>At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager receives one bonus feat chosen from a list specific to each bloodline. The bloodrager must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats.</p>
					<p>At 7th, 10th, 13th, and 16th levels, a bloodrager learns an additional spell derived from his bloodline. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 1&#150;4. These spells cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
					<p>If the bloodrager takes levels in another class that grants a bloodline, the bloodlines must be the same type, even if that means that the bloodline of one of the classes must change. Subject to GM discretion, the bloodrager can change his former bloodline to make them conform.</p>
					<p><b>Bloodrage (Su): </b>The bloodrager&#146;s source of internal power grants him the ability to bloodrage. At 1st level, a bloodrager can bloodrage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, he can bloodrage for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution (such as those gained from bloodraging or spells like bear&#146;s endurance) don&#146;t increase the total number of rounds that a bloodrager can bloodrage per day. The total number of rounds of bloodrage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours need not be consecutive.</p>
					<p>A bloodrager can enter a bloodrage as a free action. While in a bloodrage, a bloodrager gains a +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, he takes a &#150;2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the bloodrager 2 hit points per Hit Die, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While bloodraging, a bloodrager cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A bloodrager can end his bloodrage as a free action. When the bloodrage ends, he&#146;s fatigued for a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent in the bloodrage. A bloodrager cannot enter a new bloodrage while fatigued or exhausted, but can otherwise enter bloodrage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a bloodrager falls unconscious, his bloodrage immediately ends, placing him in peril of death.</p>
					<p>Bloodrage counts as the barbarian&#146;s rage class feature for the purpose of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>
					<p><b>Bloody Knuckles: </b>The bloody-knuckled rowdy does not gain damage reduction.</p>
					<p><b>Pugilist (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a bloody-knuckled rowdy gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. This ability replaces fast movement.</p>
					<p><b>Combat Style Student: </b>At 2nd level, a bloody-knuckled rowdy gains a bonus feat. This bonus feat must be a style feat or a feat with a style feat as a prerequisite. The bloody-knuckled rowdy treats his bloodrager levels as monk levels when qualifying for and calculating the effects of style feats and feats that have style feats as prerequisites. At 5th level, the bloody-knuckled rowdy gains the Combat Style Master feat. He doesn&#146;t need to meet the prerequisites for this feat. This ability replaces uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge.</p>
					<p><b>Hand-to-Hand Training (Ex): </b>At 3rd level, a bloody-knuckled rowdy deals unarmed damage as a monk of a level equal to his bloodrager level &#150; 2.</p>
					<p><b>Blood Casting (Su): </b>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains the ability to cast spells even while bloodraging. He can also cast these spells defensively and can make concentration checks for these spells while bloodraging. While bloodraging, he can cast and concentrate on only his bloodrager spells (see below); spells from other classes cannot be cast during this state.</p>
					<p><b>Eschew Materials: </b>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains Eschew Materials as a bonus feat.</p>
					<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a bloodrager gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells drawn from the bloodrager spell list. To learn or cast a spell, a bloodrager must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. He can cast spells he knows without preparing them ahead of time. The saving throw DC against a bloodrager&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the bloodrager&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a bloodrager can cast only a certain number of spells of each level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;3. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (Table 1-3: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). The bloodrager does not need to prepare these spells in advance; he can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he hasn&#146;t yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
					<p>The bloodrager&#146;s selection of spells is limited. At 4th level, a bloodrager knows two 1st-level spells of his choice. A bloodrager gains more spells as he increases in level, as indicated on Table 1&#150;4. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bloodrager knows is not affected by his Charisma score, but it is affected by any bonus spells he gains from his bloodline. At 8th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. This swap follows all the same rules as for a sorcerer.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a bloodrager gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the bloodrager takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every 3 levels thereafter, this damage reduction increases by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 11th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +3. In addition, upon entering a bloodrage, the bloodrager can apply the effects a bloodrager spell he knows of 2nd level or lower to himself. The spell must have a range of touch or personal. If the spell&#146;s duration is greater than 1 round, it instead lasts for the duration of the bloodrage. This use consumes a bloodrager spell slot, as if he had cast the spell; he must have the spell slot available to take advantage of this effect.</p>
					<p>Greater bloodrage counts as the barbarian&#146;s greater rage ability for the purposes of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a bloodrager gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells while bloodraging. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves he also receives during his bloodrage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 17th level, a bloodrager no longer becomes fatigued at the end of his bloodrage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 20th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +8, and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +4. Furthermore, the spell he can apply to himself at the beginning of a bloodrage due to the greater bloodrage class feature is not limited to only spells of 2nd level or lower.</p>

This companion must be one he is capable of riding and suitable as a mount. A Medium bloodrider can select a camel or a horse. A Small bloodrider can select a pony or wolf, but can also select a boar or riding dog if he is at least 8th level.

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>In the world&#146;s wild lands, a mount is an advantage in both everyday life and the dealing of death. In many barbarian tribes, the true stature of a warrior is determined by his skill and ferocity on horseback. Other tribes measure it in skill atop whatever terrible mounts their people employ. A number of bloodragers are not only skilled in the art of mounted combat, but have learned to channel their arcane energies directly into their mount.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>While many ferocious combatants can tap into a deep reservoir of buried rage, bloodragers have an intrinsic power that seethes within. Like sorcerers, bloodragers&#146; veins surge with arcane power. While sorcerers use this power for spellcasting, bloodragers enter an altered state in which their bloodline becomes manifest, where the echoes of their strange ancestry lash out with devastating power. In these states, bloodragers can cast some arcane spells instinctively. The bloodrager&#146;s magic is as fast, violent, and seemingly unstoppable as their physical prowess.</p>
					<p><b>Role: </b>Masters of the battlefield, bloodragers unleash fearful carnage on their enemies using their bloodlines and combat prowess. The bloodrager&#146;s place is on the front lines, right in his enemies&#146; faces, supplying tremendous martial force bolstered by a trace of arcane magic.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
					<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
					<p><b>Parent Class(es) </b>: Barbarian and sorcerer.</p>
					<p><b>Starting Wealth </b>: 3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
					<h>Class Skills</h>
					<p>The Bloodrager's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Perception (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
					<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Bloodragers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A bloodrager can cast bloodrager spells while wearing light armor or medium armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a bloodrager wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
					<p><b>Bloodline: </b>Each bloodrager has a source of magic somewhere in his heritage that empowers his bloodrages, bonus feats, and bonus spells. Sometimes this source reflects a distant blood relationship to a powerful being, or is due to an extreme event involving such a creature somewhere in his family&#146;s past. Regardless of the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways. A bloodrager must pick one bloodline upon taking his first level of bloodrager. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
					<p>When choosing a bloodline, the bloodrager&#146;s alignment doesn&#146;t restrict his choices. A good bloodrager could come from an abyssal bloodline, a celestial bloodline could beget an evil bloodrager generations later, a bloodrager from an infernal bloodline could be chaotic, and so on. Though his bloodline empowers him, it doesn&#146;t dictate or limit his thoughts and behavior.</p>
					<p>The bloodrager gains bloodline powers at 1st level, 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter. The bloodline powers a bloodrager gains are described in his chosen bloodline. For all spell-like bloodline powers, treat the character&#146;s bloodrager level as the caster level.</p>
					<p>At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager receives one bonus feat chosen from a list specific to each bloodline. The bloodrager must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats.</p>
					<p>At 7th, 10th, 13th, and 16th levels, a bloodrager learns an additional spell derived from his bloodline. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 1&#150;4. These spells cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
					<p>If the bloodrager takes levels in another class that grants a bloodline, the bloodlines must be the same type, even if that means that the bloodline of one of the classes must change. Subject to GM discretion, the bloodrager can change his former bloodline to make them conform.</p>
					<p><b>Bloodrage (Su): </b>The bloodrager&#146;s source of internal power grants him the ability to bloodrage. At 1st level, a bloodrager can bloodrage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, he can bloodrage for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution (such as those gained from bloodraging or spells like bear&#146;s endurance) don&#146;t increase the total number of rounds that a bloodrager can bloodrage per day. The total number of rounds of bloodrage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours need not be consecutive.</p>
					<p>A bloodrager can enter a bloodrage as a free action. While in a bloodrage, a bloodrager gains a +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, he takes a &#150;2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the bloodrager 2 hit points per Hit Die, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While bloodraging, a bloodrager cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A bloodrager can end his bloodrage as a free action. When the bloodrage ends, he&#146;s fatigued for a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent in the bloodrage. A bloodrager cannot enter a new bloodrage while fatigued or exhausted, but can otherwise enter bloodrage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a bloodrager falls unconscious, his bloodrage immediately ends, placing him in peril of death.</p>
					<p>Bloodrage counts as the barbarian&#146;s rage class feature for the purpose of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>
					<p><b>Fast Rider (Ex): </b>The bloodrider is adept at pushing his mount to its limit. The speed of any mount the bloodrager rides increases by 10 feet. This ability replaces fast movement.</p>
					<p><b>Blood Sanctuary (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, due to the power of his blood, a bloodrager can stand confidently amid the effects of spells cast by himself or his allies. He gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells that he or an ally casts.</p>
					<p><b>Blood Casting (Su): </b>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains the ability to cast spells even while bloodraging. He can also cast these spells defensively and can make concentration checks for these spells while bloodraging. While bloodraging, he can cast and concentrate on only his bloodrager spells (see below); spells from other classes cannot be cast during this state.</p>
					<p><b>Eschew Materials: </b>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains Eschew Materials as a bonus feat.</p>
					<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a bloodrager gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells drawn from the bloodrager spell list. To learn or cast a spell, a bloodrager must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. He can cast spells he knows without preparing them ahead of time. The saving throw DC against a bloodrager&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the bloodrager&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a bloodrager can cast only a certain number of spells of each level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;3. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (Table 1-3: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). The bloodrager does not need to prepare these spells in advance; he can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he hasn&#146;t yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
					<p>The bloodrager&#146;s selection of spells is limited. At 4th level, a bloodrager knows two 1st-level spells of his choice. A bloodrager gains more spells as he increases in level, as indicated on Table 1&#150;4. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bloodrager knows is not affected by his Charisma score, but it is affected by any bonus spells he gains from his bloodline. At 8th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. This swap follows all the same rules as for a sorcerer.</p>
					<p><b>Feral Mount (Ex): </b>At 5th level, the bloodrider gains the service of a feral mount. This ability functions as the druid&#146;s animal companion, using the bloodrager&#146;s level &#150; 4 as his effective druid level. This companion must be one he is capable of riding and suitable as a mount. A Medium bloodrider can select a camel or a horse. A Small bloodrider can select a pony or wolf, but can also select a boar or riding dog if he is at least 8th level. Whenever a bloodrider is bloodraging, this feral mount gains a +2 morale bonus to its Strength. This ability replaces uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a bloodrager gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the bloodrager takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every 3 levels thereafter, this damage reduction increases by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Blood Bond (Su): </b>At 9th level, the bloodrider and his feral mount gain a closer bond that allows the bloodrider to augment his mount based on his bloodline. While the bloodrider is bloodraging and on his feral mount, he grants the mount all the immunities and resistances he gains from bloodline powers. Furthermore, whenever the bloodrager is affected by a spell or spell-like ability with the range of personal while on the feral mount, the feral mount also gains the benefit of that spell. This ability replaces the bloodline feat gained at 9th level.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 11th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +3. In addition, upon entering a bloodrage, the bloodrager can apply the effects a bloodrager spell he knows of 2nd level or lower to himself. The spell must have a range of touch or personal. If the spell&#146;s duration is greater than 1 round, it instead lasts for the duration of the bloodrage. This use consumes a bloodrager spell slot, as if he had cast the spell; he must have the spell slot available to take advantage of this effect.</p>
					<p>Greater bloodrage counts as the barbarian&#146;s greater rage ability for the purposes of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>
					<p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a bloodrager gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells while bloodraging. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves he also receives during his bloodrage.</p>
					<p><b>Tireless Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 17th level, a bloodrager no longer becomes fatigued at the end of his bloodrage.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 20th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +8, and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +4. Furthermore, the spell he can apply to himself at the beginning of a bloodrage due to the greater bloodrage class feature is not limited to only spells of 2nd level or lower.</p>

At 1st level, a bloodrager can bloodrage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, he can bloodrage for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution (such as those gained from bloodraging or spells like bear&#146;s endurance) don&#146;t increase the total number of rounds that a bloodrager can bloodrage per day. The total number of rounds of bloodrage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours need not be consecutive.</p>
							<p>A bloodrager can enter a bloodrage as a free action. While in a bloodrage, a bloodrager gains a +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, he takes a &#150;2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the bloodrager 2 hit points per Hit Die, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While bloodraging, a bloodrager cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>

							<p>Each bloodrager has a source of magic somewhere in his heritage that empowers his bloodrages, bonus feats, and bonus spells. Sometimes this source reflects a distant blood relationship to a powerful being, or is due to an extreme event involving such a creature somewhere in his family&#146;s past. Regardless of the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways. A bloodrager must pick one bloodline upon taking his first level of bloodrager. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
							<p>When choosing a bloodline, the bloodrager&#146;s alignment doesn&#146;t restrict his choices. A good bloodrager could come from an abyssal bloodline, a celestial bloodline could beget an evil bloodrager generations later, a bloodrager from an infernal bloodline could be chaotic, and so on. Though his bloodline empowers him, it doesn&#146;t dictate or limit his thoughts and behavior.</p>
							<p>The bloodrager gains bloodline powers at 1st level, 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter. The bloodline powers a bloodrager gains are described in his chosen bloodline. For all spell-like bloodline powers, treat the character&#146;s bloodrager level as the caster level.</p>

							<p>If the bloodrager takes levels in another class that grants a bloodline, the bloodlines must be the same type, even if that means that the bloodline of one of the classes must change. Subject to GM discretion, the bloodrager can change his former bloodline to make them conform.</p>

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>Blood conduits learn to channel their arcane might directly through their flesh, without the need for mystical words or gestures.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>While many ferocious combatants can tap into a deep reservoir of buried rage, bloodragers have an intrinsic power that seethes within. Like sorcerers, bloodragers&#146; veins surge with arcane power. While sorcerers use this power for spellcasting, bloodragers enter an altered state in which their bloodline becomes manifest, where the echoes of their strange ancestry lash out with devastating power. In these states, bloodragers can cast some arcane spells instinctively. The bloodrager&#146;s magic is as fast, violent, and seemingly unstoppable as their physical prowess.</p>
					<p><b>Role: </b>Masters of the battlefield, bloodragers unleash fearful carnage on their enemies using their bloodlines and combat prowess. The bloodrager&#146;s place is on the front lines, right in his enemies&#146; faces, supplying tremendous martial force bolstered by a trace of arcane magic.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
					<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
					<p><b>Parent Class(es) </b>: Barbarian and sorcerer.</p>
					<p><b>Starting Wealth </b>: 3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
					<h>Class Skills</h>
					<p>The Bloodrager's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Perception (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
					<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Bloodragers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A bloodrager can cast bloodrager spells while wearing light armor or medium armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a bloodrager wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
					<p><b>Bloodline: </b>Each bloodrager has a source of magic somewhere in his heritage that empowers his bloodrages, bonus feats, and bonus spells. Sometimes this source reflects a distant blood relationship to a powerful being, or is due to an extreme event involving such a creature somewhere in his family&#146;s past. Regardless of the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways. A bloodrager must pick one bloodline upon taking his first level of bloodrager. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
					<p>When choosing a bloodline, the bloodrager&#146;s alignment doesn&#146;t restrict his choices. A good bloodrager could come from an abyssal bloodline, a celestial bloodline could beget an evil bloodrager generations later, a bloodrager from an infernal bloodline could be chaotic, and so on. Though his bloodline empowers him, it doesn&#146;t dictate or limit his thoughts and behavior.</p>
					<p>The bloodrager gains bloodline powers at 1st level, 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter. The bloodline powers a bloodrager gains are described in his chosen bloodline. For all spell-like bloodline powers, treat the character&#146;s bloodrager level as the caster level.</p>
					<p>At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager receives one bonus feat chosen from a list specific to each bloodline. The bloodrager must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats.</p>
					<p>At 7th, 10th, 13th, and 16th levels, a bloodrager learns an additional spell derived from his bloodline. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 1&#150;4. These spells cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
					<p>If the bloodrager takes levels in another class that grants a bloodline, the bloodlines must be the same type, even if that means that the bloodline of one of the classes must change. Subject to GM discretion, the bloodrager can change his former bloodline to make them conform.</p>
					<p><b>Bloodrage (Su): </b>The bloodrager&#146;s source of internal power grants him the ability to bloodrage. At 1st level, a bloodrager can bloodrage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, he can bloodrage for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution (such as those gained from bloodraging or spells like bear&#146;s endurance) don&#146;t increase the total number of rounds that a bloodrager can bloodrage per day. The total number of rounds of bloodrage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours need not be consecutive.</p>
					<p>A bloodrager can enter a bloodrage as a free action. While in a bloodrage, a bloodrager gains a +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, he takes a &#150;2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the bloodrager 2 hit points per Hit Die, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While bloodraging, a bloodrager cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A bloodrager can end his bloodrage as a free action. When the bloodrage ends, he&#146;s fatigued for a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent in the bloodrage. A bloodrager cannot enter a new bloodrage while fatigued or exhausted, but can otherwise enter bloodrage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a bloodrager falls unconscious, his bloodrage immediately ends, placing him in peril of death.</p>
					<p>Bloodrage counts as the barbarian&#146;s rage class feature for the purpose of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>
					<p><b>Contact Specialist (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a blood conduit selects a bonus feat from the following: Improved Bull Rush, Improved Grapple, Improved Reposition, Improved Trip, and Improved Unarmed Strike. He does not need to meet the prerequisites to take this feat. He also adds those feats to his list of bloodline feats. This ability replaces fast movement and alters bloodline feats.</p>
					<p><b>Blood Sanctuary (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, due to the power of his blood, a bloodrager can stand confidently amid the effects of spells cast by himself or his allies. He gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells that he or an ally casts.</p>
					<p><b>Blood Casting (Su): </b>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains the ability to cast spells even while bloodraging. He can also cast these spells defensively and can make concentration checks for these spells while bloodraging. While bloodraging, he can cast and concentrate on only his bloodrager spells (see below); spells from other classes cannot be cast during this state.</p>
					<p><b>Eschew Materials: </b>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains Eschew Materials as a bonus feat.</p>
					<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a bloodrager gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells drawn from the bloodrager spell list. To learn or cast a spell, a bloodrager must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. He can cast spells he knows without preparing them ahead of time. The saving throw DC against a bloodrager&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the bloodrager&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a bloodrager can cast only a certain number of spells of each level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;3. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (Table 1-3: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). The bloodrager does not need to prepare these spells in advance; he can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he hasn&#146;t yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
					<p>The bloodrager&#146;s selection of spells is limited. At 4th level, a bloodrager knows two 1st-level spells of his choice. A bloodrager gains more spells as he increases in level, as indicated on Table 1&#150;4. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bloodrager knows is not affected by his Charisma score, but it is affected by any bonus spells he gains from his bloodline. At 8th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. This swap follows all the same rules as for a sorcerer.</p>
					<p><b>Spell Conduit (Su): </b>At 5th level, as long as a blood conduit is wearing light or no armor, he can deliver bloodrager spells with a range of touch through bodily contact. When he succeeds at a combat maneuver check to bull rush, grapple, pin, reposition, or trip an opponent, or makes an unarmed strike against an enemy, he can as a swift action cast a touch spell on the creature that he affected with the combat maneuver, requiring no further touch attack roll. If this spell would usually require a successful touch attack, his successful combat maneuver check counts as this attack. This ability replaces uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a bloodrager gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the bloodrager takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every 3 levels thereafter, this damage reduction increases by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 11th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +3. In addition, upon entering a bloodrage, the bloodrager can apply the effects a bloodrager spell he knows of 2nd level or lower to himself. The spell must have a range of touch or personal. If the spell&#146;s duration is greater than 1 round, it instead lasts for the duration of the bloodrage. This use consumes a bloodrager spell slot, as if he had cast the spell; he must have the spell slot available to take advantage of this effect.</p>
					<p>Greater bloodrage counts as the barbarian&#146;s greater rage ability for the purposes of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>
					<p><b>Reflexive Conduit (Ex): </b>At 14th level, a blood conduit can discharge his power into foes that attempt bodily contact with him. While wearing light or no armor, when the blood conduit is subject to a combat maneuver check made to bull rush, grapple, pin, reposition, or trip him, as an immediate action he can target his attacker with a bloodrager spell that has a range of touch. If the spell would normally require a touch attack, a blood conduit can attempt a combat maneuver check for this attack instead. This ability replaces indomitable will.</p>
					<p><b>Mighty Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 20th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +8, and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +4. Furthermore, the spell he can apply to himself at the beginning of a bloodrage due to the greater bloodrage class feature is not limited to only spells of 2nd level or lower.</p>

							<p>At 5th level, an ancestral harbinger adds summon monster I to her class spell list and gains it as a bonus spell known. She also gains summon monster II at 8th level, summon monster III at 11th level, and summon monster IV at 14th level. These spells can be used only to summon types of monsters with strong ties to the ancestral harbinger&#146;s family history, ranging from clan totems to monsters of the same type as those famously killed by her forebears. For each of these spells, the ancestral harbinger selects a number of monsters she can summon equal to her Charisma bonus (minimum 1) to represent these spirits. These monsters are selected from the options on the summon monster creature list or the expanded summoning list (see the summoning project) that are appropriate for the spell level. At 7th level and every 2 bloodrager levels thereafter, the ancestral harbinger can swap one selected monster from one of these spells for a new monster from the same level&#146;s summoning lists.</p>
							<p>The ancestral harbinger has a mystic tie to the spirit servants summoned with this ability. When the ancestral harbinger is in a bloodrage, all of her spirit servants gain a +2 morale bonus to AC and on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws. The spirit servants also gain 2 temporary hit points per Hit Die. At 11th level, the morale bonus increases to +3 and the number of temporary hit points per Hit Die increases to 3. At 20th level, the morale bonus increases to +4 and the number of temporary hit points per Hit Die increases to 4. The morale bonus and temporary hit points last until the bloodrage ends. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge and the bloodline feat gained at 12th level.</p>

At 12th level, her ancestor can manifest physically as a ghostly figure, functioning as per spiritual ally. At 18th level, her ancestral spirit can manifest either as a single powerful creature or as multiple lesser ancestors, functioning as per summon nature&#146;s ally VI.

					<h>Summary</h>
					<p><i>While all bloodragers tap into their bloodlines to fuel the arcane energies they use in battle, some have the ability to call directly to the spirits of their ancestors to aid them, summoning spirits to fight for them or inspire their allies. Ancestral harbingers are particularly common among Shoanti bloodragers and among Bonuwat tribes living along the coast of western Garund.</i></p>
					<h>Description</h>
					<p>While many ferocious combatants can tap into a deep reservoir of buried rage, bloodragers have an intrinsic power that seethes within. Like sorcerers, bloodragers&#146; veins surge with arcane power. While sorcerers use this power for spellcasting, bloodragers enter an altered state in which their bloodline becomes manifest, where the echoes of their strange ancestry lash out with devastating power. In these states, bloodragers can cast some arcane spells instinctively. The bloodrager&#146;s magic is as fast, violent, and seemingly unstoppable as their physical prowess.</p>
					<p><b>Role: </b>Masters of the battlefield, bloodragers unleash fearful carnage on their enemies using their bloodlines and combat prowess. The bloodrager&#146;s place is on the front lines, right in his enemies&#146; faces, supplying tremendous martial force bolstered by a trace of arcane magic.</p>
					<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
					<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d10.</p>
					<p><b>Parent Class(es) </b>: Barbarian and sorcerer.</p>
					<p><b>Starting Wealth </b>: 3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
					<h>Class Skills</h>
					<p>The Bloodrager's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Perception (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
					<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

					<h>Class Features</h>
					<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Bloodragers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A bloodrager can cast bloodrager spells while wearing light armor or medium armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a bloodrager wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p>
					<p><b>Bloodline: </b>Each bloodrager has a source of magic somewhere in his heritage that empowers his bloodrages, bonus feats, and bonus spells. Sometimes this source reflects a distant blood relationship to a powerful being, or is due to an extreme event involving such a creature somewhere in his family&#146;s past. Regardless of the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways. A bloodrager must pick one bloodline upon taking his first level of bloodrager. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
					<p>When choosing a bloodline, the bloodrager&#146;s alignment doesn&#146;t restrict his choices. A good bloodrager could come from an abyssal bloodline, a celestial bloodline could beget an evil bloodrager generations later, a bloodrager from an infernal bloodline could be chaotic, and so on. Though his bloodline empowers him, it doesn&#146;t dictate or limit his thoughts and behavior.</p>
					<p>The bloodrager gains bloodline powers at 1st level, 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter. The bloodline powers a bloodrager gains are described in his chosen bloodline. For all spell-like bloodline powers, treat the character&#146;s bloodrager level as the caster level.</p>
					<p>At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager receives one bonus feat chosen from a list specific to each bloodline. The bloodrager must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats.</p>
					<p>At 7th, 10th, 13th, and 16th levels, a bloodrager learns an additional spell derived from his bloodline. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 1&#150;4. These spells cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
					<p>If the bloodrager takes levels in another class that grants a bloodline, the bloodlines must be the same type, even if that means that the bloodline of one of the classes must change. Subject to GM discretion, the bloodrager can change his former bloodline to make them conform.</p>
					<p><b>Bloodrage (Su): </b>The bloodrager&#146;s source of internal power grants him the ability to bloodrage. At 1st level, a bloodrager can bloodrage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, he can bloodrage for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution (such as those gained from bloodraging or spells like bear&#146;s endurance) don&#146;t increase the total number of rounds that a bloodrager can bloodrage per day. The total number of rounds of bloodrage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours need not be consecutive.</p>
					<p>A bloodrager can enter a bloodrage as a free action. While in a bloodrage, a bloodrager gains a +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, he takes a &#150;2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the bloodrager 2 hit points per Hit Die, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While bloodraging, a bloodrager cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
					<p>A bloodrager can end his bloodrage as a free action. When the bloodrage ends, he&#146;s fatigued for a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent in the bloodrage. A bloodrager cannot enter a new bloodrage while fatigued or exhausted, but can otherwise enter bloodrage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a bloodrager falls unconscious, his bloodrage immediately ends, placing him in peril of death.</p>
					<p>Bloodrage counts as the barbarian&#146;s rage class feature for the purpose of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>
					<p><b>Fast Movement (Ex): </b>A bloodrager&#146;s land speed is faster than is normal for his race by 10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the bloodrager&#146;s speed due to any armor worn or load carried. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the bloodrager&#146;s land speed.</p>
					<p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex) </b>: At 2nd level, a bloodrager can react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A bloodrager with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p>
					<p>If a bloodrager already possesses uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
					<p><b>Blood Sanctuary (Su) </b>: At 3rd level, due to the power of his blood, a bloodrager can stand confidently amid the effects of spells cast by himself or his allies. He gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells that he or an ally casts.</p>
					<p><b>Blood Casting (Su): </b>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains the ability to cast spells even while bloodraging. He can also cast these spells defensively and can make concentration checks for these spells while bloodraging. While bloodraging, he can cast and concentrate on only his bloodrager spells (see below); spells from other classes cannot be cast during this state.</p>
					<p><b>Eschew Materials: </b>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains Eschew Materials as a bonus feat.</p>
					<p><b>Spells: </b>Beginning at 4th level, a bloodrager gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells drawn from the bloodrager spell list. To learn or cast a spell, a bloodrager must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. He can cast spells he knows without preparing them ahead of time. The saving throw DC against a bloodrager&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the bloodrager&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, a bloodrager can cast only a certain number of spells of each level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1&#150;3. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (Table 1-3: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). The bloodrager does not need to prepare these spells in advance; he can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he hasn&#146;t yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell&#146;s level.</p>
					<p>The bloodrager&#146;s selection of spells is limited. At 4th level, a bloodrager knows two 1st-level spells of his choice. A bloodrager gains more spells as he increases in level, as indicated on Table 1&#150;4. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bloodrager knows is not affected by his Charisma score, but it is affected by any bonus spells he gains from his bloodline. At 8th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. This swap follows all the same rules as for a sorcerer.</p>
					<p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 5th level, a bloodrager can no longer be flanked. This defense denies rogues (or other classes with the sneak attack ability) the ability to sneak attack the bloodrager by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels (or levels in the class granting sneak attack) than the target has bloodrager levels.</p>
					<p>If a character already has uncanny dodge from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack when determining the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
					<p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex): </b>At 7th level, a bloodrager gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the bloodrager takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every 3 levels thereafter, this damage reduction increases by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0.</p>
					<p><b>Greater Bloodrage (Su): </b>At 11th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +3. In addition, upon entering a bloodrage, the bloodrager can apply the effects a bloodrager spell he knows of 2nd level or lower to himself. The spell must have a range of touch or personal. If the spell&#146;s duration is greater than 1 round, it instead lasts for the duration of the bloodrage. This use consumes a bloodrager spell slot, as if he had cast the spell; he must have the spell slot available to take advantage of this effect.</p>
					<p>Greater bloodrage counts as the barbarian&#146;s greater rage ability for the purposes of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>
